This kind of self-indulgent crap is why people don't trust Hollywood comedies anymore. Not only is the cheesy message of this movie dishonest and singular to only one demographic of people, but it's a fairly obvious retread of Shallow Hal with a few key details changed. \nReplace Amy Schumer with literally anyone and it would be a little funnier, but not a whole lot, since the writing is so mediocre and predictable. \"Oh, it's what's on the INSIDE that counts! How did I not see it before?\" is the movie's realization, a message that had been beaten into the audience's head with a sledgehammer from minute one of the movie, but somehow it took this dense, unlikable, cringe-inducing protagonist an hour and a half of screen time to figure out. I laughed literally once during this film, when Schumer's character got her hair stuck in the stationary bike, which of course, is shown in the trailer. Was I laughing at the idea of Amy Schumer in pain, you ask? Possibly. Doesn't matter. Still counts as one laugh.\nJust skip it. Go see Super Troopers 2 instead and support people that actually have some talent and couldn't get their movie funded by a production company, (which leaves me to wonder how this utter abortion of a film did). ST2 isn't groundbreaking, but at least I didn't leave it wanting my money back."}

{"rating": "6", "date": ["22 April 2018"], "user_name": "Davor Blazevic", "user_id": "ur6136051", "title": "I Feel Pretty... feels sufficiently pretty and witty and bright", "content": "\"I Feel Pretty\" (2018) is not the greatest movie, but it's not a bad one either, at least not as bad as its current IMDb rating, 3.4 out of 10, shows. What's puzzling (well, only slightly, concerning the modern-days amount of preferred (?) exposure to the worlds of video games) is that movies having stories and subjects very little to do with reality: space operas, movies about superheroes... practically by default get the high rating, at least 7 out of 10, while not-at-all bad movies, but, in comparison to former, slightly unattractive since set unexcitingly in reality, get often an average, or, as in this case, a very low rating. So, which of the two is more important quality of the movies (today), having the story told well corresponding to reality, or their technical superiority?\nAnswers will offer opposing views, but numbers show that great majority of viewers appreciate later. I have also enjoyed spectacular show while watching the ginormous gorilla George (Saint George) killing the augmented alligator (slaying the dragon), in latest IMAX theatres' favourite \"Rampage\" (2018), but what's the point? There's no point, because point is supposed to make sense, and there's a little sense outside of reality. On contrary, as unimpressive as it is, \"I Feel Pretty\" is so real, and as such, more relevant in everyday life. \nAppealing factor in \"I Feel Pretty\" is the fact that movie managed to remain realistic in giving a believable reason (a head injury accident in a gym) for the main vehicle to move the story forward, i.e. for the changed perception of herself the leading character goes through, therefore gaining confidence and modifying the way she carries herself. Regular movie goer with longer viewing experience will easily recall how numerous other, pretty good movies from the past managed to be quite entertaining, but only after fantastic premise has been served. Time-traveling movies, among them the best known \"Back to the Future\" trilogy (1985, 1986, 1990) with Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, long list of body-swapping fantasies like \"Freaky Friday\" (1976) with Barbara Harris and Jodie Foster (remade in 2003 with Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan) as mother and daughter, whose personalities switch their bodies, Bill Murray's character repeatedly reliving the same day in \"Groundhog Day\" (1993), Michael Keaton's character quadrupled by cloning in \"Multiplicity\"... to name a few. So, once we accept the fantastic premise, those movies are even more entertaining than this one, but the great advantage of the movie \"I Feel Pretty\", at least great advantage for the likes of me, is that fantasy infusion has not been required.\nThanks to already experienced writers/first time directors, Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein, for coming with a realistic reason (even if already seen before, as suggested elsewhere) for particular twist that propels the story, and then to Ms. Amy Schumer for successfully presenting it in achieving quite a fluent and humoristic narrative, and making it easy to accept her character, Renee Bennett, suddenly not limited only to her inner beauty, a fact surely aided by the circumstance that actress herself doesn't even fall in to the only other category... less beautiful... long ago advised as applicable for women.\n \nContrasting the dominant, loud female lead with her quiet, not shy (to deliver the line \"Can I be you when I grow up?\") but rather laid back, eventually boyfriend Ethan (Rory Scovel) was contributive, as well.\nFinally, in her supporting role as Avery LeClair, heiress to cosmetic line, although for her corporate position apparently sufficiently highly educated and quite well looking, Michelle Williams feels unsecure and requires help, so she uses suddenly wonderfully uninhibited Renee to deal with her physical (vocal) limitations, lack of business ideas, and other frustrations of her somewhat awkward position. Already established as dramatic actress, Williams uses this chance well to skillfully break into comedic acting by spicing her character with a touch of restrained lunacy. \nIn conclusion, film is at times touching, sufficiently amusing, and positively motivating... all of which should, hopefully, help (not only) girls \"feel pretty and witty and bright!\" (Line excerpted from the musical \"West Side Story\" and its song of the same title \"I Feel Pretty\".)"}

With an acting style that is no more than an iteration of the stage persona of droning sarcasm and whiny observation Schumer repeats it here with the nuanced same character to be found in 'Wreck and Snatched and it is beyond stale at this point. She does briefly move from her self pitying mope state when she bangs her head at a gym in the films linch pin scene that allows her to be obnoxiously confident for awhile as she struts about believing to be of incomparable beauty. But most of the meager humor is extracted by way of supporting characters and extra reactions to bombastic Renee's (Schumer) outrageous narcissistic turn which wears thin fast. \nWith whatever talent she had Amy Schumer has more than exhausted it after the abysmal Snatched, the stomach churning stand-up special (The Leather Show) that followed and now this banal chic flick that if it does not push the coarse comedian's movie star career over the cliff certainly has pushed it to the edge."}

This being said, I find it hard to believe all the bad reviews (5 times more from men than woman) considering there's only been ONE screening so far and I don't think these are viewers from a pre-screening. Just a hunch. So, the majority of the reviews in are not from people who've actually seen the film. I realize there is this vast cadre of men who want to live in their fantasy that Jonah Hill and Michael Cera not only save the world but date super models or Emma Stone, and Amy Schumer messes with that fantasy lens. She's cool, get over it. Notice women don't flock to down-vote all the ridiculous kung fu and superhero movies men like, where mostly all they do is grunt. Perspective.\nOn to I Feel Pretty. I wasn't sure what to expect. Train wreck was very good and then the next one with Goldie Hawn was...okay, but just okay. I thought the Michelle William's Avery character was great. I probably wouldn't have realized it was her if I hadn't seen her name in the title. It was nice to see her doing comedy again, as she was great in that movie with Kirsten Dunst I can't say on IMDB without it getting flagged. You know, the one about Watergate. It was great to see Aidy and Sasheer from SNL. Andy has such great delivery and Sasheer is so visually expressive with her comedy. She can say a lot with just a look. I was afraid when Amy had her dialogue with Busy and Aidy it was going to get a bit too preachy about women but it didn't. It addressed it just enough then expressed the rest with the comedy. \nI'm not going to say specific moments I thought were hilarious or really got me 'cause I don't want to spoil anything, but the physical comedy was great and the Andrea Zuckerman moment was very funny for me. We were thoroughly entertained by this film. Amy Schumer really put some of her best work in this and it's a definite fun movie to see with your friends, sister, whomever."}
{"rating": "6", "date": ["19 April 2018"], "user_name": "Gavin Purtell", "user_id": "ur21319675", "title": "Slightly above-average romantic comedy", "content": "'I Feel Pretty' is a mostly-straightforward romantic comedy from the writers of 'Never Been Kissed', 'He's Just Not That Into You' and 'How To Be Single', so it's safe to assume you know pretty much what to expect. There's also a nice twist on the tried-and-tested body-switch plot - Renee (Schumer) hits her head and believes she has achieved her dream of becoming beautiful.\nRenee believing she's the hottest woman alive is where a lot of the humour comes from, but also some of the missteps - since Renee and her two friends, Jane (Phillips) and Vivian (Bryant), are not actually ugly. It's also where most of the sincere moments come from - it's not all about what you look like, but the confidence you have in yourself, highlighted in a rousing speech by Schumer near the end. She's (mostly) not too over-the-top and is (mostly) easy to cheer for.\nWhile not focusing solely on girl-meets-boy/falls-in-love/separate/get-back-together, it still manages to fit that all in, with Ethan (Scovel) a decent foil to Schumer. It's annoying that the backdrop to a film that's actually about not worrying about looks is centered around a make-up company, run by Avery (Williams) and Grant (Hopper) - both mostly pointless. Overall, it's not as good as 'Trainwreck', but nor is it a totally vapid \"chick flick\"."}

{"rating": "6", "date": ["20 April 2018"], "user_name": "David Ferguson", "user_id": "ur0806494", "title": "a message from Amy", "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Comedians taking the leap from TV to movies sometimes find the going a bit rough. Amy Schumer hit it big with critics and audiences in TRAINWRECK (2015), and then flopped with both groups in last year's SNATCHED (2017). This time out, she quells the raunchiness, and instead serves us a PG-13 message movie aimed squarely at adolescent girls. Ms. Schumer doesn't abandon comedy, it's now just a bit tamer and comes with a life lesson.\nRenee (Ms. Schumer) is a mostly normal person who works in a computer \"dungeon\" as website support for a high-end make-up company named Lily LeClaire. Adrian Martinez plays her usually unresponsive co-worker who seems quite comfortable with the lack of human interaction that comes with the daily process. When not at her dead-end job, Renee hangs out with her also mostly normal friends Vivian (Aidy Bryant) and Jane (Busy Phillips, wife of the film's co-director Marc Silverstein). Renee does seem to spend an inordinate amount of time hoping for her dream job (receptionist at Lily LeClaire headquarters) and her dream lifestyle (being beautiful and slim like the Lily LeClaire models). \nIf you've seen the trailer, you know what happens next. Renee gets conked on the head during a fitness class, and when she wakes up, she sees herself as the beautiful woman she always dreamed of becoming. Of course, her appearance hasn't changed the slightest, but the way she carries herself certainly has. Where once there was moping and hoping, there is now confidence and daring. Her self-esteem cup is overflowing and she falls into her dream job, and lands a terrific boyfriend, while also being pursued by a dreamy one.\nHer time at the company headquarters finds her interacting with CEO Avery LeClaire played with drop-dead perfect comedic timing from 4-time Oscar nominee Michelle Williams. Yes, THAT Michelle Williams! It's such a treat to see this talented actress step away from her usual dramatic characters and flat out nail a comedic role in which she seems to nearly flutter across the screen while sporting a voice that would typically only be heard in Saturday morning cartoons. The shared scenes with Ms. Schumer and Ms. Williams are the film's best, but unfortunately are too few - leaving some unexplored humor to our imaginations.\nCo-writers and co-directors Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein (first time directors, co-writers of HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU) work hard to deliver the type of humor that Amy Schumer fans expect, while also paying respect to the all-important female body image message the film strives to deliver. It's a challenging proposal, however despite my finding much of the comedy predictable, the theatre was filled with laughter from what was very likely a group of loyal Schumer fans. The bikini contest sequence seemed especially effective in generating laughter and praise from the loyalists.\nAs for the boyfriend role of nice guy Ethan, Rory Scovel may seem like an odd choice. He's the anti-Hollywood leading man type - generally laid back with no glimmer of Type A personality. A quiet guy who takes Zumba classes is actually the perfect straight man for Schumer's dominating screen personality ... she does talk incessantly through most of the movie. Other supporting roles are filled by Lauren Hutton as Lilly \"Gram\" LeClaire, the company founder and grandmother to Avery; Emily Ratajkowski as Renee's fitness class acquaintance, whose sole purpose seems to be in convincing Renee that beautiful women have life struggles too; Naomi Campbell as a company executive; and Tom Hopper (\"Game of Thrones\"), as the required eye candy for a viewing audience likely to skew heavily female.\nMs. Schumer is surely to receive backlash on the movie due to utilizing a head injury to show her character the road to self-esteem and confidence. In my opinion she should be commended for using comedy and her celebrity to send this message to the girls out there. We never know what delivery method will work, and if a fake bump on the head in a movie gets a few girls to realize success in life is not about one's physical attractiveness, then I'm on board. Of course, there are many who say I'm not qualified to review the movie since, being a male, I can't possibly understand what girls go through. And on that point, they are likely correct."}

I think she's courageous, intelligent and very funny. That is why I am very disappointed in this stinker of a movie. I actually walked out halfway through. I thought, 'do I want to spend two hours of my precious life watching this human waste'? The answer was 'no', so I left. The movie's biggest problem is that it's supposed to be a comedy, but it's not funny. \nDid anyone at the film company watch the film before they released it? Did they laugh? No one in the cinema I was in, was laughing, except possibly at the comical fall off the exercise bike at the start of the movie - Schumer is good at physical comedy.\nI Feel Pretty actually has one or two things to say. We all know people who aren't necessarily beautiful but just breeze through life because they're super-confident. \nThat's what happens to Schumer's character when she mysteriously hits her head and transforms from a painfully insecure website designer to the receptionist at a cosmetics company who thinks she's hot. As shown in the scene where Amy's character picks up a guy in a dry cleaner, often a prospective partner just loves having someone else take charge and ask them on a date.\nMichelle Williams' character, the cosmetics executive, is supposed to represent the super-attractive woman who doesn't have a clue professionally or socially. But this character is too much of a flake to be interesting - she's so squeaky-voiced and delicate she doesn't have any substance. \nAnd what's with Schumer's supposedly ''ugly'' friends? It's so offensive to portray two of her supposed best friends as losers. It's a very common device in US films, when in fact most of the population aren't supermodel perfect in looks, i.e. most people are normal. \nThe movie doesn't seem to know what to do with these friends, although I guess it's the Schumer character who is the obnoxious one.\nI think people are being unkind when they say Schumer's career is going down the toilet.

She's on a roll!\n\u00b7 Most young people won't know who Lauren Hutton is. There is a picture towards the very end of the movie that shows Lauren Hutton when she was at the peak of her modeling days as a young woman. I thought it was really fun to have her in the movie as Lily LeClaire.\n\u00b7 Yep, it's true. Kentucky Fried Chicken does use Hidden Valley Ranch dressing.\n\u00b7 I liked that the Soul Cycle teacher told all of the class participants to \"set an intention.\" If we were all more mindful and proactive about our lives, we'd be surprised at how much better things turned out. Renee (Amy Schumer) wears a sweatshirt at the beginning of the movie that says \"Get it Girl!\" which is the anthem of the movie. Take your flaws and STILL believe in yourself.\n\u00b7 It's refreshing to see how brave Amy Schumer is about making fun of herself and flaunting her more than size 2 body. Her stand-up comedy bits have always been completely honest, although extremely raunchy. I admire that she doesn't let Hollywood make her feel terrible about herself.\n\u00b7 I've been a big fan of Saturday Night Live ever since my college roommate and I would watch it together on a tiny TV in our dorm room. I love seeing a lot of the comediennes from SNL on movies lately. This one features the talented Aidy Bryant and Sasheer Zamata. \n\u00b7 You'll see a lot of beautiful women like Naomi Campbell and Emily Ratajkowski.\n\u00b7 I laughed at the beginning when the camera scanned all of Renee's beauty products in her bathroom. Most of us spend ridiculous amounts of money on products, hoping they will FINALLY be the magic pill to make us look prettier and feel better about ourselves. The ironic thing about this movie is that Renee works for a cosmetic company and her speech at the end sells more make-up.\n\n \nThings I didn't like:\n\u00b7 You know what else is attractive? Virtue and humility. While Hollywood has been pumping out a lot of \"be who you are\" movies lately, there is a serious lack of movies that celebrate women, or men for that matter, who are virtuous and humble and chaste. Religious values are, more often than not, mocked in Hollywood movies. Yeah, that doesn't exactly get laughs or sell box office tickets, but I sure would like to see more well-behaved, good girls in movies being honored for a change.\n* Everyone loved Amy Schumer when she first hit the scene, but for some reason, it's now popular to hate her. Her stand-up routines are super trashy and she seems to celebrate being a skank, but I love that she doesn't apologize for not being the skinny model that Hollywood thinks she should be.\n\u00b7 I thought it was funny that they grouped Busy Philipps with the \"average\" girlfriends, because I've always thought she was pretty.\n* I thought for sure that some time during the movie we'd hear a modern version of the famous West Side Story song, I Feel Pretty. Nope, it never played. Missed opportunity, right?\n* Women are definitely going to appreciate this movie more than men.\n\nFunny lines:\n\u00b7 \"Can I be you when I grow up?\" - Ethan (Rory Scovel) \n\nInteresting lines:\n\u00b7 \"I think a lot of people are confused about themselves.\" - Ethan\n\u00b7 \"I started to believe that if I wanted it bad enough, all my dreams could come true.\" - Renee Bennett\n\u00b7 \"What if we never lost that little girl confidence?\" - Renee\n\u00b7 \"This make-up line won't change your life - only you can do that.\" - Renee\n\u00b7 \"I know I look good. I don't need a room full of drunk guys to confirm it.\" - Renee\n\u00b7 \"I am brave. I am blonde. And I got this!\" - Mason (Adrian Martinez)"}

The jokes could be predictable at times, and perhaps the message that we should seek the beauty on the inside has been heard before, but this story had one more message for the women (and girls) out there who don't feel pretty. \nThe best message in the film was this; when she moved and expressed herself with confidence, people took notice. After hitting her head and believing that some magic made her pretty, Schumer's character predictably began behaving with more confidence and assertiveness. She was still plump, her features didn't change, but the people she came in contact with were impressed, perhaps a little awed, that she appeared to be a woman who was completely comfortable with exactly who she was. THIS is what her new beau, the people in the bar, and the beautiful people at work found attractive in her. A woman who accepted everything about herself, and did not base her self value in what other people thought of her. \nI enjoyed this movie, and it conveys a message more people should see. Accept yourself, with all of your strengths and all of your flaws. Be confident that you are worthwhile, you are enough and that fearlessness in itself, is beautiful."}

Trainwreck was okay and Snatched was not very funny at all. I liked the trailer for I Feel Pretty because it seemed like an absurd idea but one that I really wanted to see play it. I get that the film had controversy surrounding the casting and content for the premise of the film but my reviews keep outside controversies separated from the review of the film. The film has a few moments where you laugh but most of the good stuff is already in the trailer.\nThe film is about a very insecure girl named Renee and her struggles with everyday acceptance. One day she hits her head while at a soul cycle gym which changes her outlook on her appearance, despite there being no discernible change. All of a sudden her confidence skyrockets, she gets her dream job, starts hanging with a different social circle, and finds a man. Obviously, this feeling and life that she perceives cannot last forever.\nI think Schumer does a good job in the role. The film works at many stages when its not supposed to because Schumer can sell it. I'd commend Michelle Williams as well as this was a different type of role for her and it actually came off well. As mentioned earlier the laughs are sparse. The best laughs are seen in the trailer. The film srunning length doesn't help as there are passages which feel dull and unnecessary. Like the whole arc with Tom Hopper's character. The film becomes predictable as you know exactly where it goes before it gets there. The end message is a good one but one you saw coming miles away.\nOverall, I think there is so much that could have been done in terms of humor with this film but it was a missed opportunity. You had a really committed Amy Schumer to boot but didn't really deliver in the writing of the script. The film gets pretty mixed on what it wants to say as the journey goes on, which a lot of people won't like. I'm open to seeing Schumer in something better. Interesting idea, mostly failed delivery.\n6/10"}

Unattractive girl gets a head injury that causes her to see herself as beautiful and it gives her the confidence she needs to succeed. Okay. Sure. A bit insulting to Schumer, but so is everything she does.\nBut the entire movie is nothing but Schumer telling people she's so hot and sexy and those people looking at her like she's insane. A great message there. \"It doesn't matter if you think you're beautiful. Everyone else will still laugh at you because you're ugly.\" For God's sake, the entire TRAILER for this movie was muffin-top jokes, nude jokes, and Amy Schumer saying \"Look how sexy I am!\" while everyone else looked at her with disgust. And we're supposed to laugh at that?\nHere's a tip for Ms Schumer. You can consider yourself beautiful. That's great. Everyone should do it.

I think they should have stuck with the comedy part more and less on the message part. Amy-whom I really like-plays an insecure modern day woman that has low self esteem. She has an accident and bumps her head, and suddenly, she thinks that she is beautiful and she is just chock full of confidence-she doesn't look any different, she just sees herself differently when she sees her reflection. Rory becomes her new boyfriend, Busy is one of her best friends and Michelle is her boss at a fashion and make-up company. The message seems to be that women worry too much about their looks-outer beauty-and instead, they should concentrate more on their worth as a person. In other words, Amy needs to learn that her outside appearance had no effect on her abilities to perform her job or get a boyfriend, etc. She had it in her all the time. I'm sure they meant this to be a liberating message for women in this climate of the Me Too era but their execution just didn't work for me.\nIt's rated \"PG-13\" for language and sexual content-partial nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 50 minutes.\nIt's not one that I would buy on DVD but if you like Amy-I do-it would be alright as a rental."}

The premise is silly, and several plot points are ridiculous. However, there are some laugh out loud moments. Amy Schumer does a good job acting, however, I do not know if this was the best choice of actress for this role. I say this because her character lacks self-esteem for not being \"beautiful\" when she is not an ugly person to begin with. In fact, it is not even clear why she doesn't have confidence in herself in the first place. It is never said if it is a weight issue, personality issue, or any other issue she has that she deems herself as not pretty. The message that this film conveys is being able to see a person's inner beauty and not focusing on their outer appearance only. Additionally we could all be more sensitive about others predicaments. The trailers led people to think this film may be about \"body-shaming\", but it was more about finding confidence from within. The plot has issues due to some weak writing in the script. However, some of the dialogue is witty and fun. The story fits a romantic comedy conventions and is quite formulaic in it's approach to romance. The supporting cast is decent, but 95% of the laughs do come from Schumer's character. Michelle Williams does a fine job in her role. It is not the worst comedy in the world, but it isn't the worst one ever either. Overall, I give this film a 5/10."}
{"rating": "5", "date": ["21 April 2018"], "user_name": "Dave McClain", "user_id": "ur62963353", "title": "a respectable but muted nod to the undervalued", "content": "\"I Feel Pretty\" (PG-13, 1:50) is a comedy (with a good bit of drama and some fantasy mixed in) starring Amy Schumer as an insecure young woman who gets the chance to find out what it's like to live the life of a beautiful woman. The movie is co-written and co-directed by both Abby Kohn and Mark Silverstein.\nSchumer plays Renee Bennett, one of two workers in the online division of a fictional make-up company called Lili LeClaire. She works across from a skeezy co-worker named Mason (Adrian Martinez) in a small office under a Chinese restaurant. She dreams of working in the main office on Park Avenue - and being as beautiful as someone like Mallory (Emily Ratajkowski), another woman in her spin class. But alas, she feels stuck in her dead-end job, in her unremarkable overweight body, with all of her insecurities and practically invisible to everyone but her two best friends, Vivian (Aidy Bryant) and Jane (Busy Philipps).\nThen, one otherwise ordinary day (the night after watching \"Big\" on TV and then literally wishing for beauty as she throws coins in a fountain), as Renee is feeling especially inspired by the exuberant leader of her spin class, she gets a little too excited on her bike, falls off and her hits her head. When she comes to, she looks in the mirror and believes that she has suddenly become supermodel-beautiful. Renee practically explodes with excitement and triumphantly meets her confused friends in a bar, convinced they won't recognize her anymore and works hard to \"convince\" them that it's really her - Renee!!\nConvinced that she's now thin and beautiful, Renee suddenly has a confidence that has significant and immediate effects on her life - personally and professionally. In a dry cleaner's, she meets the kind but shy Ethan (Rory Scovel), who doesn't understand her apparently exaggerated confidence at first but soon starts dating her (which has repercussions for her relationship with Vivian and Jane). Renee also improbably gets a job in the Lily LeClaire headquarters, where her confidence and capabilities come to the attention of the beautiful, but insecure Avery LeClaire (Oscar nominee Michelle Williams), who is running the company for her kind, but demanding grandmother, founder Lily LeClaire (Lauren Hutton). \n\"I Feel Pretty\" is well-intentioned, but wholly predictable and only mildly entertaining. Its strength is its life-affirming, empowering and timely advocacy of self-worth and confidence in (and in spite of) the age of Facebook and Instagram, but it's only marginally effective in delivering that message. Based on the character and plot set-up in the previous paragraphs (assuming that this wouldn't be your first time seeing a movie), you can probably write the rest of the story in your head and be pretty accurate. Much of the supporting cast is bland in their roles (except for Williams who is game, but annoying in hers) and even Schumer's considerable comedic talents only give us an occasional chuckle. This movie is, at best, a respectable but muted nod to the undervalued. \"B-\""}

{"rating": "5", "date": ["21 April 2018"], "user_name": "hannahgrahambell", "user_id": "ur87608150", "title": "With low expectations, an enjoyable movie", "content": "I Feel Pretty leans with full confidence on its star, Amy Schumer, who carries most of the film's comedic and emotional weight. As a comedy, the movie is rarely laugh-out-loud funny, but Schumer's exuberance and talent will have audiences grinning throughout. None of the jokes are too crude or cruel, and the central conflict is never too dark to take the audience out of their pleasantly amused mood. \nIn terms of storytelling, the main lead Renee is the only fully developed character in the movie. Everyone else serves the tropes of the genre satisfactorily, but no one manages to steal the scenes from the star. At times, the beats that have to be hit feel like a drag, especially towards the end of the movie when the humor is sacrificed for message. However, one could hardly expect this movie to completely subvert chick-flick clich\u00e9s. At most, the expectation should be that a movie like I Feel Pretty uses the formula lightly. With this standard in mind, the movie more or less succeeds.\nThe message of the film, absolutely crucial to its success, in no way breaks new ground. The idea that inner beauty matters more than outer beauty is a hackneyed message, and the way the film addresses the issue is neither nuanced nor spectacular. But just because the moral and the medium used to tell it are simple, doesn't meant that it isn't a worthwhile message that can be entertaining in the hands of a talented comedian. If one goes into I Feel Pretty with tempered expectations, they will most likely have an enjoyable time."}

Granted, they were at 2.2 on Friday, so they've gone up since, but still. When I watched the movie it wasn't the greatest of all time, but it was a good movie with a powerful message that needed to be heard. This was the most real movie I've seen in a while and it was refreshing. I went in thinking 'I Feel Pretty' was going to be sheer comedy after watching the trailer, because that's how it was advertised. It had some laughable parts, but the sole focus of the film was not on humor, but on self love and the balance of it. What I mean by this is the movie started out with Amy Schumer being this timid, insecure woman who was afraid to live large. After she hit her head she thought she was someone else and started acting like it. At first it was a good thing, because her confidence was way up. But as this facade went on she began to get more conceited than confident. When she figured out she was the same woman the whole time she realized that it doesn't matter what you look like. You can do whatever you want if you set your mind to it and have some confidence. She figured out the balance of loving yourself. The beginning of the movie was at rock bottom of her self love, the middle was when she was at an unforeseen pinnacle of narcissism, and at the end she was content and confident with herself. I thought this movie carried a lot of weight and should be seen by every single woman in America."}

{"rating": null, "date": ["20 April 2018"], "user_name": "rgkarim", "user_id": "ur25226117", "title": "Pretty Life Lesson Wrapped In A Mundane Package", "content": "Comedy takes on many forms and faces, sometimes absurdly clever and other times simplistic slapstick meant to be over the top. It's a genre that offers the most variety, bringing many people into the theaters to make the movie-going experience fun. Given the volume of movies pumped out by the studios though, I find it hard to get stoked for movies that look questionable. So, tonight's review held much mystery as to what was in store. Nevertheless, Robbie K is back in action to share his thoughts as he reviews: \nFilm: I Feel Pretty\nDirectors:\n Abby Kohn, Marc Silverstein\nWriters:\n Abby Kohn, Marc Silverstein\nStars:\n Amy Schumer, Michelle Williams, Emily Ratajkowski \n\nLIKES: \nCute, Not Crude: Schumer's quality is usually how much vulgarity one can cram into a 2-hour film in hopes of bringing nonstop laughs. I Feel Pretty washes that crude nature away, focusing instead on a cuter movie that's more awkward than bluntly grotesque. Such a change was refreshing to see, and for once not too distracting from the story/morals of the film. \nOne component of the Story: I Feel Pretty's story is very basic, but one component in particular stands out and that is the lesson of inner beauty and self-confidence. Like a distorted version of Shallow Hal, the movie is designed to isolate the importance of believing in oneself and how one can succeed if done right. Yet go too far, and one crosses the line to arrogance, becoming the very thing they hated being judged by. These lessons were fun, structured, and in the final scene delivered well with writing that actually had fire, fury, and emotional punch to deliver the teachings they wanted to present. \nEthan: This comedy had me chuckling at times, often due to a well-placed quip, or awkward scenario playing out. Yet the most consistent source of laughs was Rory Scovel as Ethan. The male lead had in both my friend and I's opinions the best delivery of his lines, writing that was the least over the top, and reactions that were appropriate for the mess Schumer's character landed in. Even his nonverbal comedy hit the mark, the simplistic facial expressions enough to emphasize the shock factors this movie brings. In addition, Ethan was a major adorable factor for the relationship, grounding the ridiculousness the relationship held. \nDISLIKES: \nRather Bland: Surprisingly, the lack of crude comedy resulted in the movie feeling rather bland at times, almost like a forced, water downed version of usual style. The slower, lackadaisical parts were hard to keep my eyes open for, making the movie drag at parts that could have been left out. In addition, the lack of gimmicks that she is known to bring were quite absent in this movie, making this movie feel quite off for both my friend and me. So, don't expect to be in stitches the whole time in this film. \nRuined by Trailers: It happened again, despite the few times I saw this trailer, I hadn't expected practically all of the funny parts to be revealed in the movie. I Feel Pretty was sorely ruined by the trailer, leaving little sustenance in the actual movie itself aside from some cute romance, a few chuckle worthy moments, and of course some attractive models. \nOver the Top Comedy: While not cruse, I Feel Pretty still suffers from overusing comedic ploys as the sole means of laughing. The movie lacks much clever comedy, or even a dynamic array of comedy to mix things up, forcing one to sit through mindless banter, half-mumbled complaints, and dare I say boring dialogue for most of the movie. Even her drunk moments lack that bite to shake things up, again resorting to whiney, bouts of crying that did little to make us laugh. \nMessy Story: A strong message brings about a solid foundation to build a story upon, but again the movie got lazy, failing to expand beyond what was shown in the trailer. Character development is practically missing in this movie, lost to the mockery of inner beauty to outer beauty. Ethan may be sweet, but his history is a mystery, with little evolution past the quirky, heart of gold man ready to sweep in and start a relationship with the protagonist. As for the best friends, I can only laugh at the fact they were even introduced, for these women are practically absent during much of the film. And in regards to the impasse of work, even that was rather anticlimactic and weirder than anything else. The summary of this dislike, too many loose ends and lack of comedy to offset these weak story arcs. \n\nThe VERDICT: \nI Feel Pretty held so much potential, but once more the comedy realm has failed to expand upon gimmicks. The film holds an incredible moral lesson, and the final scene drops the hammer to shatter the glass of believing in oneself. That's it though, for the cute nature and the quirky relationship... this game just does nothing to help with the shortcoming of the film. It's bland, with over the top (stale) tactics doing little to correct the rather messy story. Throw in the trailers containing the gold nuggets buried deep in the movie, and you realize there is not much to warrant a trip to theater with this one. It's target audience is a girls' night out for a group looking to relate to a comedy. Otherwise you are just wasting your time. My scores are:\nComedy: 5.0\nMovie Overall: 3.0"}

A friend and I went to see it recently and honestly laughed all the way through the movie. It was truly a feel good movie to us. It has a good message of acceptance. Is it very deep? No, it is not but it does have a very good message of love yourself for who you are and you can be confident without being a super model type.\nIn the way our society has trended over the years to be as \"perfect\" as one can be to be accepted, this movie is a much needed relief in regard to this trend. The push to be model thin and fit, not to mention the need for rhinoplasty, breast implants, cheek implants, facelifts, lip fillers, porcelain veneers, modern hair cuts with the latest color trend, constantly manicured nails, etc. to achieve that perfection, is just TOO much these days for many. It seems to get worse each year instead of better. \nI honestly feel sorry for those who are young and did not grow up in an era where people were much more natural and beauty was not so contrived and pushed by society in such a profound way.I appreciate this movie in helping others to understand through its message that you do not have to be perfect to be valued and accepted.\nI highly recommend this movie."}

If you're a guy between the ages of 16 and 35, this movie is not targeted to you! It's for me, a \"middle aged\" woman. Sorry to break it to you, but some movies are made for us! And if you \"never\" liked Amy Schumer, you probably aren't going to like this movie because, shocker, it has Amy Schumer in it.\nI laughed a lot and so did the other people in the theater with me. And the message is wonderful - that confidence helps you accomplish your goals, so stop listening to that negative voice in your head. A very entertaining film with lots of fun cameos like Lauren Hutton and Naomi Campbell.\nWomen's comedies are held to an impossible standard! And to people who are complaining about the \"politics\" of this film, get outta here. Bridesmaids, the most lauded comedy of the 21st century, had some pretty messed up \"politics\" and that didn't stop people from plunking down their dollars. \nJust grab a sister or a friend and see this movie - you'll be glad you did!"}

I felt the reviews were no way reflective of the quality. \nThis was a very sweet story and extremely relatable for most women. This is definitely not the first movie with a storyline where the main character gets to experience life through a completely different perspective (big, shallow hal, 13 going on 30, Peggy Sue Got Married, freaky Friday, Can't buy me love, the wizard of oz..) but it still is fresh and brings something new to the table. \nShumer is extremely likeable and like Carrie Bradshaw the kind of woman most women would want as a best friend. She's fun, outgoing, hilarious and good natured. \nWill this movie win an academy award? No, but it's still imo very worthwhile and a lot of fun. Some have said that it's absurd that someone who looks like Shumer should feel so insecure. She's pretty and only a teeny bit heaver than the average person, but I think they're missing the point, which is that women are held up to an impossible unachievable standard that only a teeny tiny fraction of the population could ever acheive or maintain and then have massive industries who's entire existence depends on women feeling bad about their looks and therefore needing product to correct this. How someone sees themselves and what they believe about themselves will dramatically influence their life and how others behave towards them."}

The problem here is the whole thing is put on Schumer an everybody else in the movie is just nonexistent. \n\nA bump on the head at the gym, makes an insecure woman(Amy Schumer) thinks she has transformed into the beautiful woman ever, while the rest of the world sees her has she always was.\n\nI realize the film is basically trying to be like a reverse Shallow Hal(2001), and the message is the same, but Shallow Hal executed the premise a little better. Amy Schumer does ok what she was giving, but I never felt it went anywhere. And cringing in my seat just waiting for it to end."}

No real comedians even take Schumer seriously. You can say that I'm sexist and I kind of am when it comes to my comedy. Though I favor men as the greats I am still a fan of just about any female Saturday Night Live alumn along with Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Chelsea Peretti, and more but then again any female in the category above is significantly more funny.\nAs for \"I feel pretty\", \"Trainwreck\" was significantly more funny and I didn't particularly fancy that movie either though it was watchable. This movie was absurdly cliche and a third rate rip off of Shallow Hal, which wasn't that great itself(The most unwatchable Jack Black performance I've ever seen) but I guess ripping off crappy material is typical of Schumer. After all said and done this is just not a good movie, even my girlfriend who drug me out to watch it didn't like it which is great because there's a better chance she won't repeat her transgressions. 1 star, unwatchable cash grab with no real heart. \nI'd also like to point out that the majority of good ratings on here are clearly generic shills to drive up the rating, there's no real thought or explanation behind them besides \"I don't understand the hate\"."}

The only problem that I saw with it is that it's not funny, and of course that's a big problem when you are trying to make people laugh. The message about confidence in your self is not lost on me. I got the message in this movie's bastard cousin, Shallow Hal which starred Jack Black and came out almost two decades ago. Man! I Feel Pretty was desperately clawing its way to a laugh it could not get to. Too bad, caused I loved Trainwreck and Snatched, but I do see a pattern of Schumer's flicks getting weaker and weaker, and she needs to break the habit."}
