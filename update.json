Superman. It's funnier, it has more action, it has less brooding and darkness, and it's just plain much, much more fun to watch. Justice League is the kind of movie that should put DC back on the same sort of cinematic path that Marvel has been treading over the past decade.\nThe movie picks up where the aforementioned Batman v. Superman left off. Superman is gone, having sacrificed himself to save the world. Meanwhile, Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) begin to recruit an alliance of super-duper people (Flash (Ezra Miller), Cyborg (Ray Fisher), Aquaman (Jason Momoa)) to prepare for what appears to be another alien threat.\nThat alien threat is one Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds), the nephew and second-in-command to the yet-unseen super big bad named Darkseid. Steppenwolf has arrived on Earth to collect three Mother boxes \u2013 objects that, when joined together, will grant immense power, etc., etc., etc. Steppenwolf is aided by thousands and thousands of Parademons, bug-like creatures who were once men.\nHere's a brief list of what I liked about the movie. 1) Bruce Wayne has a wry, understated sense of humor that \u2013 get this \u2013 is also self-deprecating. 2) Jason Momoa kills as a manly-man king of the seas. 3) Gal Gadot is just as terrific as she was in her own movie and in BvS. 4) The Flash is hilarious! 5) There were plenty of tight action sequences that, despite being shown in IMAX, were easy to track. I could see who was fighting whom and with what! \nThe overall tone of the movie is more in line with what Marvel's doing \u2013 there's physical fighting, there are biting remarks, there are doubts (our heroes are human-ish, after all), there are touching moments. Everyone delivers, which isn't always the case in ensemble pictures, but Affleck in particular really stepped up his game as the Bat dude. A lot of people liked his performance in BvS, but I found him stiff and boring. That's just not true in Justice League. Bats still has a huge ego, still likes to run things, likes to work alone even among his team. And he's still kind of a jerk. But he's not a boring jerk; Affleck, finally, gives him a personality! And lo! DC was saved!"}

I don't mean that he plays a British man masquerading as a Japanese man, I mean that he's supposed to be the Japanese man in the first place. Alec Guinness \u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 was not Japanese and didn't even look vaguely Asian, and yet there he was anyway. Guinness accomplished his portrayal by kind of squinting, something that I think most of us in 2017 would see as pretty racist. Were there no suitable Japanese actors in 1961? Or even actors with any Asian heritage? Using Caucasian actors to play Asian roles was certainly much more common at that time than it is now. The sentiment on the part of the movie studios was that American audiences wouldn't go to see a movie headlined by an Asian star. Sadly, they were probably right.\nThe movie itself is a culture clash in which widowed Mr. Asano (Guinness) and widowed Mrs. Jacoby (Rosalind Russell) meet on a ship traveling from the U.S. to Tokyo. Mrs. Jacoby is Jewish and hasn't even left New York, and yet there she is, on a transcontinental voyage with her daughter and her son in law, the latter of whom has received a diplomatic posting to Japan amid some tense trade negotiations. Mrs. Jacoby is not a fan of the Japanese, as her only son was killed in WW II, which would have been fresh in the minds of the audience, having occurred less than two decades earlier. Her wariness of Asians in general and Japanese in particular would have been relatable for 1961 audiences. Not so much for us today.\nAs Mrs. Jacoby and Mr. Asano become more acquainted, they develop a positive relationship \u2013 which, ironically enough, threatens to upend the son-in-law's negotiations with the Japanese government regarding their trade policies. This leads to misunderstandings that, like any good sitcom, are resolved in all good time. But not without some feelings being hurt and some minds being changed.\nGuinness does his best to do the job he's given, but personally I couldn't look past the fact that this was a Caucasian man playing an Asian man (and not as a disguise, as Sean Connery's James Bond would do a few years later). Mr. Asano, as a result, feels like a caricature of what Hollywood must have felt Asians were like (or at least how Americans in general viewed Asians). To a lesser degree, Russell is also oddly cast \u2013 she, of Irish descent, playing an observing Jewish woman \u2013 but the stereotype isn't as stark as with Guinness's Asano. Russell, for her part, is entirely believable. (Look for Mae Questel as Jacoby's bigoted friend and George Takei as Asano's servant, too.) Finally, the movie is just too darn long. It's 2.5 hours! That's great for an action movie, maybe even a mystery, but not a romance drama that takes place in generally close quarters. The plot is simple enough, and the scenes set in Japan are exquisitely shot, but it's not enough to lift a movie that simply drags when it's not being outright offensive by modern standards."}

Armageddon! Sunday, Sunday, Sunday! In this movie, it's kind of like that, only it might also be a beginning. So zen. Whatever it means, Thor's third thrilling ride is a blast, with familiar and new characters zooming into view just long enough for us to pay a tiny bit of heed and move on. It's fast, not thickly plotted, and most importantly a lot of fun. More fun than The Dark World.\nPart of the reason is that Thor himself (Chris Hemsworth) smiles almost continuously throughout the movie. In previous Marvel films, Thor's been kind of serious, a more grounded counterweight to Tony Stark but not as angry as The Hulk. Here, he's both smart and giddy. And he has every reason to be giddy, because this is a fun movie, as so many Marvel films are.\nThor returns to Asgard with the horns of some demon who's kind of important to the story, but he discovers that Heimdel (Idris Elba) has been accused of treason and is in exile, that Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is using his powers of trickery to run things (including staging plays telling his tales of bravery), and that Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is actually on Midgard (aka Earth). Oh, and that Odin's actual eldest child, Hela (Cate Blanchett) has now escaped her own prison \u2013 where Odin placed her when she got particularly rambunctious \u2013 and wishes to initiate Ragnarok. Death to everyone! Thor's adventures in trying to save Asgard land him on a remote planet, though, imprisoned to fight as a gladiator at the pleasure of the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum), who's equal parts hilarious and brutal. And who's the grand champion in the arena? Why, none other than The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo)! Can Thor escape the Grandmaster, get back to Asgard, stop Ragnarok, defeat his older sister, and then drink some mead? Some of those, anyway! So why does this Thor work so well? Because it's HILARIOUS. It's less comic-book movie and more comedy. There's a buttload of comedy, which is a lot no matter how big of a butt we're talking about. Everyone is aces. Even Stan Lee (yes, of course he has a cameo). Director Taika Waititi (What We Do in the Shadows) essentially subverts the superhero film, taking on tropes, clich\u00e9s, you name it. It's not that Thor acts like an anti-hero (like Iron Man), it's that he appears to have fun saving the universe. It's a nice switch. And Thor: Ragnarok gleefully (and gracefully) sets up the next movie(s) in the endless franchise, so it's a virtually seamless fit into the vaunted Marvel Universe."}

This retelling of the events proved to be equal parts cringe-inducing and unsatisfying, although the use of home footage shot by the Friedman family itself is put to terrific use.\nArnold Friedman taught a computer class to local kids in his basement. He also taught piano and was considered a really good guy. He was married to Elaine Friedman, and they had three boys: David, Seth, and Jesse. At the time of the allegations, each son was a young adult. Jesse often assisted his father during the computer classes. But what tipped authorities off was that a magazine containing underage porn and addressed to Arnold Friedman, was intercepted as part of an ongoing operation. Investigators then delivered the magazine themselves (posing as postal employees) and showed up later in the day with a search warrant. Friedman thought they were after only the magazine, but the search warrant was for the entire house \u2013 and lo and behold, a huge trove of underage porn was discovered. This discovery led to officials interviewing various students from Arthur Friedman's computer classes, and their answers \u2013 and eventual testimony \u2013 led to charges being filed.\nThe film itself interviews the three sons and Elaine Friedman; Arnold Friedman died in prison. Other participants include psychologists, detectives, and even former students of Arnold Friedman. But what's most interesting is the interplay among the Friedman family members. While Arnold's (and Jesse's, as he too was swept up in the charges) court case was being played out and he was out on bail, his sons would argue at the dinner table about how best to combat the obviously false charges. But just as obvious was Elaine's silence \u2013 or at least the absence of her offering her own full-throated support. This was something that none of the sons appreciated, of course.\nI found the documentary to be fascinating but still troubling. We are presented with a lot of evidence that Arnold was a pedophile. We are presented with conflicting evidence that the kids in the computer class were molested by Arnold and/or Jesse. Huge questions are raised regarding the guilt borne by the Friedmans. I wanted to know more. Documentaries don't need to show bias in order to present a possible outcome. In other words, if the makers of this film felt that it was pretty clear that the crimes had been committed, then that would be the thesis of the movie; conversely, if they felt that either Jesse or Arnold didn't get a fair shake, that would also be a thesis.\nBut the film takes no stance either way, and we're left with a lot of maybes that don't add up to much. Only the home video shot by the family is compelling, showing as it does the internal struggles between full support of a family member despite the accusation of a vile crime and the withholding of that support because of that accusation. It's just not clear who to believe; the movie just presents details, and not enough for anyone to come down strongly on one side or the other of the issue."}

But this isn't a standard home-invasion flick, and she's not the standard victim, either. This Intruders contains a devilish twist about midway through, and suddenly this isn't a movie about a damsel in distress but something wholly different \u2013 and much more interesting.\nAnna (Riesgraf) lives in an old house with her brother Conrad, who's quickly dying of some disease. The two have lived in the house by themselves since their father passed away some ten years earlier, but Anna has developed a paralyzing fear of the outside. She can't even open the door without hyperventilating.\nConrad dies very early in the film. The only other person Anna has been in contact with over the past decade has been the faithful delivery boy from Meals on Wheels, Dan (Rory Culkin). A few days before Conrad's death, Dan and Anna discuss the possibility of either leaving their small town for bigger and better things. When Dan says he'd love to strike out on his own somewhere, Anna offers him a sackful of cash. Which Dan turns down.\nA quick fast-forward to the days after Conrad's death. It's time for the funeral. Anna doesn't go, despite the pleadings of her brother's lawyer. And then, while she's at home doing pretty much nothing, a couple of vehicles pull up in her driveway and men enter the house. They don't know she's there. Because she's not supposed to be there.\nRiesgraf's Anna is no shrinking violet. At the same time, the thugs aren't exactly one dimensional themselves, with each character carefully defined without being a stereotype. Perhaps this affair won't be as one sided as it initially appeared. After all, this is Anna's home turf.\nI found Intruders to be fairly brilliant, with a neat twist on a standard plot that ultimately transforms the film from a pile of predictability to a tsunami of terror and guessing."}

But that covers only about the first twenty minutes of this gory thriller. Then stuff gets weird.\nFirst, a disclaimer. As I was watching this movie, I realized I really didn't like it. I just didn't get it. Didn't know why the plot was moving forward. Wasn't the revenge over? And then the third act finally arrived. And when I went to bed, I still didn't like it, but I was wavering. When I woke up the next morning, I had to admit to myself that it was a pretty good movie after all.\nIn a sense, the plot isn't quite linear. We first see the women getting the revenge. But then the focus shifts from the original victim, Lucie (Mylene Jampanoi), to her friend Anna (Morjana Alaoui), who herself becomes a victim of immeasurable suffering. It's like watching the events that probably happened to Lucie play out with Anna. I started to wonder what the point or the endgame was. Was this just for the sake of bloodletting? The answer lies in the title. I certainly can't tell you why, as that would spoil the surprise.

I guess I had it in my head that it would be more of a new-wave feminist take on the original plot, but I found the movie \u2013 despite strong performances \u2013 to be tedious and frustrating to watch. It's a shame; a lot of talent was wasted on both sides of the camera.\nNicole Kidman plays Miss Martha, the headmistress at a girls' school in Virginia in the middle of the Civil War. One of her charges, searching for mushrooms for dinner, comes across a Union soldier named Corporal McBurney (Colin Farrell), who's badly wounded. Miss Martha agrees to take in the Yankee \u2013 they're in the middle of Confederate territory \u2013 give him medical attention, and allow him to convalesce at the school. The young corporal is charming and graceful, and the ladies know that if they return him to the woods, he wouldn't last long. And if they waited until their own troops stopped by, they might want to take McBurney with them before his leg has healed.\nIt doesn't take long for McBurney to win the hearts and minds of the lasses, which include teacher Edwina (Kirsten Dunst) and student Alicia (Elle Fanning). Each lady has designs of some sort on their new guest, but who's playing whom? I haven't seen the Eastwood film, so I didn't know how this one was going to play out \u2013 until less than halfway through, when I got a pretty good idea. McBurney doesn't actively play each woman against the others, but his manipulations aren't exactly subtle, either. Farrell does a fine job, but it really feels like ages go by before anything beyond passing character interactions develops \u2013 and even then, the focus is mainly on Martha and Edwina. There's little action to speak of and even less suspense. The result is a movie that feels amorphous, even useless."}

I know this only because I looked it up. Prior to adding it to my Netflix queue a short while back, I had never heard of the movie. And I wish I had! It's gross, unsettling, weird, and funny. Those are all qualities I look for in a horror film.\nThe titular May (Angela Bettis) is an odd young lady who works as a veterinarian's assistant. She has a lazy eye that's mostly corrected by glasses and, later, contacts. And she also has an old doll in a glass case, a doll given to her by her mother when May was just a little girl who had just injured her subsequently lazy eye. That's quite a present, huh, a doll that you're not allowed to take out of the box.\nBut fret not, viewers, this isn't about a possessed doll. It's about May, who's just plain not all there. May's coworker at the vet clinic is Polly (Anna Faris), who has intentions of her own with May. Meanwhile, May spots a mechanic she'd like to get more familiar with, Adam (Jeremy Sisto). But, you know, she's socially awkward and has no concept of personal space. So when her brief relationship with Adam ends and she runs into trust issues with Polly and her family-heirloom doll (made by mom, by the way) is irreparably damaged, May turns to her sewing skills to make do. Blood is then spilled.\nLove the acting. Bettis is essentially a grown-up Wednesday Addams (complete with an overabundance of forehead), and she embodies May with both innocence and a sort of civil evilness. Faris is stunning \u2013 and outstanding \u2013 as the promiscuous, amoral, and flighty Polly. Might be the best role Faris has ever had. And Sisto, looking a heck of a lot like a twentysomething John Travolta, also holds his own.\nI kind of think that if you like movies such as Re-Animator and Dead Alive, you'll go for this one as well. Seems like it should be better known, but it was sure new to me."}

And Jason Statham is in it! But that's not really what I got. Instead, this is more of a psychological thriller, and that's not Ritchie's forte. There are more minds being blown than there are heads being blown off, that much I can tell you. Which made this movie a bit of a disappointment to me.\nStatham plays Jake Green, a gambler just out of jail after seven years. Soon after his release, he's winning games of chance left and right. Which doesn't sit will with his nemesis, one Dorothy (!) Macha (Ray Liotta), who owns the casino where Jake's winning his winnings. When Macha's goons go after Jake, he receives some unexpected help from a couple of strangers \u2013 the suave Avi (Andre Benjamin) and the burly Zach (Vincent Pastore). They'll keep Macha's hounds at bay, for a price \u2013 all of Jake's money and his willing participation in their own loan-sharking racket.\nThis still sounds like a fun movie. And let's not forget, \"revolver\" is right there in the title, too. But as the story progresses, it becomes less and less about feuding and fussing and fighting than about mind games. Who are Zach and Avi? Is Macha insane? Why won't these people just shoot each other? The body count is way too low for this sort of genre thriller. Heck, after a while I began questioning my own eyes. Was Jake actually hallucinating the whole thing? Maybe Jake wasn't real, either. Maybe I was the one hallucinating! Maybe I'm in Purgatory, endlessly watching the same boring Guy Ritchie movie. It's not quite Hell \u2013 that'd be watching any Uwe Boll movie on a loop \u2013 but it feels just as tedious.\nRevolver seems like a baffling foray into a theater of the absurd for a director who's not known for overly cerebral flourishes in his work. That's not to say that Ritchie's earlier films are for dummies only \u2013 they're fun, visceral treats, for the most part, and a lot of fun. But this one? This one was dull and inscrutable. The novelty of seeing Jason Statham with hair wore off rather quickly, although he's just as good in this movie as he is in almost any other movie (except maybe Spy, where he was hilariously good). Liotta is an unhinged menace, as he typically is. It was nice to see Vincent Pastore playing someone who's not a low-level organized-crime fall guy, though. And Andre Benjamin is smooth. But no, and I fully intend this pun, Revolver is a misfire."}

So, despite Justin's wishes, the two do in fact return to the compound they left a decade earlier. But why are they being summoned back? Are their lives (again) in danger? Or has the cult changed into just being another Northern California commune? When the brothers arrive in the middle of nowhere, they find the de facto leader Hal (Tate Ellington), who explains that the group has prospered in the years since Aaron and Justin left. Their primary source of income? Homemade beer. Very hipster. The members of the small commune/cult each have their own special skill, whether it's painting, knitting, magic tricks. The list is pretty finite, actually.\nBut it isn't too long before things get a little unsettling. No spoilers here; the cult believes there is an all-powerful deity who exists only for them \u2013 i.e., not a God from any other religion. This entity sends the group messages via cassette tapes and Polaroid photos. The group members pass this all off as normal; to be truthful, I found their happiness to be a bit unsettling. But Aaron, the younger/more impressionable of the brothers, wants to believe and is definitely looking for some structure in his life after a decade of menial jobs and no real direction. His wiser brother Justin, is strongly skeptical, but certain events do make him question his own sense of righteousness.\nSo this seems like a pretty straightforward story, doesn't it? Maybe there's something to the cult's thinking, maybe they're really just harmlessly living off the grid. But then a few somethings happen, and the movie switches from being about a crazed cult into being about, well, the neverending loop of reality. And that's when the movie really takes off. I'm talking about mindbending twists and some terrific special effects. Just like that, the plot zooms from just sort of floating about, intriguing but not enticing, and then it blasts into overdrive. And suddenly nothing makes sense, and everything makes sense. It's a huge trip.\nFor that reason, I really enjoyed this movie, the third I saw at this year's Spooky Movie International Film Festival in Silver Spring, Maryland. The Endless was written by Benson and directed by Benson and Moorhead, and they score with all aspects of their work here. If you're looking for a distorted-reality movie, check out The Endless."}

It's a movie chock full of atmosphere and unease, and it's really well done. Good movie for this time of year.\nKilmer plays Hall Baltimore. He drinks a lot. I mean a lot. At a quiet book signing, the local sheriff Bobby Lagrange (played with absolute zeal by Bruce Dern) slyly mentions that he himself is a bit of a writer and would Mr. Baltimore care to collaborate? Why, Sheriff Bobby even has a story all ready to go. Has to do with missing and/or murdered kids, or maybe the aforementioned belfry (it's haunted!) and probably everything to do with those kids who live across the lake, the ones who look like they practice Satanism or some such.\nMeanwhile, Baltimore has money woes. His wife (played by Kilmer's real-life ex, Joanne Whalley) pressures him to get another advance from his publisher (David Paymer) so that she can pay off their mounting debt, even threatening to sell his priceless copy of Whitman's Leaves of Grass. This is kind of what gets Baltimore to agree to a sort of collaboration with the sheriff.\nOne night, Baltimore has one heck of a dream.

The girl refuses to go in; Baltimore does, and he learns some things about missing children and the secrets of the town. He wakes up. But was it a dream? Coppola strikes just the right tone with this movie, and the casting is superlative. Kilmer is fine - perhaps even better than usual - and Dern is terrific. Love that guy. Alden Ehrenreich (the new Han Solo, plus the guy from Beautiful Creatures) and Don Novello (yes, Father Guido Sarducci from SNL) are both a real treat.

But overall, it's vicious in its profile of the human spirit and the evil that men do when confronted with a moral quandary that has no positive outcome.\nThe Belko Corporation is headquartered in a high rise outside of Bogota, Colombia. It's not clear what they do, but everyone dresses in business attire, so it must be something important. On this particular day, security seems to be even tighter than usual, with local soldiers asking employees for ID and with temporary workers being unexpectedly turned away.\nWe meet some of the staff. Mike (John Gallagher, Jr.), an exec; his love interest Leandra (Adria Arjona), the creepy Wendell (John C. McGinley), and the big boss, Barry (Tony Goldwyn), plus many others. Looks like a humdrum day for office drones. That is, until all of the windows - and door - are suddenly covered by thick metallic barriers, and a voice comes over the PA system. The voice tells staff that in thirty minutes, they - the staff - must kill two people, or else more will be killed. Some believe the incident to be one big joke, but about 30 minutes in, the backs of some people's heads explode. No, not snipers. You see, every employee at Belko has a chip in the back of their head. Because it's Colombia, you see, and there are always kidnappings (particularly of foreign nationals). Just a way for the fine folks at Belko to keep track of you, should you go missing. But, as you've probably guessed, those chips are actually explosives, and that's how we know the baddies are serious.\nChaos reigns for much of the rest of the film, as people realize there's no way out of their predicament. A couple of camps emerge, one that wants to kill fellow staff so that they themselves can live, and another that wants no part of the killing. Man versus fellow man. Who will prevail? Probably not man.\nFor the most part, this is a fine movie. Maybe not one you want to think about too much, but then again there's not much to think about. We know only enough about the characters to kind of care about their fates. And, for the most part, we don't know anything about the forces outside the building. True, the internal conflict is what drives the movie, but perhaps a little more about why this is the case would have been helpful. The performances are good, but not exceptional."}

Hard to believe this is the 12th year of the festival, which features a plethora of relatively new scary films each year \u2013 along with one or two older classics as well.\nOpening the scares this year was Better Watch Out, directed by Chris Peckover and starring Olivia DeJonge (The Visit) as a babysitter watching a precocious 12-year-old named Luke (Levi Miller) while his parents (Virginia Madsen and Patrick Warburton) enjoy a night out of the house. Babysitter Ashley quickly finds herself in for more than just a night on the couch watching movies, as she has to deal with her young charge \u2013 who has long had a crush on his sitter \u2013 and then a home invasion.\nBut this ain't no ordinary home invasion. I can't tell you all more than that. I wish I could, but I really want you to watch this movie, and telling you more of the story would ruin the experience for you. There are a lot of surprises in this movie. Plenty of plausible but unpredictable twists. The movie is tightly plotted (by Peckover and Zack Kahn).\nThe performances are phenomenal, especially considering the ages and relative lack of experience of the leads. Miller, in particular, is a wonder to behold; his Luke shifts tone rather dramatically over the course of the movie, but his skills make the shift utterly believable and magical. There aren't many adult actors who could pull off the characterization that Levi Miller does in this film.\nCome for the intrigue of a vulnerable babysitter protecting her young charge but stay when that trope is turned completely upside down."}

At least that one aspect of the story. The young woman also has short-term memory loss and slight moments of distorted reality. She meets strangers who say they've already met, including a skin specialist. Is she going nuts? Or is she already there? Let me back up. When we first meet Kira, she's heading to the apartment of a man she met at a bar. They laugh, they flirt, she spends the night. When she wakes up, he's gone, and the skin condition appears. She tries scratching it and picking at it, as one is wont to do, which only makes matters worse. She visits a dermatologist (Barbara Crampton) who prescribes some medication \"for the pain.\" But Kira discovers something really wacked, and completely by accident. She learns that if she peels off some affected skin and then applies someone else's skin to that spot, the new skin will adhere immediately to her body. This contradicts known medicine, as skin grafts can be a very lengthy and painful process. Has she found a cure for her malady? Lest one think this is just about a woman and her need for some good lotion, there's a mindbending twist, a psychological smack in the head for the viewer. It's too wonderful to explicate here, but in the great tradition of these thrillers, not all is what it seems. In fact, little is.\nThe final twist is perfect. Enough pieces fall into place that Kira's situation makes some sense, although not every question is answered neatly. The script is well written (by Norbert Keil and Richard Stanley), and Forsythe, Crampton, and Lucie Aron (as Kira's neighbor) turn in strong performances. Well made all around."}

Even if his heyday was a good half-century ago, his actions during one of Hollywood's very darkest periods still have tremendous impact even today. Especially today, for that matter.\nSome quick background. You may recall that in World War II, the US and the Soviets were allies but that after the war we became distrustful adversaries. This time was known as the Cold War \u2013 since the two countries didn't fight one another \u2013 and really ended only in the late 1980s. Prior to the end of WW II, many Americans joined the Communist Party as a way to fight the rise of Fascism in Europe. After the war, current and former members of the Party were looked upon as pariahs of the highest order. Screenwriter Dalton Trumbo (Bryan Cranston) was one of these pariahs. It didn't help that he actively tried to rally technical workers on film sets (grips, lighting and sound technicians) to strike for higher pay. Unionizing was seen as a bad thing, despite the gains it had achieved for American workers earlier in the century.\nTrumbo's membership in the Party wasn't a big deal at first, but then gossip columnist Hedda Hopper (Helen Mirren), who wielded an enormous amount of power in Hollywood, took it as a personal affront and used her column (and weekly appearance in newsreels) to denounce Communism in general and Trumbo in particular. Kicking the whole scandal into high gear was a little-known congressional group \u2013 the House Un-American Activities Committee. These guys tried to rout out Commies from Hollywood (which it saw as holding a lot of sway over Americans, much more so than today) by calling a group of known or suspected Communists to Washington for sworn testimony. These men were known as the Hollywood Ten. Trumbo was one of them, and he refused to tell the committee the names of anyone else who was or who could be a Communist. He, like his fellow Ten members, was found in contempt. Later, someone not in the group did name Trumbo, and he was put in prison for a full year.\nWhen he got out, no one would hire him (or any of the others in the Ten). Except for King Brothers Studio, which couldn't pay him much. But Trumbo worked fast as both a writer of original stuff and a fixer of existing scripts. The Kings loved him. So much so that the others in the Ten were offered jobs (for no credit, same as Trumbo) working as script doctors. During this time, Trumbo also got work from some friendly sorts in the business by selling them a script but not taking on-screen credit; the credit typically went to a fictitious person, or to a willing accomplice \u2013 known as a front. Through this method, Trumbo won two writing Oscars \u2013 although no one knew it at the time.\nDalton Trumbo fought for himself, his fellow writers, and for anyone for whom the Bill of Rights holds any meaning. He reasoned that if people could be silenced for political beliefs, then anyone could be silenced for any reason. This is, unfortunately, still true today. And although he didn't receive credit at the time, Trumbo was awarded his Oscars eventually (one posthumously). He's recognized as being one of the very greatest screenwriters the world has ever known. The movie does a terrific job describing Trumbo's struggles \u2013 and that of his family: his wife Cleo (Diane Lane) and his three doting children. The toll that his stance took on them was noticeable to everyone except for Trumbo himself.\nCranston turns in what was an Oscar-nominated performance, but his was not the only one of note. Lane is superb as his suffering, strong better half. Elle Fanning, as his eldest daughter, is also a standout, as are John Goodman (as Frank King) and Alan Tudyk (as writer Ian McLellan Hunter). Spellbinding from start to finish, and all screenwriters owe Trumbo a huge debt of gratitude for his long struggle on their behalf."}

Find characters with whom your audience can identify (and hopefully root for) and put them in a situation that's plausible yet unique. We've all seen haunted-house movies, or possession movies. And now we have a chilling (HAHA) tale of three friends stranded atop a ski lift with no help in sight.\nParker (Emma Bell), Joe (Shawn Ashmore), and Dan (Kevin Zegers) are pals. Dan and Parker are a couple; Joe and Dan are best friends. Joe and Dan do this ski trip every year, and now Dan's girlfriend Parker is along. Tension much? The trio doesn't have money for lift tickets, so their plan \u2013 a usual plan for Dan and Joe \u2013 is to bribe the person running the lift. $50, $100, it's still cheaper than lift tickets. In the past, this person has been a girl, and Dan and Joe have used their charms with much success. This time, it's a guy, so it's poor Parker who has to use her wiles (and Dan's money) to get them up the mountain. The plan works, and the trio spend the day zipping up and down the mountain on snowboards. Near the end of the day, they decide to make one more run (especially since they've been on bunny slopes, thanks to Parker's inexperience). They manage to get on the lift for the last trip up, but \u2013 thanks to a staff miscommunication \u2013 the lift is shut down while they're still on their way up. They're stuck in a small chair, many feet above the ground, and it's freezing out.\nSo there's your plausible situation. You can see this happening. The reason they're stuck up there isn't inconceivable. Their zest for another run isn't, either. And how many horror movies are set on a ski slope? Not too many.\nSurvival becomes key. For my money, though, it takes them far too long to realize that help's not on the way. With the temperature plummeting, every minute counts. And once they delay that decision, they become too cold to think clearly. This leads to a series of choices with tragic consequences.\nI would have liked this movie a bit more if the characters hadn't been, well, jerks. Look, I get that they can't afford the pricey lift tickets, but I'd be more sympathetic if they were trying to get something they really needed, like food. It's skiing (or snowboarding). If they can't afford the activity, they probably shouldn't be doing it. Dan, in particular, comes off as pretentious and condescending and \u2013 worse of all \u2013 boring. Don't know if I can blame the actor for this entirely, but the performance wasn't one to write home about.\nThe film looks good, with some terrific shots of the mountain, the silent and deserted lift, and the terrifying wolves who linger below. There's plenty of tension. I'm just not sure that the cast was up to the task.\nFrozen \u2013 with no musical interludes \u2013 is a mild disappointment."}

In other words, it's a satisfying horror movie as long as one doesn't hold it to the original's high standards.\nIf you haven't seen the original, here's how it breaks down. Family moves into a new house in suburbia, a mom (Rosemarie DeWitt), a dad (Sam Rockwell), teenage daughter, younger daughter, young son. Strange things begin to happen, as they do in these movies. The young daughter disappears, but she seems to be trapped in the television by malevolent spirits. The family contacts a specialist (the great Zelda Rubenstein in the original, Jared Harris here) to help them out.\nThis is not a shot-for-shot remake, and for that we should all be thankful. The parents aren't pot-smoking ne'er-do-wells; dad's just been laid off, and mom's a writer. (Which makes me wonder how they can afford the new house, but hey, I think maybe the fact that there are malevolent spirits has something to do with it.) Gone are scenes like the medium's assistant tearing his face off in the bathroom or all of the kitchen chairs suddenly appearing on top of the kitchen table. There's other, new stuff. It's kind of fun.\nThe movie doesn't break any new ground, though. 35 years have gone by here in the real world, and the effects \u2013 though frightening at times \u2013 aren't going to bowl you over. The acting is actually pretty good here, particularly by DeWitt, Harris, and Jane Adams. Even the kids are good, and of course the little darlin' who gets sucked into the other world is adorable as can be. Only Rockwell seems miscast. He's best at quirky, offbeat roles, not man-of-the-house roles. This was more of a role for a Greg Kinnear.\nSo while this Poltergeist remake didn't enthrall me, I found it tolerable for a rental. Kind of glad I did not see it in the theater, and the effects still looked good on my TV at home."}

In particular, he was an informant for Agent John Connolly \u2013 although the usefulness of Bulger's intel was often in dispute \u2013 all the while continuing his violent rampage over the city against anyone who would stand in his way.\nThe ruthless Bulger is played in Black Mass by Johnny Depp, an actor not really among the first who come to mind when the character of a crime lord is brought up. Depp has long been known for looking the part in each of his disparate roles and avoiding typecasting. But in Black Mass, even though he doesn't look like an Irish mobster \u2013 he completely embodies one. It's really his finest work, and that's saying something.\nThe movie is told in flashback, as a member of Bulger's inner circle recounts the whole sordid deal to another FBI agent, including the involvement of Connolly (Joel Edgerton) as well as Bulger's brother, state senator Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch). The brutality of Bulger's day-to-day existence isn't tempered; men and women are killed or maimed or harassed for seemingly benign reasons. There seemed to be no middle ground for Bulger. He liked you, you lived. He didn't, you didn't. The movie covers his feud against his Italian rivals in Boston, the Angiulo family, as well as his foray into the high-stakes world of betting on jai-alai in Miami. And how did Bulger get away with so much? Mostly through the protection of Connolly, who used Bulger's (scant) information to further his own career. Crooks protecting crooks. The rabbit hole is deep indeed.\nBut man, is Depp ever great. I stopped thinking of him as Johnny Depp soon after the movie began. It's funny \u2013 to look at Bulger in this movie, you probably wouldn't take him for a mob guy. He's wiry, he's balding, he wears glasses. Nothing tough leaps out at you. But the ferocity of Depp's exceptional performance puts that notion to rest. Cumberbatch, as his brother and fellow Boston native, is also very good and with a surprisingly believable accent. Kevin Bacon shows up as an FBI guy; I think this was his third go-around as a Boston-based law-enforcement officer."}

It's a toy that's as attractive to adults as it is to kids, and it doesn't show signs of slowing down.\nNow, when I was growing up, there weren't very many LEGO sets. The space one was considered a Big Deal around my house. The LEGO guy had an astronaut helmet! And there were all kinds of pieces you could use to build a wacky spaceship, directions be darned. In fact, I don't remember ever following directions for a LEGO set. We'd just pick up pieces and see what happened. Nowadays, though, there are thousands of themed sets, from Harry Potter and Star Wars to the old classics like pirate ships or the aforementioned astronauts. And with the huge success of The LEGO Movie, The LEGO Batman Movie, and the LEGO Ninjago Movie, it's hard to see the product's popularly dwindling anytime soon.\nThis documentary touches on everything LEGO, from its old-timey beginnings as an amusing pastime for the kiddies to the marketing behemoth it's become. We learn how LEGOs are used in a New Jersey school to help autistic children communicate. We learn that people have used LEGOs to make actual, usable, real life things like houses and cars. We learn that LEGO can even be used as an art medium. We learn, too, that the LEGO company itself evolved from being a typical create-from-within corporation to one that gladly welcomes the ideas and visions of its customers, even holding contests to get new ideas for LEGO products.\nThis Brickumentary is a fine film. There are plenty of human-interest stories, as one might expect, and more than one will jerk at the ol' heart strings. And, as noted above, there are also several real-world applications on display. When's the last time you saw a toy being used by adults to produce practical results? Probably half past never! Sure, it's a huge commercial.

Then bad guys, led by Richard Thompkins (Alex Rocco), try to get Tim to join them in capturing as many snakes as they can \u2013 because Tim's a great snake tracker, of course \u2013 in order to turn them into belts and shoes. Ah, the 1970s! Tim will have none of that and prefers to watch over his pets instead. (He doesn't even want to return to his tribe's reservation for their big dance! He's committed to living the hermit life.) Stanley is a recent father, so there are some little snakelings shimmying about in Tim's shack. When the bad guy's goons come back and attack Tim, Stanley leaps (sort of!) to his defense! Truly, this is just a classic tale of a boy and his snakes. Lots and lots of snakes. It is not a spoiler to note that Tim uses Stanley (and other snakes) to take care of those who have wronged him in this movie, which is essentially every other human character. Stanley (the movie) was released not too long after Willard, the one about a boy and his rat. See the theme? Well, cashing in on the weird-pet craze didn't quite work out, but you got to give the filmmakers credit for giving it the old college try.

Why, he knows the swamps and he knows his snakes. Go, Tim! Anyway, this nature-centric pic is pretty standard for the early 1970s, as an ecology craze was sweeping the nation's colleges. Still, it's not a good movie. Robinson's a little weak, the direction even weaker. Rocco is really the only standout, plus those snakes."}

(It's explained later.) Together, the team fights the ever-invading forces of Garmadon (Justin Theroux). The name of the city Garmadon wants to conquer is Ninjago, which looks like it should be pronounced like \"Ninja Go!\" but really is pronounced with the emphasis on the middle syllable: \"NinJAgo.\" Anyway, the big secret that Lloyd and the gang hide, aside from their real-life identities as high school students, is that Green Ninja is \u2013 dun dun DUN \u2013 the son of Garmadon. Lloyd the teenager, on the other hand, is well known as the warlord's kid, and man does he bear the brunt of their ire. Kids sit on the opposite side of the bus from him. People boo him. He just has to deal, because it's what being a kid is all about, right? Now Lloyd, being a teenager, is just slightly resentful that he has had an absentee dad, so after one of the many battles with Garmadon, he takes things personal and unleashes holy heck on his nemesis. Oh, I should mention that although each of them calls himself a ninja, they're just kids in mech suits. Totally not ninja like at all. This leads to Garmadon coming back with a vengeance, and\u0085well, I think you get the idea. Someone is going to learn a Very Important Lesson here.\nAnd if that were all that was to this movie, I'd say let's leave it to the kids and never watch it, fellow grownups! But the movie does inherit a bit of the sly humor from its predecessors. Remember how, when guns were fired in The LEGO Movie, the characters would make \"pew pew pew\" sounds? During one long battle scene, Garmadon actually fires sharks from (presumably) a shark cannon, and each time a shark is shot one hears \"dun dun dun\" aka the theme from Jaws. Later on, a bigger enemy is revealed, one that dwarfs Garmadon in destructiveness \u2013 a tabby. As in a real cat. If you've ever wanted to see a cat demolish LEGOs that you didn't have to pick up, now's your chance.\nI found a lot of The LEGO Ninjago Movie to be entertaining.

This success is despite the relentless stress of having divorced/estranged parents, an ex-husband, two children, and her grandmother all living under her roof and each with his or her own selfish peculiarities. Well, maybe not kindly grandma, who narrates the story.\nSee, first there's dad Rudy (Robert DeNiro), who's just been kicked out of his current wife's (or girlfriend's, not sure) house \u2013 \"I'm done with him \u2013 you can have him back\" \u2013 and who owns and operates a repair shop that happens to have a gun range. Rudy's the sort of guy who rubs just about everyone the wrong way, but of course Joy puts up with his shenanigans. Then there's mom Terry (an unrecognizable Virginia Madsen), who spends almost all of her time in her room watching her stories and flushing her hair down the toilet, which inevitably clogs. There's passionate ex Tony (Edgar Ramirez), who has a good heart if a lack of direction and who lives in the basement. And there's grandmother Mimi (Diane Ladd), who seems to be the only sensible, nurturing person in the house. There's also Joy's half-sister Peggy (Elisabeth Rohm), who doesn't live on the premises but may as well \u2013 and she herself has sort of a passive-aggressive love-hate relationship with the ironically named Joy.\nAggravating family aside, Joy \u2013 a longtime lover of creating things \u2013 stumbles upon the need for the aforementioned mop. Up until then, mop heads were permanently attached to the mop handle and couldn't be cleaned without the user touching the nasty thing. Joy discovers that winding a single strand of wool hundreds of times around a base, the mop head not only becomes more absorbent it also becomes easily detached. One can put it in the washing machine! One won't need to buy a new mop every few months! This discovery leads to much success and with it the downsides of running a business \u2013 particularly when the business involves your quirky family as well as Dad's new girlfriend, Trudy (Isabella Rossellini), who invests heavily in Joy's venture. Lot of people to please. Lot of potential for things to go wrong, too, when one is a novice in the world of business.\n(I don't even want to get into Bradley Cooper's character, the head of programming at QVC. Cooper is a little too subtle in his role, almost the point of invisibility. Talk about underwhelming.) Okay, enough plot exposition. Lawrence is winning as always and, in fact, elevates her character with more sincerity and moxie than the script allows. But she's about the only actor who does a lot with flimsy material. DeNiro's character is overbearing and obnoxious; Rossellini's even more so. Joy's rotten half-sister comes off as devious, resentful, and despicable, but prior to Joy's success there was no hint of acrimony. I get it, she's jealous of the success, but there's nothing to back up the attitude. Those characters all feel like they should be in a much broader film, not a character study. In other words, the tone adopted by them is at odds with that adopted by Joy; the two types clash, rather than contrast.\nJoy is a sufficiently entertaining movie, and it's almost entirely due to Lawrence's strong performance. Director David O. Russell, who also co-wrote the script, has done better."}

Cool, a prehistoric creature eating innocent boaters! The movie was terrible. Well, except for Betty White, who was feeding said creature. Definitely a movie in which you rooted for the bad guy. Rogue is similar, except there's no Betty White and it's set in Australia's Northern Territory, where cell phone signals and tourists both go to die.\nIn Rogue, Radha Mitchell (Silent Hill) plays a guide who gives tourists a close-up look at crocodiles. She pilots a fairly small boat down a pretty river, which I found odd if only because it was immediately followed by a much-larger tour boat that was subsequently not seen again. Guess that was the first-class section. Anyway, there's a mildly interesting group aboard her vessel, and one of them notices a signal flare. Well, with radio coverage kind of spotty, our guide (instead of heading back, as originally intended) heads upriver to search for those in distress. They find an small overturned watercraft. Moments later, something enormous smacks into the bottom of their own boat, causing the motor to malfunction, which causes the boat to ram into the nearest tiny island, whereupon everyone gets out.\nTurns out it's an island made mostly of mud and also that the tide is quickly rising. Our castaways need to find a way off that doesn't involve being eaten! And it also turns out that that's not very easy to do. A version of Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None plays out, except for the \"none\" part. The predicted ending occurs, although there are hiccups along the way. Michael Vartan (\"Alias\") plays a travel writer among the passengers, and Sam Worthington (Avatar) is an obnoxious ex of Mitchell's character.\nBut no, it's not a terribly good movie, although everyone does try hard. I lost track of how many times I heard \"stay away from the water!\" as if everyone didn't already know there were huge crocodiles in said water. The plot stretches credulity, but I had a feeling the filmmakers weren't going for realism here. A big plus \u2013 the scenery. No, not of the rugged Northern Territory but of a man-man lake in Victoria. Still Australia, though."}

He's also out to possibly save his people, as the appearance of the demonic boar portends grave consequences for the village \u2013 the gods and demons are reclaiming the forest.\nAshitaka attempts to buy some food in a neighboring town with a gold nugget, but the shopkeepers do not quite believe that the nugget is a valid form of currency. Our fair prince is saved from further embarrassment by a monk named Jigo (Billy Bob Thornton), who offers his assistance to Ashitaka. Ashitaka learns from Jigo of a town called (in the English version, anyway) Iron Town, since they mine iron. Jigo also mentions that the forest gods still dwell around Iron Town, a fact that is certainly not lost on Ashitaka. He heads out the next morning.\nMeanwhile, a long column of men and oxen, carrying rice back to Iron Town to feed the denizens, is attacked by two giant wolves \u2013 one of whom bears a masked girl. Leading the men is Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver), who orders her men to fire their brand-new muskets at the wolves. The wolves are driven off, but their mama, named Moro (Gillian Anderson) soon arrives and lays everyone to waste. Half of Lady Eboshi's men fall off the mountainside.\nFurther down the mountain, Ashitaka hears the battle above and comes across two men in the river. He pulls them out (one unconscious, the other with a broken arm) and carries them both through the ancient forest to Iron Town. On the way to Iron Town, Ashitaka encounters the wolves and the girl by the river side. The girl is San, the Princess Mononoke, i.e., the Angry Princess. Why is she so angry? Because Lady Eboshi has been killing all of the animals, which has been causing the forest to fall into disrepair and has angered the forest gods. She kind of has good reason to be mad.\nThe reception at Iron Town is mixed, as many distrust the newcomer Ashitaka. Ashitaka learns that everyone in the village helps mine the iron, with the women operating the mighty bellows themselves. Lady Eboshi also explains that San really has it in for her (because of the forest damage Eboshi's caused) and that when the Forest Spirit himself is dead, San will become human (although to the viewer she looks perfectly human as it is). San, raised by wolves, is not on board with this eventuality.\nAll of which leads to everyone fighting everyone, with mass destruction guaranteed. Iron Town is under siege by Lord Asano and his samurai, who wish to control the iron ore. The Iron Town citizens are left to defend themselves against Asano while Eboshi and Jigo the monk seek out the Forest Spirit; Jigo has a letter from the Emperor himself that guarantees a large sum of money if Jigo can bring the Forest Spirit's head to the Emperor (who believes it will grant him immortality). Then there are an entire tribe of huge wild boars who want to avenge the death of one of their own \u2013 the boar that wound up cursing Ashitaka to kick all of this off \u2013 as well taken on the humans for being humans. Oh, and apes who also want to kill the humans, particularly Ashitaka, whom they want to eat so they can gain his strength.\nThere's plenty of action, in other words. In fact, the violence is a bit more explicit than you might expect in an animated film. When Ashitaka is first dealing with his curse, he fires an arrow at a soldier who is attacking him; the arrow cuts the man's arm clean off. Ashitaka doesn't know his own strength, it would seem. There's also a fair amount of blood, and a couple of particularly icky scenes: one in which San removes a bullet from Moro by sucking out the blood and spitting it out and another in which San helps Ashitaka eat by first chewing beef jerky and then passing it to him by mouth (he's very weak, you see). I understand, but eww.\nPrincess Mononoke has plenty of strong-willed characters, and many of them are female: San, Lady Eboshi, and Moro, plus Ashitaka and Jigo. The Forest Spirit is a wonder to behold, too, appearing to be part human, part ape, part deer, and probably parts of lots of other animals as well. And the visuals are about what I expected from the maestro Miyazaki, although I think they weren't quite as well developed as they were in some of his other works, like the earlier Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. And it's also possible that there are just too many characters and plot lines and conflicts in Princess Mononoke to easily track. But overall, this is an unquestionable triumph of animation."}

The bad news is that it's a sequel mostly in name, but the good (great) news is that it's every bit as deliciously violent and captivating as its predecessor.\nClint Eastwood returns, although he's no longer The Man with No Name; he's Monco, a \"bounty killer\" \u2013 not a bounty hunter, because that might imply he intends to bring 'em back alive. Monco has his eyes on a desperado named Indio, played by Italian actor Gian Maria Volont\u00e8. Trouble is, another bounty killer, name of Colonel Mortimer (Lee van Cleef) also wants Indio. The fact that the man has a reward of $10,000 on his head probably figures into things a little. Add in the rest of the gang, and you're looking at maybe $27,000. Which today I assume would be $75 million. I don't know, you look it up.\nMortimer and Monco do decide to team up; after all, we can't have too many bad guys. That doesn't mean that they won't try to double cross one another. The plan is for Monco to infiltrate Indio's band and get him to move north, toward the town of El Paso, where they'll attempt to rob the town's Fort-Knox-like bank. Oh, Indio goes north all right, with Monco, and the bank is hit, but\u0085well, let's just say things don't go as planned for anyone.\nFor a Few Dollars More is an epic, even though it's \"only\" 132 minutes long. I mean it's an epic in the same way that Lawrence of Arabia is an epic, with majestic, sweeping vistas followed by (in Leone's case) extreme closeups of the three leads. There are duels in the streets, just as you'd expect a western to have. For all I know, this happened all the time, and in this movie it happens repeatedly. Still, it's not as if every fight is carefully sanctioned, as there are plenty of ambushes to be found.\nThis was the middle film in the series that really put the then-somewhat-young Eastwood on the map. Van Cleef's Mortimer calls him \"kid,\" and Eastwood's calls Mortimer \"old man\"; in reality, the two were only five years apart in age. Eastwood, of course, is still kicking; he turned 86 a couple of months ago. Maybe his days as a taciturn gunslinger are long behind him, but he's still a creative genius. And he learned a lot of the directorial tricks of the trade from Leone himself, a master of the western genre. This, along with its series counterparts, is definitely not to be missed."}

But scary it is, particularly for those folks who lost their jobs, savings, and homes as a result. Odds are pretty good that you or someone you know was directly affected by this avoidable catastrophe.\nThe movie focuses on a few Wall Street guys who figured out years in advance that the housing bubble was going to burst. In the movie, their names are Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling), Michael Burry (Christian Bale), Mark Baum (Steve Carell), Charlie Geller (John Magaro), and Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock). The script, by director Adam McKay and Charles Randolph, changes the names and some relatively minor details, but everything's based on fact. And since we know how it all turned out (hint: there was a collapse), there isn't much suspense left.\nAnd yet the movie succeeds. The casting is great, for one thing \u2013 check out Carell as a broker with a strong moral center and some serious anger-management issues. His is a role ripe for overacting, but Carell never goes overboard, doing a perfect slow, slow, slow burn as he grills various money managers about their methods, which aren't pretty.\nThere's also humor, a flavor that's desperately needed when dealing with a real-life tale of misery, don't you think? Injecting a little humor into the situation makes the characters look, well, more like human beings than fine-suited Wall Street fellas. That's not to say that there are no poignant moments: one scene in particular involves Carell's Mark Baum and his wife, played by the always-terrific Marisa Tomei. Finally, several of the characters break the proverbial fourth wall, addressing the audience with asides \u2013 some of which involve disclaimers about what exactly in the present scene is 100% true and what's been tweaked a little bit. Believe me, it works.\nAnd if that weren't enough to keep the movie wildly entertaining, the script takes time to explain certain relevant financial terms to its audience without being boring or dreary. Terms like CDO, explained by master chef Anthony Bourdain (comparing a CDO to fish that remained unsold at his restaurant at the end of the day), or derivatives, explained by pop star Selena Gomez and economist Richard Thaler. It felt weird understand what they were talking about.\nBut here's the scariest part of it all. The viewer spends a couple of hours following this sordid tale. We see the bad guys, we see the good guys, and we know that if this were fiction, the bad guys would probably get theirs in the end. But it's not, and we know they don't. We know that despite the canary-in-the-mine behavior of these guys, millions of people lost their jobs. And really, none of them were the movers and shakers on Wall Street. That's because when the big banks had bad mortgages that were in danger of defaulting, they packaged them up and sold them to someone else, who did the same thing to someone else, all the way down the line. The poor sap left holding the bag when the bubble burst lost it all, and those who instigated it lost zilch. That's the terrifying part. All of this in concert between Wall Street, its private-sector overseers, the government, and Big Business. They raked in the dough by breaking the law and, even when caught, suffered few consequences themselves. Which makes The Big Short ten times more horrifying than any gorefest movie I've seen."}

It's a taut, superbly suspenseful thriller, guided with a steady hand by director Henri-Georges Clouzot, who would go on to direct the classic Diabolique in 1955.\nYves Montand, in a rare dramatic role, plays Mario, the ostensible protagonist of our tale. He's been stuck in this backwater for some time, but it costs a lot of money to get out \u2013 plane fares are through the roof, and there's no train, and there's no neighboring village. In short, you're stuck there until you can buy a ticket \u2013 and pay for a passport, of course.\nMario spends his days looking for work, wooing tavern worker Linda, and despairing about the lack of work. There's an American oil company in town, but they're no longer hiring. His monotonous lifestyle is interrupted by the arrival of fellow expat Jo (Charles Vanel), a tough-looking older man who quickly wins Mario's favor at the expense of the rest of the men in town.\nThe oil company, in fact, has its own problem \u2013 one of their large derricks has exploded, causing a huge oil fire. Company man Bill O'Brien decides to send two trucks loaded with nitro from the town up the mountain to the derrick. (The eventual idea is to set off charges, which will somehow contain or extinguish the fire.) O'Brien has no trouble scaring up volunteers for the task, since the men of the town are largely unemployed. Four men will be selected to take the two trucks. Only one truck is needed; the second is truly just in case there's an accident with the first one. The men will receive $2000 when the work is finished, more than enough to secure passage out of the backwater.\nMario and Jo are chosen, as are Mario's roommate Luigi (Folco Lulli) and German expat Bimba (Peter van Eyck). The two trucks depart early in the morning, full of gas and of nitro. Danger awaits.\nTheirs is not an easy task. The road is full of ruts. In one place, the wooden deck that trucks use to make a sharp turn up the mountain has been damaged from disuse. It's hot and muggy. And one has to be very, very careful, as even the smallest bump might set the whole shebang off. There's also tension among the four drivers \u2013 Luigi is unhappy that Mario is spending more time with Jo than with him, Mario is unhappy with what he perceives as Jo's cowardice. Bimba seems to get along with everyone, though.\nThe whole time I was watching this movie, I was certain not all four were going to make it. I will not spoil what is now a sixty-three-year-old movie, but I was still genuinely surprised by the ending. This ain't no fairy tale or sitcom. This is a movie about desperation, redemption, sacrifice, and comeuppance. It's not necessarily about justice.\nThe Wages of Fear is a singularly terrific movie from start to finish, exquisitely shot and expertly written. Its money maker is its tension, something present here in spades. The writing is impeccable; even personality changes make perfect sense within the film's context. There are intricacies within a straightforward plot. This is a must see for lovers of thrillers."}

It's a tender, affecting moment that neatly offsets the humor of the rest of the film. It's such a beautiful scene, in fact, that I grew misty eyed and euphoric, and that's how Shakespeare movies and plays are supposed to make you feel.\nElegant without being condescending, Whedon's modern-day take on the classic comedy of errors is a masterpiece. In short, Don Pedro, his right-hand man Claudio, and his brother Don John visit a noble named Leonato. Leonato has a daughter named Hero, with whom Claudio quickly becomes infatuated. Don Pedro offers to woo Hero at the evening's costume party, whereupon he will \"give\" the young lady (with papa's permission) to Claudio. Simple subterfuge, but all is revealed to Hero, and all is well. Until the villainous Don John gets involved, that is, and a major misunderstanding tears the couple apart.\nWhile all of this is going on, Claudio's best pal Benedick - an avowed bachelor who scorns marriage - spars verbally with Hero's cousin Beatrice, who is equally adamant on the topic of marriage. This being Shakespeare, I think we have a good idea where these two are headed. Oh, and along for the more-obvious comic relief (as opposed to the more cultured banter between Beatrice and Benedick) is the local night watchmen, overseen by Dogberry, a man who would have trouble detecting his own behind with both hands. I'm digressing, but you get the idea.\nI won't go too much deeper into the plot, because most viewers probably had to read the play in high school or college. Since it's a comedy, suffice to say that all's well that ends well. But the performances! Many of the players had worked with Whedon on earlier projects such as Angel, Buffy, Castle, Firefly, and The Avengers and may be familiar by look if not by name. Nathan Fillion, the able captain of the good ship Firefly, is well cast as the clueless Dogberry (in one memorable ad-libbed scene, Dogberry and his assistant realize they've locked their keys in their car and frantically search their pockets). Clark Gregg, Agent Coulson to you, plays Leonato. But the entire cast stands out. This is a real triumph of talent, expertly shot (at Whedon's own house) and acted with such audacity and tenaciousness."}

It's not always an easy film to watch, but it's utterly gripping and (improbably) humorous at turns.\nThe movie centers on a boy/young man named Rocket (Buscap\u00e9 in Portuguese, the spoken language in this movie) in the titular slum, the wrong side of the tracks in Rio. Rocket's older brother is in a gang called the Tender Three; this trio commits armed robbery but gives at least some of the proceeds to their impoverished brothers and sisters. The gang's not for long in this story, as one of their sidekick Little Rascals, Li'l Dice (Douglas Silva) has higher aspirations; soon he \u2013 under a new moniker, Li'l Ze' \u2013 is the top kingpin in the City of God. Ze's chief rival, as time goes by, is a ginger-top named Carrot (Matheus Nachtergaele). As Carrot and Ze' fight each other for control of, well, everything, Rocket tries hard to stay above and out of the fray. He's not entirely successful.\nThe movie is quickly paced. If you don't pay attention you may lose track of who's who, if only because there are plenty of supporting characters. Alice Braga, niece to one Sonia Braga, plays a one-time love interest for Rocket. Hers was the only familiar face for me, but many of the fine young actors (or nonactors, as the case may be) offered compelling standout performances.\nAnd this was all based on a true story, as they say. During the closing credits news footage, including interviews with gang members, is shown. The real Rocket appears, as well. Most striking? Might be the group of little kids known as the Runts; this cohort robs, maims, and kills everyone they can \u2013 ostensibly under the control of Carrot, but truthfully subservient to none. Close your eyes and imagine a five-year-old kid shooting someone in cold blood. That was this slum in this time period."}

By the time Gog (1954, **) was released to theaters, though, the craze had subsided quite a bit. So much so, in fact, that although it was filmed in 3D, most theaters had rid themselves of their 3D projectors, and Gog was instead released in 2D to an underwhelmed audience. It apparently was shown in 3D just a small handful of times, mainly in California. And then, after Gog's theatrical run, the 3D prints were damaged. 3D movies, at the time, were put together using a two-camera setup (left side of a scene, right side of a scene); the resulting films were then combined. The left side of the film was deemed beyond repair for decades until new technology came along. When I saw it recently at the American Film Institute's Silver Theater during its inaugural Fantastic Film Showcase, it was apparently the first time the movie had been screened in 3D in Maryland. Cool! In the movie, a military investigator played by Richard Egan arrives at a remote desert base to look into the death of a scientist and his assistant. There are plenty of researchers at the base, and Egan learns that they're all working toward one goal \u2013 a space station! This is well before any humans had even made it to space, of course, so to the contemporary audience this must have seemed fantastical. Egan meets the various researchers in turn, including Dr. Van Ness (Herbert Marshall), who's in charge of the whole shebang, and his assistant Joanna (Constance Dowling). But most intriguing aren't the humans at the base, it's these two 600-pound robots, named Gog and Magog. (Don't ask me why they're so named.) Obviously, since the name of the movie is Gog, these two will factor into the plot somehow.\nFor a 60-year-old movie, the 3D effects are pretty good. Sure, sometimes their use is a bit over the top \u2013 that is, there are scenes that appear to exist solely because of the 3D feature \u2013 but there's no sense of overuse. The viewer isn't bludgeoned with 3D, and instead 3D sort of assimilated into the movie.\nThis being a 50s sci-fi movie, don't expect much in the way of scientific accuracy. There's an unintentionally funny scene where one snooty scientist scoffs that man is never meant to be in outer space. Never! Here we are, 62 years later, and we've been to the moon and sent robots to Mars and spacecraft out of the solar system. So there! If you get a chance to watch Gog in 3D, please do. It's not as if it won't make sense in good old 2D, but the threadbare plot and the strained acting will bother you much less if you can enjoy the now-antiquated extra dimension."}

Many of these movies are foreign films, but that's a \"problem\" I can easily get past. (Hello, subtitles!) There's no excuse for not seeing them, not now.\nLife Is Beautiful (1997, ****) is one of those films. The movie has Oscar written all over it, and in fact it won three (Best Actor, Best Foreign Film, Best Original Score). It was released nearly 20 years ago, so it's no longer new but not quite old enough (in my mind) to qualify as an old movie.\nSo now I've finally watched it. What a glorious film! What a flawless film, too, from the acting to the cinematography to the terrific plot \u2013 including the subtle shift, about halfway through, from broad comedy to dark comedy with a tinge of sadness. You don't see that sort of mix often with movies that have a Holocaust theme. Oh, did I give something away? No, I did not.\nHere's the synopsis. Roberto Benigni plays a Jewish-Italian librarian in 1930s Italy. Guido is a fun-loving cut-up with impeccable comic timing, and it's with his quick wit and that timing that he woos and wins over a noble lass named Dora, played by Benigni's real-life wife, Nicoletta Braschi. That's generally the first half of the movie, with Guido's antics providing some hilarious entertainment. The man rescues his lady with a green horse! But, you see, Guido is Jewish, and did I mention this was 1930s Italy? The Nazis are around, and Guido, Dora, and their young son Joshua are rounded up and taken to a concentration camp. Dora is immediately separated from her son and husband. Guido and Joshua are taken to some stark, ugly barracks. Guido knows perfectly well what's going on, but he desperately wants to prevent Joshua from knowing the awful truth of their predicament. So he tells the boy that everyone \u2013 the other prisoners, the guards, his mom \u2013 are part of an elaborate game. The winner gets to take home a tank! The rules include not asking for one's mommy, not crying, and not saying you're hungry.\nElaborate isn't the word for it, frankly. The other prisoners play along, too. Guido's love for his son is so powerful that he refuses to let the lad lose hope, even when other children insist that the guards turn people like Joshua into soap and buttons. Guido's indomitable spirit saves Joshua.\nBenigni is amazing and justifiably won an Oscar for this movie. Remember him famously walking over seats to get to the stage at the Academy Awards? His outsized personality commands Life Is Beautiful, imploring us to find serenity, compassion, and love in even the most impossible places. Truly a triumphant film."}

Two other men, one older and the other a priest, are already there. The older one keeps muttering that he \"can't understand it.\" What can't he understand, asks the new guy. And so the older man, a woodcutter, tells his tale. He'd been out in the woods a few days prior and came across a lady's hat, a samurai's cap, pieces of cut rope\u0085and a dead man. The woodcutter explains to his companions that he ran to find the police. The scene shifts to a minimalist outdoor courtroom, where the woodcutter testifies. The next witness is led by a rope by a man who claims to have caught him \u2013 the prisoner is a bandit, played by the legendary Toshiro Mifune. His captor says he came upon the bandit after the latter had apparently been thrown from his horse and was slaking his thirst at a lake. After the captor tells his tale, the impulsive bandit ridicules him and gives his version, which begins with his spotting a young lady riding a horse in the forest, being led by her husband, a samurai.\nThe bandit says that he wanted the young lady for himself, so he lured the samurai away from her and then attacked him, tying him up with rope. Then he abducted the lady and had his way with her, with the husband still tied up. The end result is that the samurai is killed.\nThe lady follows with her story, and then we get a third version from the deceased samurai, through a medium. Each of the speakers blames someone else for the murder, and other details in their stories don't match, either.\nOkay, so there's plenty more that I'm intentionally leaving out so I don't spoil this 60-year-old movie for you all. Suffice to say we have multiple stories that contradict each other, a plot hook that's shown up in countless movies since then \u2013 like Reservoir Dogs, for that matter.\nRashomon is a stirring visual masterpiece, brilliantly directed and photographed. It's definitely a classic. But there is a plot point I have an issue with. We hear these stories, and it's obvious that only one can be the truth \u2013 they contradict each other, but they do so consistently. That is, the same detail will differ from story to story.

Getting away to get away, in other words. Anne and Paul busy themselves fixing up the old place, but it's not long before Anne's getting the willies \u2013 you know, weird sounds in the night, things moving that shouldn't be able to move even a littler. Paul, ever the pragmatist, insists there's a logical explanation, but he consents to having hippie-New Age friends of theirs, May and Jacob (Lisa Marie and Larry Fessenden) come up for a few days. You know, to calm things down. Of course, May and Jacob are into spiritual matters, and May instantly feels a presence. Is it the dead son of Paul and Anne? Meanwhile, May and Jacob's own son Harry is also coming up for a visit with his girlfriend Daniella.\nTrue to its bloodline (ha), We Are Still Here does have plenty of blood, but it's the terrifying kind, not the Friday the 13th kind. That is, you genuinely feel like you're in this farmhouse with these normal folks, trying to communicate with the dead. The dead, it seems, bring dread. And death, which is sort of their thing. There are plenty of frights and good twists, with quick pacing and some visceral visuals. Huge praise is also due to Monte Markham, who plays a neighbor who knows more than he's letting on. Probably."}

There are several problems with it that will be noticed by even someone who's just vaguely familiar with the characters. There are too many story lines and too many characters. There are plot holes. The plot is also staggeringly familiar. Continuity with the earlier films is almost nonexistent.\nIt's all about the first (apparently) mutant, En Sabah Nur (Oscar Isaac). We meet up with him in ancient Egypt as he's somehow transferring his consciousness into a new body, seeing as how his current one's decrepit. Then there's a rebellion, the transference doesn't quite take, and everyone's buried under rock and sand for centuries. Until the present, when an undercover CIA agent (don't ask) wanders to a subterranean lair in Cairo but doesn't cover up the entrance with a carpet, thus allowing the sun to come in and revive En Sabah Nur, who then proceeds to kill people with his mind and recruit mutants.\nMeanwhile! In eastern Europe, Magneto, I mean Eric Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) is living the simple life as a factory worker with a doting wife and a little girl, which certainly means bad things will happen, as they do. (This is set after he tried to kill the president but was stopped by Mystique.) Short story long, Magneto flips the heck out, has a crisis of conscience, kills people, and flees. But not before shouting, \"What do you want from me?\" to the heavens. He's recruited by En Sabah Nur (who, by the way, is the Apocalypse of the title). En Sabah Nur's plan is to destroy Earth and build a new society, in other words the same as countless other villains.\nAnd because En Sabah Nur is such a strong mutant, he's able to get into the mind of one Charles Xavier \u2013 manipulate him, in fact. Which allows En Sabah Nur to find all the mutants he needs, and which also gives director Bryan Singer a chance to bring out a plethora of X-characters, like Storm, Psylocke, Cyclops, Beast, Angel, Havoc, Mystique (of course), and Jean Grey. Most of these characters were in earlier X-Men movies, but now they're all different ages. I don't mean different just from the other movies, I mean different relative to each other. Like in an earlier movie, two characters might be about the same age, and here they're suddenly a generation or so apart.\nX-Men: Apocalypse isn't dull, but it's way too convoluted for the franchise. It's almost as if no one thought there'd be any more of these films after this one, so they had to cram everyone in. The result \u2013 too many characters; a winding, tortuous plot; story lines with no real resolution; and general incoherence. It's a kitchen sink approach that just never works. Some actors fare well, such as Nicholas Hoult as Beast and Evan Peters as Quicksilver (who, incidentally, has the best scene in the movie, hands down). Some mail it in, like McAvoy and Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique). Some try their best, like Isaac and Fassbender. And some seem ill-equipped and over their heads, like Sophie Turner, who plays the indomitable (but young) Jean Grey. Turner is really wooden."}

Welcome to 1969, where apparently this kind of hazy reality was, like, a reality.\nSometime after finding Wanda's body, Jimmy runs into...Wanda. Wait, isn't she dead?

He likely isn't, because he has a girl named Rita (Barbara McNair), a singer in the combo wherein he jazz trumpets. And Rita can see Wanda, so it's not like Wanda appears only to Jimmy. So maybe Rita's dead too. It's not really important.\nVisually speaking, this isn't a bad effort. And the score, particularly the jazz, is really cooking. James Darren isn't a bad actor.

At an all-girls school in 1969, students fall faint following an on-campus tragedy. The fainting spells don't last long, but since fainting is hardly a contagious disorder, the underlying cause is unknown. Worse - and unsurprisingly - most of the non-fainters believe that the girls are faking their episodes.\nInteresting idea, right? The plot centers on the friendship between troubled, stressed Lydia (Maisie Williams of Game of Thrones) and golden girl Abbie (Florence Pugh). Lydia lives with her hasn't-left-home-in-16-years mother and her brother Kenneth.\nSo what went wrong? Let me count the ways. 1) The reason for the fainting, i.e., the premise of the film, is never satisfactorily explained. Heck, by the final twenty minutes the fainting is an afterthought. 2) There's a shocking subplot that rears its head late in the movie that disappears a couple of scenes later, seemingly unrelated to the fainting. 3) Rather than explore why the girls are becoming ill, the movie focuses on the fact that no one believes them, going as far as putting all of them in the hospital to be physically and psychologically grilled, apparently in an attempt to break them. 4) The relationship between Lydia and her agoraphobic mom simmers near the boiling point for much of the film, erupts once, and then is halfheartedly explained away.\nWatch this movie (at your own peril) and see if you can figure out why everyone's fainting, or even if they in fact really are. There are hints of supernatural activity - isolated school, scenes in which the girls hold hands in a ring, a la occult worship, a forbidding lake - but it's never clear if any of these aspects has anything to do whatsoever with the girls' maladies. Oh, in case you didn't know, this is also a coming-of-age movie, as so many of them set in girls-only schools are. Perhaps the fainting is a rite of passage into womanhood? Unless you have exceedingly low expectations, you cannot watch this movie and be satisfied by its conclusion. The cast tries hard, and can you believe Greta Scacchi (Shattered, Presumed Innocent) plays the headmistress? Shades of Suspiria. But the direction and editing (particularly microsecond-brief \"visions\") are the stuff of nonsense."}

Trio of twentysomethings, stuck in the middle of nowhere (Australian Outback), is terrorized by a bushwhacking loner after they accept his help. It's a familiar setup, yeah, but things didn't play out as I thought they would, not entirely.\nEarly on, when the gang stops for gas - one of those desolate bar/gas station hybrids where there's plenty of gruntin' to be heard - a local begins to give them a hard time and then finds himself mildly insulted. Cue ominous music; we're sure to see said local opening up a can of whoop-ass on the tourists, right? Well... maybe? Their car breaks down at the Wolf(e) Creek Crater. Won't start. Watches stop too, for some reason. Gruff backwoodsman (backdesert?) offers help, although he makes them feel uneasy. They accept, because what the heck. Can't fix the car there, but he can tow them to his place and have them on the road in the morning. Can't tow them into town, because he's heading south and...well, it's an excuse, anyway. So they accept the tow.\nNow, the movie is expertly shot against a gorgeous Outback backdrop. The crater is pretty, ominous, and breathtaking. This is in contrast to the helpful guy's compound/house, which is gloomy and murky. Adding to the atmosphere is a somewhat-brief thunderstorm, which makes the hikers' situation seem all the more perilous.\nJohn Jarratt plays Mick Taylor, the bushman with nefarious plans, and he's perfectly diabolic. You get the feeling he was busted out of prison, where he was being held for terrorizing tourists, just to play this role. I assume he's an actor, but he could have fooled me. The do-gooder tourists playing against him are all fine, too, and thanks to an offbeat script don't fall prey to the normal typecasting that their particular roles demand.\nThere is plenty of blood and violence, but it doesn't drive the narrative, and it doesn't seem particularly gratuitous."}

The door opens, and the young man's boss walks in and notes the predictability (and banality) of drowning one's sorrows in liquor, particularly after a little humiliation has occurred. The interaction was a little ironic, because up until just a scene or two earlier the movie seemed to be fairly predictable and straightforward. Luckily, the story zig-zagged thereafter.\nTo be honest, I wasn't really sure I wanted to watch Resurrecting the Champ, a drama about a young reporter who discovers that a former boxing great is living on the streets of Denver. It sounded a little too melodramatic for my tastes, following the formula of the idealistic lad saving the bitter ex-jock.\nBut that's not quite how it goes. Erik Kernan, Jr. (Josh Hartnett) is a reporter for a Denver newspaper. He covers boxing, but his stories are buried deep in the sports section by his boss, Ralph Metz (Alan Alda), who pegs Erik's writing as ordinary but sufficient. Meanwhile, Erik is dealing with his separation from his wife Joyce (Kathryn Morris), who has custody of their young son Teddy, and he feels as if he's stuck in stasis with his current job.\nAll of that changes when, while walking home late one night, he comes across a trio of drunken college-age kids beating up a homeless man. The homeless man, known as Champ (Samuel L. Jackson) mentions that he's Bob Satterfield, a pugilist long thought to have shuffled off this mortal coil. He regales Erik with tales within the squared circle, including fights against Rocky Marciano and Floyd Patterson. Naturally, Erik sees this as an opportunity to do some substantive writing for a change, and with Champ's permission he writes a story for a local magazine profiling Champ and his post-boxing life.\nEverything goes along swimmingly, as you might expect, until it does not, which you also might expect. What you might not expect is how and when the tone shifts \u2013 and how the principal characters each deal with the change. The film seems to be asking us who the victim and the antagonist are in this play.\nThe good news is that Jackson is on fire. He rises above caricature in his portrayal of Champ \u2013 he doesn't go for cheap laughs or oversell Champ's homelessness or personality twitches. His Champ seems to have been come by honestly; in retrospect, the performance feels authentic and divinely from the heart. Jackson doesn't satirize a homeless wreck of a man, he inhabits him.\nThe more-disappointing news is that Hartnett is a little underwhelming. He's been excellent (Lucky Number Slevin) before, but here he just didn't rise to the challenge. Hartnett tries his best to convey the deep emotion that Erik feels, but he spends way too much time using \"run fingers through own hair\" as a way to show consternation or frustration. Or elation, for that matter.\n#3,980 is a fine, understated film that doesn't really take off until the final reel, and even then the denouement falls a little flat."}

Wood plays Nick, the webmaster of a fan site dedicated to pretty, young actress Jill Goddard (Grey) who finds himself smack dab in the middle of intrigue when, after winning a contest that promises a date with the starlet, he finds that the rendezvous has been summarily canceled. But that ain't all, as they say.\nSo one moment Frodo is watching Goddard and others at a convention, remotely from his hotel room (no invite?), and the next he's learning there is no date \u2013 from a mysterious voice in his laptop who's named himself Chord. Chord promises to set things aright, though; he can gain access to Jill's phone, and they can both have some fun \u2013 since, Chord claims, she's the one who broke off the dinner.\nThings kind of spiral out of control, with the twists becoming more ludicrous as they progress. Red herrings abound. But there was just enough intrigue to keep me mildly interested, because the movie is never entirely predictable. Cheesy, yes, but not predictable. I couldn't figure out the end game. Someone was obviously not who they seemed to be. Someone was obviously going to turn on someone. These things happen. So I kept looking for clues and, finding none, went with the flow.\nProblem #1: The movie is filmed similarly to a found-footage film in that scenes are viewed through webcam (or phone camera) footage. It's the kind of gimmick that one must stick with if it's introduced at the beginning. Which, yeah, this one is, and yeah, it's kept up throughout. But the gimmick just gets old \u2013 it's sort of like watching the opening to a complex theme park ride, where the protagonists explain all the things you the rider will experience. In other words, I wasn't immersed in the experienced as much as held at a voyeuristic arm's length.\nProblem #2: Elijah Wood, who I'm sure is a really nice guy and who made for a great Hobbit, doesn't quite have the gravitas needed for the role. I had trouble shaking the idea that he had somehow gotten a hold of his dad's credit card and booked a nice hotel room for himself and was now going on an adventure that would wind up with him getting bailed out by his older brother. I don't know, he just didn't feel right in the role. Like I said \u2013 probably a swell feller, but this is not his movie.\nSurprisingly, former porn star Sasha Grey is pretty satisfying as Jill Goddard. It's said she took the role because, as a recognizable star (of sorts) she's experienced fanboys. And it's a good role for her; she's pretty and believable as the Next Big Thing among actresses. It helps that she doesn't overact, melodramatically playing a vulnerable young woman. Seems to me that novice actors make that mistake all the time, that they just can't offer a nuanced performance. Grey's performance, although not flawless, definitely contains shades. Of Grey. See what I did there? Ultimately, Open Windows is kind of nonsensical, with an overly complex plot and a lackluster lead performance. Frankly, it's only because of Gray and the minute intrigue that this sucker gets four stars instead of only two."}

< {"rating": "6", "date": "30 September 2015", "title_id": "tt3170832", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "A Series of Plodding Events", "content": "At the start of Room, a young woman and her five-year-old son are living in the titular edifice, a backyard shed. The woman (Brie Larson) has always told Jack (Jacob Tremblay) that \"outer space\" is all that exists outside Room; as far as Jack is concerned, this is the gospel truth and the universe consists of Room and Room alone.\nIt is not giving anything away to note that Ma and Jack escape Room, as the movie is more about the ability of each to cope with the outside world. For Jack, every step and every breath outside is a wholly new experience. Ma, despite having lived for 17 years before coming to Room, encounters different obstacles \u2013 the world has moved on, and she doubts her own ability as a mother to Jack.\nI had been expecting a suspenseful drama-thriller about a daring escape, given the various synopses I'd read. (The movie is based on a novel by Emma Donoghue, which is itself loosely based on real events.) Much of the first half of the film, though, concentrates on life inside Room for Ma and Jack. Ma uses her strong will and infinite patience to convince Jack for five years that all is well and that what they have is a normal life, that what they see on television is not real, but everything from the single bed to the lidless toilet tank is definitely real. Ma sacrifices as much as she can to keep Jack happy and (relatively) safe, even to the point of giving herself over to her captor on a regular basis in exchange for food and other items for Jack and herself.\nTo say that this first half moves slowly would be to understate things. We don't just get a slice of the life that the duo leads; we get the entire pie, and most of it just isn't all that exciting or intriguing. We do get to see a little into the characters of the characters, pardon the phrasing. We see that Jack doesn't like to not get his way or to have his worldview challenged. Then again, who does at age 5? We see that Ma is often calm but firm with her young charge. It's a small Room, after all; no need to go nuclear when there's really no point to it. In any event, much time is spent watching their everyday sheltered lives. Because the general plot involved their lives beyond Room, I began to grow impatient: Were they going to spend the entire movie in Room, only to escape in the final minutes? Why wouldn't anything happen? The fact that Ma and Jack would eventually escape left the first half of the movie perfectly devoid of suspense. Although still waters do often run deep, I didn't really feel like I was getting a lot out of watching a whole lot of nothing.\nOnce they do escape, though, things pick up. The focus quickly shifts from a struggle for survival to a struggle to understand. Ma's parents, played by Joan Allen and William H. Macy, have different reactions to the return of their daughter and the arrival of their new (to them) grandson. In the five years since Ma's abduction, her parents have separated; her dad lives on the other side of the country now, and her mom lives with her friend Leo (Tom McCamus). With Ma's return, there's a lot of media hype, and lawyers, atop a potent array of stress factors. Escaping may have been the easy part.\nThe acting is uniformly terrific. Larson's work is powerful, evocative, and heart-wrenching, and it's definitely award worthy. Allen and Macy also excel with perhaps the best work in their respective careers, and that's saying something. Young Tremblay is also very good \u2013 as is his character, a plucky, long-haired cherub who's more at home in Room than in the outside world (and with good reason).\nBut the acting cannot overcome what's basically a very turgid script. Room is punchless at its core, and it would be a total waste if it weren't for the Herculean efforts of its talented cast. When there is no action, I look for meaning. When there is no meaning or action, I look for the exit. Room suffers from spending too much time contemplating things and not enough time doing them \u2013 or at least discussing them. Forget the action, I wouldn't have minded seeing more reaction. The first half of the movie could have been subtitled \"A Series of Plodding Events.\" The second half goes a long way toward saving the first, thanks in part to additional characters and a fresh setting, but it's not enough to save the entire movie."}

Although it is set some twenty years after the events of the first film, and although the similar plot centers around a theme park with live dinosaurs, there appear to have been no lessons learned. The entire movie feels as if the viewer is stranded on the island with everyone else, except that they're on the Island of Poor Decision-Making Skills and not fabled Isla Nublar.\nLike most people, I was pretty charged up to see the new movie, since it'd been so long since the first go-around that the special effects have become much more invigorating and realistic. As fate would have it, however, the effects looked to be about the same as they had been in 1993, and that's saying something. I even saw the movie in 3D, thinking that lifelike dinosaurs would help make good use of that technology. Nothing doing. The 3D felt almost nonexistent, and not in the sense that it melted into the background (so to speak). It felt, in fact, as if someone had forgotten to leave it on for the duration of the movie.\nJurassic World is set in what's more or less the present day. The park has indeed reopened, under the stewardship of Masrani (Irrfan Khan of Life of Pi). Masrani presents himself as someone who doesn't care so much about profits as he does about people being entertained and wowed by the park's attractions. Yes, sort of reminiscent of John Hammond (Sir Richard Attenborough) and his grand vision for the original park. Masrani's operations manager Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), as the movie opens, is showing off the park to potential sponsors. You know, like the Coca-Cola Pavilion at the World's Fair. Or whoever sponsors Spaceship Earth in EPCOT Center, for those of you who have no idea what the World's Fair was.\nThe same day that Claire meets with the sponsors, her nephews Gray and Zach arrive for some bonding time. Seems Mom and Dad decided to send the boys to the park so that they could interact with Aunt Claire, who hasn't seen them in seven years or so. The presence of the kids on the island forecasts doom from the get-go, because certainly at some point they need to be imperiled. Don't worry; they will be. Being a stereotypical hard-driven, childless woman, Claire hands the boys over to her British assistant, who promptly loses (is ditched by) them. Older brother Zach is moody and somewhat sullen, as teenage boys are wont to be, and younger brother Gray is full of both energy and dino details, much like Timmy from JP1.\nThis time around, the big attractions aren't the T-Rexes (or their exes - ha!); they're bigger and badder. The park's new creature is called Indominus rex, which turns out to be a hybrid of a T-rex and several other animals. Don't ask which animals; it's a secret to everyone, even Claire and Masrani. At any rate, to make sure everything's good to go before the new dinos are unveiled to the public, park trainer Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) is called in to evaluate little Indommy's paddock. The paddock looks secure, all right, but wouldn't you know it, the beast appears to have departed, presumably for a place where one can swallow cows whole without having to wait for a server to show up.\nAnd with that, our plot is really set in motion. There's a dino on the loose! It's funny how this keeps happening. Only now, instead of a few people who are scoping out the park before it officially opens, there are tens of thousands of people on the island, with the park fully open for business. But there's no reason to close the park, right? Of course not! It is not revealing anything of importance to mention that the first group of guards to try to contain Indominus carry nonlethal weapons. You know, so they can stun a seven-story tall monster. This is not as effective as you might think.\nJurassic World is much more action movie than sci-fi movie. Instead of human characters exhibiting human characteristics, we're presented with an relatable group of people. Pratt's Owen is a hero, a good guy who has qualms about mistreating all creatures, but he's more Rambo than Indiana Jones - or Alan Grant. I like that he's there to save us all, but the lack of development of his character, who's sort of a combination of Grant and Ian Malcolm, means the movie takes a step backward in terms of fundamentally sound, creative writing. Perhaps this is the result of four different people having a hand in the screenplay.\nIf you're too young to have experienced Jurassic Park or just plain like dumb and loud action movies, Jurassic World should please you. Kids should like it, particularly since there's little to really scare the pants off them. There are several homages to not only the first JP but also JP II and JP III, which does place this one solidly in the same cinematic universe as those other three. But two hours of chase scenes interrupted by too many haphazardly animated, similar-looking dinosaurs fighting each other and smashing humans may grow tiresome as you await the inevitable and foregone conclusion. Not to mention the obvious setup for a fifth movie."}

Ebert and Siskel were by then already well ingrained in the psyche of the American movie watcher. No longer did we have to rely on the whim of a local newspaper columnist to tell us what may be worth watching. Siskel and Ebert brought life to the movies, and movies to life. Their bickering ran the gamut from the globally sociological to the to the kind of detailed minutia that even the most dedicated cinema nerd would shake his head at. That's what made the show work, and for me it was Ebert's outsized personality that was the true driving force behind it all.\nLife Itself is based on Ebert's memoirs of the same name, and it's directed by Steve James (Hoop Dreams). A good deal of the movie was shot while Ebert was still alive, although the narration in his voice was provided by a very good impressionist after the fact. James intersperses various biographical scenes with present-day Ebert, riddled with pain but still maintaining a two-thumbs-raised attitude. And, lest he be accused of unabashed hagiography, James makes sure that we see the warts of Ebert's life, through the eyes of people close to him - his wife Chaz, Siskel's wife Marlene, critic Richard Corliss, and producers of the TV show.\nEven those of us who knew Ebert as \"the fat one\" on the show knew that there was quite a bit more to the man: his sharp wit, his brilliant prose, and his undeniable zest for all things movies. Truth be told, Roger Ebert was such a talented writer because he was insanely passionate about the movies - what they meant to him personally and what he felt that the average moviegoer would appreciate about them. When you read a review by Ebert, you never really got the feeling that he was issuing an edict from on high, sitting with a quill pen in hand in a small room atop an ivory tower. That was the key to his success. He was writing to you and for you. Roger Ebert was your eyes, your ears, and your voice. Roger Ebert got you.\nThe film journeys from Ebert's upbringing as an only child in a middle-class family to his success running the campus newspaper at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to his days reviewing countless films for the Chicago Sun-Times (as the youngest full-time movie reviewer at a major-market newspaper) to his days as Siskel's sparring partner through to his days as a progenitor of the use of social media to create original content and foster communication with like-minded movie buffs around the world.\nSeveral scenes are of present-day Ebert, and it is these that are the most touching and unnerving. In 2002, he was diagnosed with cancer of the thyroid and salivary glands; unfortunately, infection later set in, and after several further operations, the lower jaw was necessarily removed. James began his documentary after this last procedure, and thus the present-day shots include a jawless Ebert. There are even scenes in which the viewer can clearly see through Ebert's mouth to his sternum.\nThrough all of his medical travails, Ebert continued to work, nurturing a strong online presence, reviewing countless terrible (and great) films, always writing and always from the heart. James, for his part, does a wonderful job capturing not only Ebert's commanding presence (even while infirm) but also his frailities, which Ebert himself owns like a champ. \"This is who I am now,\" he says, particularly in reference to rather unflattering cover photo for Esquire magazine, \"take it or leave it.\" Steve James shows us a flawed Roger Ebert. Ebert is not always right, no matter how loudly he shouts at Gene Siskel. He does not always get his way. He is not always the most likable guy; indeed, in his early years his driving ego was complemented by sheer talent, and eventually the former gave way (mostly) to the latter. Ebert was also a longtime recovering alcoholic and a man who thrived on being the center of attention, a man who desperately wanted to be a part of things and could either play a fool or employ scathing wit to that end.\nLife Itself is not simply a film about a critic, made for condescending movie fans to fawn over. It is a story about a brilliant, flawed man who wrote passionately about movies and other subjects. It is a movie for fans of humanity."}

However, despite the fine pedigree of the director and star, the movie falls a little flat, with a plot that begged for more coherence and elucidation.\nTeenager Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) is one of those kids who loves to learn things. Okay, maybe there aren't many of those kids, but they're probably out there somewhere. Always tinkering, this one.\nCasey lives near Cape Canaveral, where a launch platform is being deconstructed. A launch platform means a job for her dad, who's a NASA guy, so our curious, proactive heroine routinely jumps a fence and sabotages the equipment used to take the whole shebang apart. This leads to Casey getting in trouble with Johnny Law, leading to a very brief stay in a holding cell, but when she emerges among her belongings is a mysterious metal pin with a \"T\" logo on it. That's odd enough, since she had little on her when The Man pinched her, but when she touches the pin, she finds herself somewhere that's most definitely not the police station: a large wheat field with a futuristic city on the horizon.\nCasey's experience dovetails with that of one Frank Walker, a boy inventor who takes his newly cobbled jet pack to the World's Fair and Exposition in 1964 in New York. Like Casey in the present day, Frank finds himself in possession of another of the strange pins, one given to him by eternally childlike Athena.\nBut back to the present. It seems that the pin allows the holder (for a time) to travel to a different dimension. But poor Casey's pin has run out of juice, so she wants to find another mode of transportation. This leads her to the doorstep of one cranky Frank Walker (George Clooney), a recluse who sends out a holographic dog to scare off unwelcome visitors. They're all unwelcome.\nThis being a rather straightforward Disney movie, there's a bad guy, a Governor Nix, played by Hugh Laurie. Nix here represents an obstacle to creativity and imagination, traits that both Frank and Casey proudly display. But, as written, the villain is pretty lame. Not only doesn't Nix attack his perceived opponents, he's actually quite accommodating to them. Very British of him, really. What's more, Nix's reasons for opposing the dynamic duo are actually quite sound, even if the methods aren't. What kind of bad guy is that? We learn very little about the magical new place that Frank and Casey visit. I mean, we know it's futuristic, what with all the flying cars and overall clean atmosphere, but we don't know how it came to be or what its long-term purpose is. We're given some vague platitudes about gather the best minds, but we're never really told to what purpose.\nClooney and Robertson hold their own, even if their interaction does feel a little forced at times. Laurie seems miscast. Tim McGraw plays Casey's dad in a few brief but important scenes. Perhaps the best performance is turned in by young Raffey Cassidy, who plays the enigmatic Athena.\nTomorrowland is, purportedly about the importance of remaining hopeful. Casey is our optimist; Frank is our pessimist. One has the benefit of experience that the other does not. But there's also an undercurrent of environmental awareness, or the imminent mortality of man, and other lighthearted issues.\nFor a Disney live-action film, Tomorrowland is acceptably gregarious. It entertaining in its own right. But as a sci-fi movie, it falls short; there's too much superficial wonder and not enough honest-to-goodness science and ingenious wizardry."}

He owes a lot of money to some bad men, his dad can't loan him the cash, and he's sort of a lowlife. So he hatches a plan to hire a guy to kill his mom so that his younger sister Dottie can get the insurance settlement. This is never a good plan in the movies, and probably not in real life, either. As you may well deduce, things do not go as planned in this excellent crime thriller from an old hand, director William Friedkin.\nChris (Emile Hirsch) knows a guy who knows a guy. The second guy is Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a Dallas police detective who moonlights as a hired killer. Nice work if you can get it, as they say. The intimidating Cooper lets it be known that he wants part of his fee upfront, and it's not a small amount, as a retainer. On the one hand, it's a heck of a lot smaller than the insurance payout will be. On the other hand, neither Chris, his beaten-down dad Ansel (Thomas Haden Church), nor his stepmother Sharla (Gina Gershon) has the money - they were counting on the insurance to be able to pay off Killer Joe. These people are not adept at project planning.\nSo Joe, rather than simply walk away from a situation from which he can't really benefit, comes up with an alternative: the family will \"loan\" him Dottie (Juno Temple), a twentysomething virgin (I know, right?) who's best described as being terminally naive. Now, a normal family might reject this idea outright: What father in his right mind would let an acknowledged killer have his way with his daughter? Well, these aren't normal folks. Besides, they got a killing to attend to.\nAs you may logically conclude, once that little line of selling out your kinfolk has been crossed, there's no turning back. We know full well we're in for a heap of double crossing. And a lot of yelling and screaming. And, as a matter of fact, blood and deadness. So although, on the surface, the plot may look like it's from a low-rent Cinemax feature, the surprising intensity and viciousness of McConaughey and the remarkable supporting cast (particularly Gershon) drive this story a long, long way. Even the writing (by Tracy Letts, who wrote the play on which the movie is based) is crisp and plausible but not overly predictable. Killer Joe is a grimy, grisly, dusty, and foul-mouthed minor classic, presided over by an unlikely bad seed: Matthew McConaughey."}

The relentless pace makes for a wildly exciting film for which the plot is superfluous and generally unnecessary. There is much mayhem and madness. It is quite good.\nThis is perhaps the best pure action movie you'll see this year; even The Avengers and Star Wars have a fully developed story to get in the way. This one is a shot of pure adrenaline that never lets up. Here, the titular antihero has been captured by one of those omnipresent roving biker gangs I expect we'll all see in the near future. Max is turned over to a slaver/warlord named Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who controls water and food for everyone in his stronghold, called The Citadel, doling it out whenever he sees fit. He also uses women for their breast milk and maintains a concubine of several wives, so you know he's not a good guy.\nWorking for Joe - or, rather, idolizing him to the point where they believe he and only he can lead them into the afterlife world of Valhalla - are the War Boys, pale zealots who pilot terrifying vehicles of mass destruction and gain their strength and energy by usurping blood from generous donors - like Max. The War Boys love Max.\nAnyhow, every so often ol' Joe has to send out an Imperator for supplies; the Imperator drives a huge rig called a War Rig that's exceedingly well armed and customized to the driver's tastes. The driver in this case is Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who has another plan in mind - rescue dear Joe's wives and take them to her own birthplace, the Green Place. Joe quickly gets wind of this and sends out a flurry of War Boys. One of the Boys, named Nux, is weak and in need of blood, so he straps the newly captured Max - a universal donor - to a pole on the front of his machine, and the race is on. Mission for the bad guys - stop Furiosa. Mission for the good guys - get to the Green Place by any means necessary.\nReally, the entire movie is a chase across a barren wasteland. It is a post-apocalyptic world, after all. There's leaping from car to car to truck! Oh, and the War Boys? They attach these long, bendy poles on the hoods of their vehicles with one of their own at the top. Then they can bend to and fro and either jump on the War Rig or maybe sneak in through the sun roof, steal a wife or two, and bounce back. Sheer genius! There's an enormous, blinding lightning sandstorm that accounts for much of the CGI in the film, but for the most part the effects are anything but computer generated. Loved the visual look of the movie, too, with washed-out landscapes and colorful foregrounds. Director George Miller's vision shows a world that appears dead on the outside but with glimmers of that most valuable of commodities - hope. And all of the little details, such as the vehicles themselves (some hybrids of 1950s cars, including an original Beetle) and Furiosa's guns and prosthetic arm, add the right touch. And how's his for strange - 3D is put to good use here, with junk (and people) flying off of cars and right between your eyeballs! For much of the first third of the movie, Max wears a face guard that sort of looks like an upside down pitchfork. One would assume Hardy is used to such gear at this point, having been through The Dark Knight Rises as Bane. Here, he's even tougher than Bane, even after he's had blood sapped from him like syrup from a maple tree. Max's name, incidentally, is mentioned only three times in the movie. Which is fine, of course - after all, we the audience know damn well who he is, and the lack of a name for his traveling companions lends itself quite nicely to his anonymity. He's like an even more badass Man with No Name. But he does have compassion, mainly because what haunts poor Max's every waking moment is the feeling that he let innocent people die (see previous three films in the series). Will that happen on Fury Road? Not on his watch! (Possibly.) Hardy is the figurative bomb as Max, a towering dynamo of nonstop energy. Theron gets \"ugly\" again (note: she is not ugly, even here) with a shaved head, big muscles, and an attitude that would make Ellen Ripley or Sarah Connor weep with respect. She should definitely make more action movies, provided they're more like this and not like Aeon Flux. It's always great to see a strong female protagonist, and here we have several; in addition to Furiosa, Immortan Joe's wives aren't wilting flowers but rather ass kickers who can load and fire guns. Pretty refreshing to see that, you know? This latest Mad Max - and will it be the last? - had me on the edge of my seat, which meant that I had to hold on lest I was blown away. But indeed, I was metaphorically blown away anyway, with a much-welcome return to visceral violent cinema in one of the year's top films."}

It's not as if the original movie was so awesome that no remake could ever compare; Peter Weller's RoboCop was a fun action movie with a budget on the lower end of the scale. But this 2014 redo lacks soul, wit, and a point.\nCop Alex Murphy (Swedish actor Joel Kinnaman) works the nation's most violent city - Detroit, of course. He and his partner find out about large-scale corruption in their ranks. The big bad guy who's paying off the other cops gets wind of this discovery and has one of his henchman plant a bomb under Murphy's car. Car goes explodey, but does Murphy die? No, they can rebuild him. They have the technology.\nThey, in this case, is OmniCorp, which is surely a kind, benevolent company that would never seek to profit off war-making machines. Anyway, when Murphy wakes up he's in the lab of one Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman), who has constructed a sort of indestructible exoskeleton around what remains of Murphy's body. The idea is to have Murphy rejoin the police force and solve cases, which will make OmniCorp look like geniuses, and both generals and loose women will throw themselves at the company in gratitude.\nMurphy's suit (it's not really a suit) is equipped with all sorts of weaponry and the ability to access crime databases almost instantaneously. This makes it rather easy to collar the bad guys. But what about the bad guys who put Murphy in this state? That's when OmniCorp and the the Detroit police department get a little uneasy and tug their collars. Or perhaps they're just realizing how bad the movie's turned out.\nMichael Keaton, who was recently Oscar nominated for his work in Birdman, plays the head of OmniCorp, and he basically phones this one in. His character's motivations are to make money, damn the consequences, so maybe the part's not exactly multilayered. One can almost picture Keaton looking over the script, shrugging, and imagining what he'll do with the extra cash on hand. I mean, the guy's name is even Sellars, so Keaton had little to work with. Trouble is, someone of Keaton's acting caliber should have added a lot to a flat line of a character. Oldman, playing his chief scientist, fares no better. Dr. Norton seems like a nice guy who wants to do the right thing, but he lies to Murphy throughout the movie and frequently shows his discontent by sighing and shaking his head. The moral implications, man! Think of the moral implications! Jackie Earle Haley is on hand as an acerbic weapons guy working for Sellars, and again the character feels like a missed opportunity. Haley has shown plenty of charisma in previous roles, but here he's just the guy who doesn't trust Murphy the Cyborg Cop and treats him like dirt. Haley's Maddox is an unfunny jerk with an uncertain axe to grind. Samuel L. Jackson is the host of a pro-robotics TV program who pops up every now and then to wonder why we don't use robot soldiers in the U.S., like other countries do. Abbie Cornish, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, and Jennifer Ehle fill the female roles; if it's any consolation, those roles are just as underwritten as the male ones are. Finally, gender equality! But two actors really stand out in the movie, and certainly not for good reasons. Jay Baruchel, best known for voicing Hiccup in the How to Train Your Dragon movies, is a marketing exec here. But it's really hard to take a business guy seriously when he sounds like he's still going through puberty. Marketers in movies are typically obnoxious, but Baruchel can't even bring the expected (and necessary) level of bluster and crass abrasiveness to the role. He's just annoying. Worst of them all, though, is Kinnaman as Alex Murphy. Kinnaman, perhaps best known for not being Peter Weller, brings little presence to the lead role - no poise, no attitude, no hubris, no nothing. He plays Murphy in such a one-dimensional manner that you'll think you've slipped into an entire universe altogether. (Probably one in which casting a block of wood in a major action movie makes sense.) Kinnaman is in over his head, and essentially his cast can't pick up the slack. There's too much slack. In fact, the entire movie (written by Joshua Zetumer, Edward Neumeier, and Michael Miner, the latter two who co-wrote the original film) is slack.\nThere's plenty of blame to go around for this debacle. Sure, it's a remake, and people rarely expect much out of them. But director Jose Padilha turns in a product that seems to be poorly executed from the ground up. The characters are badly realized sketches on a cocktail napkin. The effects, while updated from 1987, aren't anything to write home about. Every time I saw Kinnaman on screen, I was reminded of Mark Metcalf's character from Animal House, not Peter Weller in RoboCop or even Dustin Hoffman in Outbreak. And while the image of the original movie isn't tarnished (since comparatively few saw this remake/reboot anyway), there seems to be no need for more films in the series."}

And, judging by the box office so far, it's made a lot of other people happy as well. It's a grand continuation of the adventures of familiar characters, but it's so witty, original, and exciting that it's also a terrific stand-alone film.\nThe gang's still around, even though their former employer SHIELD is not. Captain America (Chris Evans) leads the team as they try to root out the last of the HYDRA cells. They do, and they recapture the scepter of Loki, who does not appear in this movie. This leads Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) to decide to revive a dormant AI program, all in the name of peacekeeping, because those things never go wrong. It's clear that Stark would rather move on to do something other than save the world every couple of days, and so he figures the new AI, Ultron, can finally bring peace to the world. Whoopsie! Spoiler alert: It does no such thing.\nThe really awful thing about Ultron isn't that he's super-intelligent and powerful (even more so than JARVIS, Stark's AI-servant), it's that he can pop up in any machine, anywhere, because that's just what you'd expect an evil machine to do - upload himself to the Internet and wreak some havoc.\nUltron (James Spader) comes across twins who are totally not mutants at all because that would infringe on Fox's X-Men copyright - Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who's fast, and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), who's good with the mind games. The bad guy plans to use the duo's loathing of Tony Stark (it's complicated) to help him rid the world of the Avengers.\nMeanwhile, inner conflicts begin to brew among our heroes. Is Stark truly selfish and not a team player? Can Hulk totally Hulk out without making the civilian populace terrified of him? Is Black Widow (Scarlett Johannson) able to deal with her own demons long enough to establish a relationship with Banner? And is Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) good for anything? Joss Whedon once said (reportedly) that working with the Avengers characters is much more demanding than working with, say, the X-Men characters, because the latter share common problems (i.e., they're mutants). The Avengers have different problems from one another, different personalities, and different enemies. One is a god from another realm, and another is in his eighties (technically). So it's not just a matter of getting them to work together as a team against a single enemy, as the different backgrounds sometimes run counter to each other.\nOf all of the characters, though, I think Black Widow is the most layered. We know that Natasha has been through an awful lot, even compared with her teammates, and that's why she's more or less a closed book to them. I also think Johannsson provides an exciting, vulnerable, empowering performance. She's not just playing a superhero - she's a full-fledged character.\nThere are some familiar faces, too - Nick Fury pops up. Sidekicks (sort of?) for I-Man and Cap also make appearances. There is much joking; hilarity often ensues. There's a new layer of levity, in fact. There's an early scene in which Cap takes out a bunch of henchmen with his shield and mutters (paraphrasing here) \"Well, that was fun.\" This is followed by, off-screen, \"No, it wasn't!\" Hee! Hee! With the panache of an old-time serial and the touch of the pathos of a Douglas Sirk drama, the Avengers sequel is a visionary omnibus of meshing styles and genres. I'd call it the pinnacle of comic-book movies, but we have at least two more Avengers films - plus Ant-Man, another Captain America, and on and on."}

And what that awkwardly written sentiment means is that these movies are pretty much the same each time out. Big difference? The ever-changing \"other creature\" that Godzilla must battle. Here, as the big guy Raids Again (!), he goes up against an unnamed angliosaur, which sort of looks like a downtrodden stegosaurus.\nGodzilla is first spotted by a Japanese pilot named Tsukioka as the latter attempts the rescue of a fellow flier, Kobayashi, on a remote island in the Pacific. The two think they're all safe and sound when - suddenly! - they hear the resounding thunder of two mighty beasts fighting. Or, in this case, two well-worn plastic models, or perhaps a couple of guys in suits. It could have been either, frankly. At any rate, back in Japan, scientists explain that the original Godzilla, who was killed in the first film (don't act like you didn't know that), died as a result of an \"oxygen destroyer\"; sadly, the man who invented the device is also dead, and so are any plans. So that answers that. But does it? All's fine, with Godzilla still out in the ocean, minding his own beeswax, until he's rousted by the Japanese air fleet, which makes him head for the island nation. Directly for Osaka, of course, one of the few cities not affected by Godzilla #1. Godzilla wreaks havoc and kicks butt, and then the angliosaur - who they call Angilas, so I guess he wasn't unnamed after all - returns from the sea to battle Godzilla. Big fight ensues. Mass destruction. Lots of carnage.\nGodzilla (who doesn't do any actual raiding)'s second movie was rushed into production, showing in theaters a scant six months after the first movie. Sometimes, it shows. The effects are comically bad, even by 1955 standards. The film's dubbed in English, so naturally the audio's a mismatch. The Godzilla suit that some poor guy has to wear is obviously a Godzilla suit - there are several shots in which the monster turns to a side but the suit doesn't. Perhaps a seamstress was needed on set. In other shots, a model was transparently used, as the monster has all of the physical range of poor Stephen Hawking. It's tough to get too excited about the action, but some of the flying scenes do hold up pretty well.\nI needed so badly to see this Godzilla movie before I saw others, because of course one must see these things in order. Well, maybe not. Anyway, in this movie, the big fella is referred to as Gigantis. No, I'm not kidding. For reals, now. According to IMDb, this is either because Warner Brothers couldn't get permission to use the name (but it was okay to use in the title?) or because the producer of the American version wanted to give viewers the impression that this was an entirely new monster. Don't think he succeeded on that front."}

Young Samuel (Noah Wiseman) is seemingly haunted by a spirit that no one else can see, and of course no one else believes said spirit exists, least of all his mother Amelia (Essie Davis), who's struggling with the sudden, violent death of her husband and sees Samuel's \"ghost\" as Samuel's way of dealing with his own grief.\nThings kick into a higher gear when Samuel finds a book called The Babadook on his bookshelf. No kids' book this, The Babadook is about an out-to-get-you entity, complete with terrifying artwork and menacing words. It's so scary that Amelia can't stomach reading it all to Samuel. This ain't no ordinary book. The Babadook will come a-calling, first to the child in disguise and then to the kid's mother; then it'll just do it's haunting thing. The better to drive you insane, my dear.\nSamuel begins to act out. I got the impression that he'd been having behavioral issues (likely stemming from his dad's death), but once the book arrives, those issues increase infinitely in intensity. He misbehaves in school, at the park, and at his cousin's party; at the latter, he pushes his obnoxious, teasing cousin out of a treehouse, which enrages his aunt. So much for family and understanding, right? Eventually, Amelia is able to secure some medication for Samuel to keep him calm, but soon the spectre of the Babadook is in her head, too.\nA few points. First, even in recent memory there have been plenty of nobody-believes-I'm-being-haunted plots. Even with the children's book as a hook, this story is well worn indeed. But what really counts against it is that the kid is so over-the-top horrible from the beginning of the movie that it's nigh impossible to feel any real sympathy for him - until and unless the plot says it must be so. Samuel is, to put it bluntly, a real jerk. He's mean to everyone and disobeys his mom constantly.\nSure, we can explain this away by pointing to the dad's death (he died in an accident on the way to the hospital when Samuel was born) - but since he never knew his dad, it feels like the logic is twisting to suit a screenwriter's desperate needs. Samuel is so obnoxious that he spends about the first twenty minutes screaming \"MOM\" at the top of his lungs. I'm sure you parents out there can relate to how wonderfully appealing this sound is. It's so nice to be wanted.\nWhen Amelia herself inevitably becomes haunted by the Babadook as well, things get progressively worse. She's angry! She's normal! She's loving! She's cruel! She's seeing things! She's experiencing reality! It's a whirlwind of lazy, lazy writing. And, true to the trope, no one believes Amelia's claims that Something is happening - not the school, which clearly doesn't care about Samuel's well being; not her sister, who doesn't stop to consider that Amelia may truly need her help; not the Child Services people, who drop in unannounced and have no idea why this person is cleaning the kitchen because of a hole in the wall that doesn't exist. No one cares. Maybe that's because everyone involved saw the first part of the film, in which neither mother nor son comes off as particularly sympathetic.\nI got the impression that this movie merely needed a better director (than Jennifer Kent), writer (Kent), and actors (Davis and especially Wiseman). That's not asking too much, right? In the right hands, The Babadook would have been a stylish, Gothic psychological drama, but instead it's a run-of-the-mill plot sunk by aimless direction and a real lack of panache. There are just too many ludicrous scenes in this film to stomach. William Friedkin, of all people, claims that he's never seen a more terrifying film than this one; we can thus infer that Mr. Friedkin has never seen his own horror classic, The Exorcist."}

His yes men thought it was a great idea, until one of them pointed out that if the villain was the main character, they'd have to find a way to make him or her more appealing, someone the kids could root for, rather than against. And that leads us to Maleficent, in which the baddie from Sleeping Beauty is not a simple conduit of pure evil but a glad fairy wronged by by a human lover who perseveres despite her negative nature.\nFor those of you not up on your Disney, Maleficent was the wicked fairy who placed a curse on the infant Aurora, the daughter of the king who'd once held Maleficent's heart. The curse stated that on her sixteenth birthday, Aurora would be pricked by a spindle of a spinning wheel and then fall into a deep slumber that could only be broken by true love's kiss. Much of that plot structure is intact here, but we get to witness it all through the eyes of the fairy herself, Maleficent (Angelina Jolie).\nAt the story's outset, Maleficent is a winged fairy at one with the land and her ethereal companions. She laughs, they laugh. She protects them from harm, they laugh. It's all very symbiotic. And then one day a young boy wanders into the moors that the fairies call home - a boy named Stefan. They laugh a lot together, too, and they become close friends over the years. Then, as a young man, Stefan hopes to be named successor to the king whose realm surrounds the moors (a king who is dying thanks to the injuries inflicted upon him by Maleficient after his army attacked); the king says that whoever can defeat Maleficient for him will be the new ruler. So, despite the many years of laughter and love, Stefan decides to betray Maleficent, and that's when stuff gets truly deliciously dark.\nFor kids who saw the '59 animated movie, Maleficent was indeed a forbidding character but still manageable thanks to the cartoon nature of the film. Jolie's Maleficent is a little more terrifying. I don't know if kids today are just more jaded, but I think if I were eight years old I'd find this particular evil fairy the stuff nightmares are made of. Maleficent has large horns emerging from the top of her head, deep-red lipstick, and wicked, wicked eyes. She's not one to be trifled with. She also has what your English teacher might describe as \"verve.\" Or maybe you would, if you're British or pretentious, or both. Anyway, grown-up Maleficent not only wields very powerful magic, she's defiant, defensive, and scheming. Add to that the fact that she's been spurned, and you have a perfect storm for a whole lot of revenge being dished out.\nNow, in contrast to Sleeping Beauty, in which we witnessed Aurora's adventures through the prism of three bumbling (but well-intentioned) pixies, this trip is more about character growth. Look, it's a Disney film, so good things are probably going to carry the day. But it's not as if the well-known fairy tale is being treated as gospel, either. Because of the shift in perspective, some tropes common to Disney animated films are tweaked just a tad.\nJolie is amazing in a dominating (naturally) performance. Elle Fanning, as the teenaged Aurora, is fine in an understated (and understandably underwritten) role. Sharlto Copely plays Stefan, who transforms from a kind romantic to a caricature of Howard Hughes by the time the denouement arrives. (He's still pretty good, though.) But Jolie is the only actor who matters here, and this is a tour de force for her. It's a fun, intense role for her, and she doesn't dilute her character's ferocity by vamping. The visual effects, though, help mask the fact that this is a one-woman show. All of this adds up to a really well done live-action reimagining of a Disney classic, which is not a phrase one would have expected to type even five years ago."}

Switchblade Sisters promises to be a highly exploitative movie about a gritty girl gang, and it more than delivers on that promise. All of the indulgences of 1970s cinema are on florid display, from the earthy violence to the big, unkempt hair to those stereotypically bullhorn-loud outfits. This is no subtle film - it's brash trash.\nThe plot's as straight as Cher's hair (then, anyway): the aforementioned gang, called the Dagger Debs (they're sort of the ladies' auxiliary of an all-male gang, the Daggers), harasses an innocent waif named Maggie. Maggie, though, kicks ass, so the girls decide (after the usual you-must-prove-yourself act) to accept her as their own. At least their leader, Lace (Robbie Lee) does. Her #1 cohort, Patch (Monica Gayle) has plenty of reservations about the new meat, probably because she's jealous about how much attention Maggie (Joanne Nail) is getting from Lace. And that might be because Patch wears - go on, guess - an eyepatch. Kind of makes her look badass, but I bet she's a little self conscious about it, too. Fun fact: Quentin Tarantino was such a huge fan of this film that he modeled the character of Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) in the Kill Bill movies after Patch.\nAnyway, like even the most outrageous premises, one must not only suspend disbelief but expel it for the duration. All of the kids - who are indeed in their late teens or early twenties in real life - look like they're in their forties. Or maybe it's the hair. The Debs and the Daggers attend a high school where they rule the roost. I don't mean just stuff like taking nerds' lunch money. I mean gambling, prostitution, extortion, whatever it takes to get by, man. The principal, who's not really their pal despite his title, tells the head Dagger, Dominic (Asher Brauner) that Dom's chief gangster rival, Crabs (Chase Newhart) is transferring to the high school, and would Dom mind sharing a bit of the action? Ha, ha, it is to laugh, at both the proposition and Newhart's receding hairline. The Daggers try to play it cool but are attacked anyway by Crabs' gang. The big fight scene takes place in - no kidding - a roller skating rink, where members of both gangs zoom around the floor with the greatest of ease. That's when the good violence begins and things get messy, as in bloody, as in over the top.\nIt's hard to call this a terrible film, because it is exactly what it pretends to be. There's nothing highbrow about this production. Even some of the acting is pretty good, although there aren't any \"names\" among the cast. An Afterschool Special, this ain't. But would you believe, according to writer-director Jack Hill, this is actually loosely based on Othello? You can see the resemblance if you squint hard or have a terrific imagination. Switchblade Sisters has a rough-and-ready title, hot young women, lots of guns and knives and other implements of destruction, an insane fashion sense, and a whole lot of things getting smashed up. This is the paragon of drive-in movies, and if you don't know what those are, ask your grandfather."}

It's devilish in its simplicity and delivers pretty much exactly what its title and premise promise - a high-octane bundle of testosterone, adrenaline, and nerves that dominate what should have been a wholly unmemorable action movie.\nFace it, if this had come out in the 1980s, it'd have starred Steven Seagal and an army of indistinguishable villains and damsels. Instead it came out this century, and although Jason Statham is no Mel Gibson, he's also no Steven Seagal. Here, he's notorious hit man Chev Chelios, who's just been poisoned by a rival baddie with a designer drug that will kill him in about an hour - or less, if his heart rate slows down too much. So it's kind of like Speed, only with a heart instead of a bus. Kind of.\nChelios is targeted by a guy named Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo), who's taking revenge for Chelios's killing of a local mob chief. While Chelios is sleeping, Verona manages to sneak in and inject our hero with a Chinese synthetic. He then helpfully leaves a DVD that informs Chelios of his plight.\nAt the advice of his doctor (Dwight Yoakam), who's out of town, Chelios strives to keep his heart rate elevated. He takes cops on a chase through a mall, just like in The Blues Brothers! He parkours! He runs through a hospital! He steals a cop's motorcycle! He has public sex! He's insane! Amy Smart plays his girlfriend, Eve. Eve isn't terribly bright (she has no idea Chev is a hit man) and probably is afflicted by ADD, but she's nice and can be a little dangerous, too. Smart was a, uh, good choice to play the role. Thank goodness Tara Reid didn't get involved here.\nThe pace is frantic, with a lot of racing about on foot and in vehicles. There are slow-mo shots, rapid-fire shots, close-ups of ultra-violence and copious blood. Heck, compared with all of that, the sex scene in Chinatown is rather tame. And Chelios, with poison coursing through his veins, is in vehicular accidents and fistfights galore but keeps on ticking. Why? Because he's Chev Chelios, that's why.\nCrank is a super-stylish homage to those 1980s action movies, and the stern acting by Statham - wisely letting the comic moments occur around him, rather than trying to actually instigate them - pushes this one over the top. In a good way. Awesome movie for the real action junkies among us."}

Although the aesthetics are definitely pleasing, there is a lack of character development and a sometimes inscrutable storyline. In all, though, this is an intriguing tale.\nIt all starts when a hulking, cloaked figure named Ink steals into young Emma's room one night and tries to make off with her, only to run into a small squadron of good guys called Storytellers. Ink gets away, but a small drum he uses to transmit a secret code (which allows him to return to a different realm.\nInk wants to use Emma (played with great verve by Quinn Hunchar) as a way to ingratiate himself with the Incubi, beings that directly provide mortals of the real world with nightmares (contrasted with the Storytellers, who furnish people with sweet dreams). Ink is under the belief that he can overcome his overwhelming guilt and shame by becoming an Incubus himself. He does not reckon with a Storyteller named Liev (Jessica Duffy), who willingly surrenders to Ink in order to save Emma.\nBut, lest you think this is something akin to kid-fantasy movies like Labyrinth and Willow, there's a deeper theme to all of this other than those of atonement and reconciliation. Everything is connected, a sentiment to which good-guy Jacob (Jeremy Make), a blind Pathfinder (his title is sort of explanatory), certainly subscribes. If you want to prevent a particular future, you must find an item in the sequence leading up to that future - and then break the flow of events.\nFor me, Ink was one of those movies that seemed to make little sense at first. Gradually, though, I began to grasp just how fraught with meaning it truly was. So many questions occurred: Why is Emma so important to everyone? Who is Liev, and what makes her so special? Why do Incubi wear those creepy electronic monitors over their faces? Why is Ink so grotesque? And then, like finally being able to fold a fitted sheet, the battle comes to a remarkably satisfying conclusion. We don't learn everything, but the light shed in the final scenes is highly gratifying. The viewer may slap his or her head, wondering why they didn't piece it all together earlier, but that's the beauty of the screenplay by Jamin Winans (who also directed). The only real debit is that the movie doesn't delve too deeply into the motives or emotions of any of the characters, even the leads. Ink seems to only scratch the surface of a very intriguing mythology, that of the beings who fight to wrest away our souls by way of our dreams."}

In fact, there are no ducklings; the title is figurative. What we have here is a fine mystery coated with a sleek veneer of horrific blood, from one of the Italian masters, Lucio Fulci.\nIn this movie, a series of child murders has a small town in a tizzy - they blame the local witch, but the constabulary believes someone else is behind the mayhem. A reporter named Martelli (Tomas Milian), with sharp eyes and keen insight, lends support to the police, who are uncharacteristically receptive to his opinions. In any event, though, the killer remains at large, even when the citizenry has run out of obvious culprits.\nThe local witch, Magiara (Florinda Bolkan), is seen creating three dolls out of clay and inserting multiple pins into them. Is she behind the murders? What about dim-witted handyman Guiseppe (Vito Passeri), who had been relentlessly mocked by three of the boys? What about cosmopolitan Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet), who's hiding out in the village thanks to drug charges she encountered in Milan? None of these three are paragons of Catholic behavior, and of course the Catholic Church is, shall we say, Almighty.\nThere be blood in this movie that's not about ducks at all, and that's what Fulci's known for, anyway. It'd be much more shocking if there were no gore, really. But although the blood is anything but subtle, it is parceled out as if there were a national shortage. (Come to think of it, there's always a shortage of blood, according to the Red Cross.) Not only that, but much of the bloody violence occurs late in the movie, as the mystery is wrapping up. And it's a pretty suspenseful, too, as long as you don't ponder the possible suspects too long.\nMilian is very good, as are Bolkan and Irene Papas (as the mother of the village priest), although the fact that the version I saw was dubbed into English, rather than subtitled. But the words and the facial expressions seemed to match, so it was a darn good dubbing. There was occasional histrionic overacting, but overall this hit the mark."}

Funny side note - all those years of watching Looney Toons, and I never recognized the references to Lenny from this film.\nOf Mice and Men is about to wandering workers, Lenny and George, played respectively by Chaney and Meredith.

They've been traveling together for some time, with the latter helping the former out of trouble when his simple nature betrays him.\nHere, they've been hired on as farm hands, toting bales of hay while dreaming of someday owning their own ranch and breeding rabbits. The son of the ranch owner, Curley Jackson (Bob Steele) is a short man with a short temper who takes an instant dislike to the looming Lenny. One of the chief hands is named Slim (Charles Bickford), who's a nice, laid-back fella, kind of the polar opposite of Curley.\nMost viewers probably read the book in English class and therefore already know the tragic ending. But, as luck would have it, some of us didn't. Either way, I won't go into detail about that portion of the plot except to note that the ever-mounting conflicts in the story center around Lenny's childlike mind and manner and that Curley's wife Mae (Betty Field) is no help in the easing-tensions department.\nDirector Lewis Milestone squeezes a lot of blood from Chaney and Meredith. It's not surprising that this role led to Chaney's getting several likable-monster roles (he'd appear in The Wolf Man a couple of years later). For Meredith, this was probably his best role until playing The Penguin in TV's Batman. But I can't say enough about their performances.\nSo should you read the book or see the movie? Yes. Yes, you should. And then, you should write a 400-word essay about how the two compare. Please submit them to me by April 30, 2015."}

The Black Sleep straddles the two eras very nicely, with a simple spooky plot set in an old castle with a mad scientist, and the cast is a real dream team.\nBasil Rathbone plays Sir Joel Cadman, a doctor of some repute, who has invented a medicine called nind andhera, which puts the patient into such a deep slumber that he or she appears to be dead. Sir Joel does this in order to claim the corpse and operate on the person's brain. With these experiments, he hopes to find out how to cure his comatose wife's brain tumor. Got all that? The story begins with Sir Joel slipping the medicine to a convicted murder, a Dr. Gordon Ramsey (Herbert Rudley); when the man is discovered dead in his cell, a shifty-looking gypsy (Akim Tamiroff) claims the body and brings it to Sir Joel. But he doesn't wish to operate on Ramsey - he wishes for Ramsey to assist him. Even mad scientists need some help, you know.\nPresent at Sir Joel's castle/estate (complete with hidden entrances and staircases) are some interesting characters: Mungo (Lon Chaney, Jr.), who used to be a doctor but is now more of an Igor/Quasimodo hybrid; Casimir (Bela Lugosi), who's mute; Bohemond (John Carradine), who thinks he's a crusading knight; and a Mr. Curry (Tor Johnson), who has a connection of his own with Dr. Ramsey.\nWatching Tamiroff's character Odo, I couldn't help but think he exhibited mannerisms similar to Peter Lorre. Sure enough, Lorre had been offered the role first, but ultimately the filmmakers couldn't meet his price tag.\nSure, there's no Vincent Price, Boris Karloff, Peter Cushing, or Christopher Lee, but that's still an impressive list. And the thing of it is, they all make this work. Rathbone is a great condescending, self-absorbed, driven science-type, and even though Lugosi and Chaney, Jr. don't speak (seriously), they own their scenes as well. This was actually Lugosi's final film, too; he was nominally in Edward D. Wood Jr.'s Plan 9 from Outer Space, but since he died during filming, archive footage and a stand-in were used instead. He and Tor Johnson had been in Bride of the Monster (Wood again) the previous year, and Lugosi and Rathbone had been in Son of Frankenstein back in 1939.\nThe Black Sleep is a terrific throwback to those dusty-castle movies, complete with monsters (hint - man is the real monster!), pseudo science, and a damsel in distress. See it for some old-school scares; see if for Tamiroff's comic relief; see it if you want to feel nostalgic for horror legends."}

And quite red, for that matter. This is fairly typical low-budget 1950s sci-fi right here, complete with shoddy effects and no more than a passing knowledge of science, or even the laws of physics. It's about a manned mission to Mars in which stuff goes wrong, which is a theme that shows up even in today's movies; here, it's told mainly in flashback by one of the survivors.\nRocketship MR-1 (you know, for Mars Rocket 1) blasts off with four crew members on board - Tom O'Bannion (Gerald Mohr), Iris Ryan (Naura Hayden), Theodore Gettell (Les Tremayne), and Sam Jacobs (Jack Kruschen). A couple of days later, they land on Mars. To put that in perspective, if the fastest spacecraft around today left while Mars and Earth were closest to each other, it would arrive at Mars in a little over a month. That's if it's an unmanned craft, as the human body can't take super-duper fast speeds. But, okay, this was 1959, so we'll just have to accept that the writers were spitballing some ideas and didn't care if they fudged some numbers.\nContact is lost a couple of months after departure from Earth, and suddenly the MR-1 is detected in orbit around Earth (yeah, I know); immediately, the science types spring into action and return the rocket to terra firma by remote control. Which is totally a thing, at least in science fiction. Anyway, Iris staggers out of the ship and is essentially in shock, while one of her crew mates is rushed to an operating table with some green thing on his arm. It's up to amnesiac Iris to fill in the blanks for the doctors, who for some reason need her to explain just what in tarnation happened before they can do anything.\nThis is where the flashback comes in, as Iris is hypnotized. We learn, in quick order, that the ship did land on Mars. Upon landing, the crew note only vegetation - no, as they said, life. Plants aren't life, people! And if someone from 2015 told this crew that plants are, indeed, life, the answer would be along the lines of \"well, not REAL life!\" Anyway, the plants are there, and they appear to be completely still. This unnerves everyone, particularly Iris, who as the lone female is prone to emotional outbursts, not like the manly and/or thoughtful men on board.\nMuch of the movie was shot in Cinemagic, a process that was supposed to simulate hand-drawn animation. It doesn't really work to that extent, but the scenes on Mars do have a very strong reddish hue to them. Seems appropriate. But here are a few other interesting bits that this laugher provided. 1) while the crew is on board their ship and looking out of the portholes, the sky changes from red to blue and back again between scenes. I'm not sure if the blue was supposed to mean daytime and the red was night, but even in 1959 people knew why the sky looks blue to us. 2) While on Mars, the crew encounters what they call a lake (although it's massive enough that \"ocean\" would have been the first thing to pop into my mind), so they come back later with a - wait for it - inflatable raft. Just the kind of thing you'd take onboard a spaceship that needs to be as lightweight as possible to escape Earth's gravitational pull. And then 3) about that gravity. The ship itself appears to have plenty of it, as no one's floating around. Understandable, since it would probably break the budget to turn on the antigravity in 1959. Mars also has plenty of it. In fact, it's the same gravity Earth has! Neat little coincidence.\nBut sure, this was 1959, and the extent of outer-space exploration was...what, Yuri Gagarin? We can let them slide on a lot of this science stuff. Science is for nerds, right? Let's see this crew take on the aliens! Which they do, and spoiler alert, the aliens aren't at all pleased we're on Mars. After a while, you can kind of see their point.\nThe Angry Red Planet is a relic of its era; it's light on facts, light on humor (other than the forced or stereotypical kinds), light on drama, and just plain light overall. Even the tone is light. I did get a kick out of the prehistoric Mission Control, which consisted of a bunch of people crowded around one terminal. Who knows how big the mountain was that housed the actual computer. Gerald Mohr, who plays the crew's commander, is sort of a poor man's Peter Graves and looks like a poor man's Humphery Bogart, which is why he was hired. Kruschen, who plays Sam the warrant officer (why?), is your garden variety comic relief. He's even from Brooklyn, which means he's got your back and just let him at those aliens! Tremayne, who had had a long, illustrious career in radio by this time, is the requisite \"thoughtful scientist\" on board; Iris is also a scientist, but everything she says is dismissed, because she's a woman."}

(Yes, it's an analogue to the Vietnam War.) The catch is that Mr. Freedom is more than willing to maim, rape, and murder anyone who doesn't agree with his particular brand of bringing true democracy to the masses, which makes him a bit more sociopathic than heroic. But them's the breaks, I suppose.\nMr. Freedom (John Abbey) is in the employ of some faceless secret organization headed by, of course, Dr. Freedom (Donald Pleasance). The doctor sends the mister overseas to help the resistance, as if WW II were ongoing. The idea is that if the Reds capture France, then by the domino effect the rest of Europe will fall to the Iron Curtain - which here includes China. So how does Mr. Freedom hope to accomplish this? With guns, fists, and good ol' American know-how. His French contact Marie-Madeline (Delphine Seyrig) introduces him to the ragtag crew who hopes to forestall Communism - but could there be a spy among their midst? His costume looks like a combination of NFL player and Robocop. Soon all of the freedom fighters are similarly attired, which makes the whole outfit look like rejects from American Gladiators. Mr. Freedom has no time for nuance; he punches, shoots, kicks, and kills anything that seems anti-American. Seems legit. He's surrounded by stereotypes masquerading as symbols - China is represented by a giant dragon costume, of course. The movie, like its purported protagonist, ain't subtle. Mr. Freedom is sort of like the inbred half-cousin to Captain America; all machismo, no smarts, no figurative vision, and too damn angry.\nThis was directed by one William Klein, whose IMDb page informs me directed quite a few documentaries - and not too many features. His fiction films were typically subversive, meant to satirize known conventions, whether they were the American stance on the war in Vietnam or the fashion industry. I'm not sure how well it was received in 1969, but Klein was so fearful about getting it shown anywhere that he opened it at the Avignon Festival. He was probably wise to do so. The movie is overbearing, crass, and pretty repulsive, even as satire. Phillipe Noiret, Yves Montand, and Simone Signoret each show up in brief roles or cameos, but I'd be willing to wager none was proud of it. Even worse, Abbey gives about as one dimensional a performance as possible; he plays Mr. Freedom as if he were the ROTC guy from Animal House, only not for laughs. Even the sexual scenes are drab. This is a colossal bomb.\nThe overarching trouble with Mr. Freedom the movie is that the character's schtick runs thin about five minutes in and yet intensifies as the plot progresses. It's not long before he's fighting not just Commies but the French who aren't actively fighting with the freedom fighters, and later all of the French. I'm not sure if that's a commentary on how Americans overall view the French, but there you go. And, of course, since this is during the Cold War, there's a threat of using The Bomb to solve problems. You can probably guess Mr. Freedom's stance on that topic."}

By recalling that it's a Mario Bava movie. Bava had a prolific career as Italy's horrormeister, a progenitor of sorts of Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci. By 1966, Bava had made such minor classics as Black Sunday, Black Sabbath, and Planet of the Vampires. Bava's stylish movies weren't always Oscar material, but they sure looked good. Kill, Baby...Kill is no exception.\nIn a small, secluded town in 18th century Europe, a Dr. Eswai (Giacomo Rossi-Stuart) arrives via coach. Like Renfield in Bram Stoker's Dracula, Eswai's coachman refuses to even enter the town, let alone get close to the castle where the doctor is to meet the local inspector (Piero Lulli). Eswai has been called by the inspector to conduct an autopsy on a possible murder victim. Trouble is, the townspeople don't want the good doctor to touch the body, even going so far as to try burying it and to attack Eswai as a warning.\nWhy? Because they all feel that the town is under a terrible curse placed on them by a young girl who died a good twenty years earlier. Apparently, the girl died in plain view of an unhelpful citizenry, and now, through her sorceress mother, is avenging herself. Anyone who sees young Melissa is doomed to die a horrible death, usually at their own hands. So you can see how some may be a little skittish about letting Dr. Eswai cut the latest body open. Don't want to irritate the ghost, you know.\nThe movie needed a romantic interest for Eswai, so enter nurse Monica (Erika Blanc), who was born and raised in the town but moved away at a young age - she's present just to check in on the graves of her parents, so she agrees to witness the autopsy, with the prodding of the inspector.\nAs I noted, the movie is characteristically stylish, with an almost visceral feel to it. The blood is there, but it's less copious than it would be in later Bava movies, like Twitch of the Death Nerve. One shot I loved in particular appears to be of a diorama of the town's main passage. The camera swoops in, and then back out, and then in, and then out, and each time it's like walking into a 3D painting. The shot is meant to imitate the perspective of a child on a swing, and it's very effective. There's also a mind-bending scene in which the doctor pursues Monica, who's being carried away; no matter how quickly he moves, he never seems to gain on his target. It's a dizzying scene.\nAlthough there are some of the basic cornerstones of the genre - isolated town, superstitious villagers, a damsel in distress, a curse, ghosts - Bava's direction and cinematography (uncredited) mark this as a cut above your typical mid-1960s old-school horror feature. The conclusion may never really be in doubt, but the journey's an entertaining one."}

That's because back in the day, divorced women were considered damaged goods, and upstanding families would steer well clear of such flighty harlots. Easy Virtue's tagline asks \"Can she be blamed for a past she didn't create?\" And the answer is yes, because she did create her past when she started making eyes at the man painting her portrait. But perhaps I am getting a little ahead of myself.\nLarita Filton (Isabel Jeans) is married to an unnamed guy. Well, he probably has a name, but the movie doesn't tell us. Anyway, they're rich, and she's having her portrait done by a professional artist. One day the artist notices marks on Larita's wrist, and she mentions that her husband sometimes drinks too much. Thus a relationship is born, at least as far as they went in the 1920s, which meant it's possible Larita and the artist smooched once. Anyway, one fine day the husband comes home to find the two of them in an embrace. A gun is presented, and a shot is fired, and the artist dies. This is all told to us in flashback at the divorce trial, where the jury quite naturally finds in favor of the husband. Larita is shamed and shunned.\nShe finds herself chillaxing on the Mediterranean, and a chance encounter with a tennis ball leads Larita to meet John Whittaker (Robin Irvine), who's from a well-to-do family himself. They romance, yadda yadda, and soon they're wed. He brings her home to meet his parents and his two sisters for dinner. The stern matriarch is fairly sure she recognizes Larita, and eventually she pieces it together. Haughty hilarity ensues.\nThis is a silent film, obviously very early in The Master's career, and much more of a melodrama than a thriller with a twist. There's no twist, and because there are few sight gags one must rely on the intermittent title cards to follow the mouthed dialog. That's all well and good, but there was just too much predictability afoot, and the quality of the print did the movie no favors, either. That all makes Easy Virtue a curio in Hitch's long, long career, and little more."}

It's not for a lack of trying, so to speak, but the overarching problem is that the movie is essentially a carbon copy of all the slasher/home invasion movies in the world and contributes very little of note. I suppose the killers' masks, taken from the heads of giant stuffed animals, is the extent of the film's originality.\nCory Morgan (Robin Dunne) and his new bride Sarah (Katharine Isabelle) arrive at Cory's summer home (secluded, of course), with Cory's son Liam (Peter DaCunha) in tow. The kid resents his stepmom a little, because she's not Mom. Mom's dead, in case you were wondering. Unfortunately, that fact has almost no bearing on the plot, which feels like a tremendous waste of opportunity. At any rate, when the Morgans arrive at the house they quickly learn that squatters have been there very recently - there's spoiled food left out and some blood on the wall. They call the cops, and good ol' Office Hawkings (Stephen McHattie) tells them that teenagers probably hung out there and had a party or something. Doesn't explain the blood too much, but the Morgans don't press him for more info. Just another kindly old officer of the law lending a homespun helping hand, is all.\nDuring their first night in the house, Sarah awakes to a noise downstairs, which happens in most horror films anyway. When she and Cory investigate, they find nothing out of the ordinary - except that little Liam is now missing. And thus begins endless searching (for the boy) and fleeing (from the crazy cult who snatched him and is right next door) that comprises basically the balance of the movie. Run into forest, be pursued by masked lunatic, fire off every flare in your road flare gun so you can see where you're going, escape into your house, get attacked by another masked lunatic, run out of the house and into a muddy stream where you fend off the attacker, and so on.\nIsabelle looks great and appears capable of being a damsel in distress. Dunne is a little more lackluster. Young DaCunha's performance felt more authentic than that of any of the adults. But what made this film particularly maddening were the little hints of backstory that are never really resolved. For example, when Cory does find Liam and confronts the kidnapping maniacs, it's strongly implied that he (Cory) knows who these people are, knows their history, knows why they've chosen poor Liam. Do we, the audience, get to discover this as well? We do not. And maybe it would have helped if we did, because a gentle, plausible twist would have been welcome over the generic, often listless storyline.\nTorment is not so bad it's good. It's a mediocre entry in a field that's already very overloaded with mediocrity. There isn't even all that much blood, thereby depriving those who love a good gorefest from getting their money's worth. So, no gore, a thin plot, lousy acting, and and overwhelming sense of pointlessness all add up to a movie that's just not worth your time."}

A trio of astronauts is sent by NASA to the Red Planet in hopes of finding sentient life. Or life of any kind. To paraphrase the noted mathematician Ian Malcolm, although the planet appears to be barren, life finds a way. Meanwhile, the European Space Agency has sent up an artificially intelligent robot in an effort to beat the Americans.\nThis is a stunning animated opus - yes, I said animated - that uses a technique similar to rotoscoping; director Geoff Marslett developed the technique specifically for this film, and it makes the movie look much more like an actual graphic novel. The technique is a real treat. Much like rotoscoping, for this technique scenes are shot as live action and then converted to animation, lending a realistic, colorful look and feel.\nThe crew is composed of Hank Morrison (Paul Gordon), the captain and pilot; Dr. Casey Cook (Zoe Dean), the scientist; and Charlie Brownsville (Mark Duplass), who's, well, the backup. The redundancy may not fly in real life (no pun intended), but here we can suspend our disbelief. After all, this is science fiction, with a comic bent.\nThe astronauts deal with the boredom of space travel, and in particular the well-named Charlie bemoans the fact that he's much more expendable than his crewmates. In fact, when the trio does arrive at Mars, Morrison and Cook are to head down to the planet in a shuttle while Charlie figuratively keeps the motor running. Morrison is the brooding type, harboring a secret; Cook is the imaginative, energetic type, quickly drawn to the everyman Charlie. And if hanging around doing nothing while the so-called real astronauts do their astronaut thing, Charlie has been directed by NASA to give live interviews to an Entertainment Tonight-like duo (Liza Weil and James Kochalka) that are designed to promote the expensive trip.\nNow, although Charlie has been deemed redundant (by the NASA chief Shep, played by Howe Gelb), he's actually a former hero. Did space walks and such, and was really good at them. So maybe he's not completely useless, and we can forgive NASA for tossing him in the ship. And what a ship! Although there's just the standard astronaut meals and accommodations, there's also a huge (!) garden for seeding Mars. This garden contains a pool, presumably to keep the flora watered, but a pool nonetheless. Pretty darn awesome spaceship, if you ask me. It might be worth noting that the movie, released in 2010, is set in the future - 2015. Okay, maybe the film makers missed this prediction.\nBut this isn't a typical sci-fi film - there's philosophy afoot! Why do we want to discover? How do we react to what's out there? What is the worth of knowledge of the stars? All good questions, and thankfully the movie doesn't sit us down and lecture to us on each subject. In fact, the movie's pretty low key, with only a few action sequences - one of which does indeed involve a space walk. And the point of view we get to see isn't just that of the astronauts, because a probe sent by the ESA five years prior is, long thought to be lost, is somehow still active, taking pictures and recording video - just not transmitting. It, too, holds some interesting secrets.\nTo some, Mars the movie may seem like just an experiment, something a film-school grad student knocked out for the fun of it. I would disagree. The movie both looks good and sounds good. The plot, although secondary to the characters and the visuals, is strong and open ended. Unlike most sci-fi stories told by Hollywood, this one offers no neat-and-tidy answers to the problems it brings up. And in this case, the ambiguity meshes very nicely with the conflicting emotions of the humans in the movie. Besides, any movie with Kinky Friedman as the president of the United States can't be all bad."}

This South Korean horror drama is definitely not for the faint of heart, but it's very stylish and visceral. It has a lot of heart...and guts, and brains, and decapitations.\nKim Soo-hyeon (Byung-hun Lee) takes a leave of absence from his job and sets out to find his girl's killer. With help from the girl's father, Soo-hyeon's retired chief, the agent is able to narrow the list to four suspects. He hits paydirt with number three - Jang Kyung-chul (Choi Min-sik), a horrific psychopath who kills for the hell of it and has cannibals for friends. Did I mention this isn't for the faint of heart? But when Soo-hyeon gets a hold of Kyung-chul, killing him or otherwise bringing him to justice isn't near the top of his to-do list. What follows is a grisly cat-playing-with-its-food game: catch and release, catch and release.\nThis isn't about doing the right thing anymore, at least not if you're a normal, rational human being. It's about doing unto others as they themselves have already done did to others. Well, something like that. But Soo-hyeon and Kyung-chul have underestimated each other's tenacity and resilience - as well as the ability of either to disregard morality and collateral damage. Which is something you'd expect the veteran killer to do, but not really the secret agent man.\nChoi Min-sik starred as the victim in the classic Oldboy (not the Spike Lee abomination, the original), but here he's a nasty piece of work, a man with no problem with rape, murder, pedophilia, and so on. Say what one might about Kyung-chul's evil attitude, he's certainly not interesting. Never a dull moment with either of these characters, even as gallons of blood are spilled and bones are cracked and heads splintered. All in the name of good, clean revenge! I Saw the Devil is a transcendentally violent trip, with just the right amount of over-the-top horror that South Korean cinema has come to be known for. It's an unrated film, and it's almost two and a half hours long, and time seems to zip right by. Certainly not for all tastes, particularly those of a squeamish nature."}

Beatty's Joe Collins is cool and methodical, and Hawn is a true delight as Dawn Divine, although the movie suffers from a lengthy run time and an ending that seems sort of a meaningless afterthought.\nCollins works for a bank in Hamburg, Germany that is on the cutting edge of technological security. Among other things, the bank has - get this! - a 24-hour closed-circuit camera inside its safe, the better to monitor would-be evil-doers. Much is made of this awesome camera. Kind of makes one pine for the days when security cameras were a new thing.\nAt any rate, Collins and Divine have picked out three nefarious marks - a corrupt sergeant (Scott Brady), a Vegas mobster (Robert Webber), and a drug dealer (Arthur Brauss) - each of whom has deposited dirty money into a safe-deposit box in the bank. These boxes are much as they are today, although the bank employees very pointedly do not get to see what is in them; privacy, you see, is a big selling point for the bank wishing to attract more and more foreign interests.\nThe plan is to move the monies from the three boxes to Divine's own safety box. Plenty of planning goes into this, and it culminates with a wonderfully tense scene in which Joe, trapped in the safe, attempts the exchange. It's only a matter of time, though, before the various baddies discover what's happened, and there's a long, long chase scene - mostly on foot! - that eats up a chunk of film near the end of the movie.\nHawn is at her giggly, risqu\u00e9 best (this would be during her Laugh-In days), and Beatty stays true to type as the Man with the Plan, the cool cat. I particularly enjoyed how anxious Hawn's Divine is at her own role in the heist - for a phone call she must make, she has her lines written out longhand, and yet she still can only whisper them to the bank's manager, played by Gert Frobe (Auric Goldfinger).\nThe ending felt like it was lacking something, perhaps some panache or some cohesion. It's almost as if someone woke up in postproduction and realized there was no actual climax and then hastily wrote one in. In fact, after reading a synopsis on IMDb, I wondered if I'd seen the same ending - interestingly, the IMDb synopsis made even less sense than the one I saw.\nFinally, there's the issue of the editing and/or direction - the former was too choppy, the latter too rapid. When your movie features an intricate plan, maybe it's best not to rush through every step, forcing your viewers to keep up. Even when we could keep up, it seemed as if some plot elements were missing entirely, leading to many questions left unanswered."}

The Maxman was his last non-talkie. And, like most of the Master's silent films, it's decent but not as clever as his later movies. It's a love triangle movie, really, which puts it firmly in the realm of the melodrama and pretty far from scares and chills.\nPete (Carl Brisson) is a down-on-his-luck fisherman. He may not pull down a great paycheck, but he does have Kate (Anny Ondra), the beautiful daughter of Pete's landlord, Caesar (Randle Ayrton). Pete and Kate seem to really be into each other, and Pete plans to ask for her hand in marriage by way of her father, whose approval is mandatory. But he can't quite bring himself to ask the old man himself, so he asks his best friend Philip (Malcolm Keen), a lawyer, to speak for him. But Caesar will have none of it, seeking a man of actual means for his daughter, and he kicks Pete out. But that's okay, because Pete plans to sail to \"foreign parts\" and seek his fortune, and then they'll all be sorry! Pete asks Philip to look after Kate while he's gone, and Philip obliges. But soon he and Kate are falling madly in love with each other, which may complicate things when Pete returns. Suddenly - no spoiler! - news arrives that Pete has died while at sea. Now what do Kate and Philip do? They've kept the nature of their relationship a secret so far, but are they now free to bring it out into the open? In addition, Philip is a fast-rising barrister there on the Isle of Man, and he is line to be named the new Deemster (chief judge on the island). Will the revelation derail his career? This is one of those silent films that demands attention really be paid. There are some title cards, but there will be plenty of times when the viewer must make a reasonable inference of the dialog. There are, in fact, two scenes in which someone mouths something that isn't noted at all in a title card - and each instance is quite important to the plot. One must deduce their nature by checking the reaction of the other characters in the scene.\nThe Manxman (i.e., man from the Isle of Man) does feature three fine performances and is a solid representation of films of the era.

In it, our former Viking nebbish Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is now the hero of the town of Berk, which is still ruled by his dad, Stoick (Gerard Butler). Peace reigns in Berk; instead of endless fighting and pillaging on the part of the marauding Vikes, dragons and men are friends of a sort. Even the most hardened of savages favors the flying reptiles.\nHiccup knows that his dad wants very badly to be the next chief of their Viking tribe, but he himself doesn't want to follow in those large footsteps. While scouting with his own dragon, Toothless, Hiccup discovers an island that's part land, part ice - in that there are huge shards of ice skewering the island and the domiciles. Then he - and his gal pal Astrid (America Ferrera) and her dragon - are trapped, partly so that Hiccup can find out more about this new place. And it quickly comes out that the band of men on the island have been attacked several times by dragons and that they themselves are, in fact, dragon trappers. They're catching dragons to serve in a dragon army ruled by Drago (Djimon Hounsou), who's naturally out to rule the world.\nThe Dreamworks animation is fine - as good as in the previous movie, anyway - but more importantly the voice characterizations are great. In one fun scene, Astrid pokes fun at Hiccup's speech mannerisms, which of course mimic those of the real-life Jay Baruchel: a lot of shrugging and hand-waving. Jack Black, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Jonah Hill, and Kristen Wiig voice Hiccup's friends, and Kit Harrington (Jon Snow on Game of Thrones, who knows nothing) plays a duplicitous dragon trapper. Oh yeah, and Cate Blanchett's there as well.\nThe movie and its predecessor are based on a series of books by Cressida Crowell, and there are plans to make a third film. No surprise there - the sequel did great box office and was nominated for an Oscar for Best Animated Feature. And while the effects and action make for a wholly entertaining movie, there's some beautiful, quieter moments, between parent and son, girl and boy, boy and dragon.

You know, they all have an \"arrangement.\" But it's much more of an existential, mid-life-crisis movie. Kirk Douglas stars as ad exec Eddie Anderson who has an epiphany after wrecking his car in a New York City tunnel, leading him to reevaluate his priorities. Deborah Kerr stars as his wife, Florence, and Faye Dunaway is the iconoclastic girlfriend, Gwen.\nTold from Eddie's point of view, the film moves back and forth between the present and various earlier moments in the man's life, including his childhood as the son of a Persian rug dealer (Richard Boone) and his earlier days at the ad agency, where he meets Gwen, a looker whose opinions are valued by the company's president. Eddie is, by the present day and according to him, locked into a strict course of by-the-book, humdrum listlessness. Although the movie doesn't use the specific phrase, Eddie wants to drop out of society - this during a time in real life when people were doing exactly that. (It was the late 1960s, after all.) A year prior to the release of The Arrangement, Douglas' best buddy Burt Lancaster appeared in a similar movie, called The Swimmer. That one was based on a John Cheever story; The Arrangement is based on director Elia Kazan's own best-selling novel, which was widely panned by critics. As was the movie adaptation - some thought that Douglas' performance was a little flat and superficial. I think that's nonsense. Douglas is terrific in a very meaty role. But even better than Kirk Douglas are his two leading ladies. Dunaway is unforgettable as the independent Gwen; this was about two years after her breakthrough role in Bonnie and Clyde, so it was a bit of a boon to get her on board. She knocks this role out of the park. And Kerr, who had been making movies for a couple of decades but looked every bit as lovely and elegant as an ingenue. Hers, like Dunaway's and Douglas's, is also a multilayered role."}

He's instantly smitten; she's obviously unstable. It's true love at first sight, at least from his standpoint. Eventually, Pam comes around, and they get married. But as I've already noted twice in this paragraph, she has some mental issues. Whether it's hiding from Chris' parents when they come to visit or threatening to kill herself with one of Chris' many firearms, Pam clearly needs some kind of help. Even rehab, provoked by habitual tardiness to the research lab (!) that employs her, isn't the cure.\nWe know within five minutes of the movie's start that this won't end well for either Chris or Pam, as they're in the process of being caught by the FBI after a robbery. The rest of the story is told in flashback, so the focus is really on how the pair got to the point of robbing banks, and successfully.\nNeither of the leads stands out here. Perry is almost unrecognizable, sporting a standard-issue cop mustache, and his character is alternately clever and stupid. Chris sticks by his dotty wife even when it's clear her actions are having a severely detrimental effect on his work, family, and friends. Judd fares a little better, but not much. Judd is eye candy that can actually act, and she does an acceptable job with a complex character. Still and all, Pam is so far around the bend that it's hard to relate to her. Sure, being unpredictable is generally a good trait for a character to have, but if there's not even a passing nod to coherence, then it's all for naught. You may as well have Pam twirling a hula hoop with her neck while dressed as a pirate for all the sense her character seems to have.\nNot much to see here, just a flat, toneless story of two unlucky saps who, frankly, got what they had coming anyway."}

In human form, he's actually Larry Talbot, and for the sake of plot expediency he already knows he turns into a wolf when the moon is full. Which it is, during almost the entire movie. After killing a couple of guys, Talbot winds up in a sanatorium run by Dr. Mannering (Patric Knowles). Talbot wants desperately to die so he can finally rid himself of this horrible curse, and the old gypsy woman (Maria Ouspenskaya) who he knew from The Wolf Man tells him only one guy can really help - Dr. Frankenstein himself.\nOnly the good doctor's dead, dead as a doornail, killed when villagers blew up his castle in Son of Frankenstein. These same villagers are right angry that Talbot and the gypsy even bring up the Frankenstein name, for some reason. Anyway, it's not until the movie's nearly half over that we finally see the grand titular meeting, when Talbot stumbles among the ruins of the castle and finds the monster, encased in a block of ice. (It's in an ice cave, although I'm not sure where all the ice came from.) After thawing out the monster (played by an unrecognizable Bela Lugosi), Talbot searches in vain for the doctor's diary. But luckily, Frankenstein's daughter is still around, the Baroness Elsa (Ilona Massey), and she helps Talbot find the diary. Then it's up to Dr. Mannering to hook up Dr. Frankenstein's old apparatus and - get this - switch the wires so that instead of giving life to the Monster, energy is drained off of both him and Talbot. Things don't go as planned, strange as it may seem.\nThere's plenty of that old Universal atmosphere, although the Monster's lurching gait looks kind of silly. Here's why it's not, though: he's lurching because he's blind. He's blind because the mind of Ygor in one of the earlier films was switched with that of the Monster. That's why Frank's Monster knows where some of the doctor's research is and why he lumbers about with his arms outstretched, as if he just needed a hug. Here's another fun fact - when the villagers are carrying a just-killed girl down the street, demanding justice, they're all carrying torches. Torches that are, yes, unlit. Even when they're searching the forest for the Wolf Man, the torches are unlit. These are not smart villagers.\nSome familiar Universal horror names are here, too. Lionel Atwill plays the mayor; Dwight Frye is one of the villagers. Martha Vickers, who was in the Bogie classic The Big Sleep a few years later, has an uncredited role, as does Jeff Corey.\nI saw this movie as part of an interactive event at the AFI Silver Theater in Silver Spring, Maryland, hosted by Count Gore de Vol. For these showings, the Count stops the movies a couple of times in order to play some trivia or other games, with fabulous prizes. The Count is always good for a hammy, light-hearted performance. Always a treat.\nThe film itself isn't anything to write home about, unless you're really into the continuity thing. The timelines of the Wolf Man and Frankenstein movies don't neatly dovetail, but close enough for government work, as they say. Still a cool movie, made all the better by Count Gore de Vol."}

Countless versions of Buried Alive or The Masque of the Red Death, with some Pit and the Pendulum thrown in for good measure. 1962's Tales of Terror is another entry in the subgenre, only there are three stories, and one combines aspects of two Poe stories.\nThe first one, Morella, is about an aged widower (Vincent Price, who appears in all three stories) who lives alone in an isolated family castle, grieving over his dead wife and blaming the daughter who killed her during childbirth. The now grown child Lenora (Maggie Pierce) shows up to visit her long-estranged dad. Unresolved death! But the deceased Morella has plans for her living husband and daughter.\nNext up is The Black Cat, which also includes elements from The Cask of Amontillado. Peter Lorre plays a loutish drunk named Montresor, married to the lovely and buxom Annabel (Joyce Jameson). Montresor wanders into a meeting of expert wine tasters, led by the gregarious Fortunato Luchresi (Price). Despite Montresor's slovenly, uncultured appearance, he's able to match Luchresi's knowledge of and capacity for wine, and the two become friends. Until Montresor discovers his new friend has been having an affair with Annabel, thus leading to our connection with The Cask of Amontillado. This segment is often pretty funny, particularly when Montresor hallucinates that his head has been lopped off and is being tossed around like a toy. Lorre was reportedly so scared of the head prop that he refused to even touch it.\nFinally, it's The Curious Case of M. Valdemar, in which Price plays a dying man who's beholden to an evil hypnotist played by Basil Rathbone. Rathbone's Carmichael is able to alleviate the constant pain endured by Price's Valdemar, but at a price - as Valdemar passes on, Carmichael will hypnotize him, the better to gain understanding as to what happens in the afterlife. Naturally, he uses this opportunity to take over Valdemar's body, marry his wife, and assume his fortune.

A Most Violent Year is a strong, character-driven drama that's lifted infinitely by terrific lead performances by Oscar Isaacs and Jessica Chastain, inflating what could have been a tiresome, trite look at one man versus the world in an unkind city.\nAbel Morales (Isaac) runs Standard Oil, and he has his eyes on some prime waterfront real estate. With this land, he'll be able to fill his trucks from directly from the oil barges on the river, rather than have the oil transported from boat to someone else's trucks and then to his warehouses. And by saving money there, he'll be able to buy a little more oil than he normally would, keep it on the premises, and then sell it to customers or competitors when demand rises. He makes a deal for the land with a sizable down payment and the stipulation that the balance be tendered within 30 days - no extensions allowed. This, of course, is before Abel's company comes under investigation by an intrepid detective (David Oyelowo), his trucks get highjacked and the oil stolen, and his backers start to, well, back away.\nBut Abel is no wilting flower, whether he's dealing with the fuzz or the other oilmen in the city. He has his convictions, and damned if he's going to give them up to appease anyone. Which, as you might suspect, makes things a little more difficult. His wife Anna (Chastain), who can match Abel in sheer willpower, is also fiercely protective of her husband, her business (she's the bookkeeper), and her family. Sort of a two-pronged attack. Abel's charm and style nets him both friends and enemies, but this isn't yet another mobster movie by any means. In fact, the only direct evidence of organized crime in the movie centers around Abel's competition - men who would do anything to maintain and/or increase their share of the lucrative oil business in the city.\nBoth Isaacs (Inside Llewyn Davis) and Chastain (Interstellar) deliver powerful performances that manage to be both relatable and fascinating. Theirs is not a one-sided relationship. Abel is not some power-mad, bombastic husband who treats the wife and kids as either baggage or items to be used for fun and profit. Anna is not some melodramatic, over-spirited harpy who resents her husband's work obsession. They work together even when they disagree. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention an almost unrecognizable Albert Brooks, the company's astute and slightly amoral lawyer. Brooks, in what appears to be a Karl Malden wig, is a real treat.\nA Most Violent Year carries a strong message, and that message is this: don't count the little guy out, particularly when he (and his spouse) is whip-smart, unafraid to take chances, and endlessly resourceful. High praise indeed for director J.C. Chandor (All Is Lost) and his talented cast."}

This Last Lonely Place is never quite as gritty and unrelenting as its aged predecessors, but it's a fine film in its own right, on its own terms.\nSam Taylor (Rhys Coiro) plans to fly to Hawaii in the morning to connect with his ex wife and their two young daughters. He accepts a call from dispatch to pick up a guy at LAX, an investment banker named Frank Devore (Xander Berkeley). Devore has no destination in mind; he just wants to drive around for a bit, and he pays Sam handsomely. The two men sort of bond, with Devore eventually spilling the beans about what has him in such a tizzy - he's worth hundreds of millions and has a princely part of his wealth right there with him. He's just waiting for a call to come through, and when it finally does, we meet the final cog in our (mostly) three-person wheel: Faye Gardner (Carly Pope).\nFaye and Frank are clearly up to something, and the initial plan of having Sam drive them to the Van Nuys airport is put on hold. As Sam slips deeper and deeper into their plot, he realizes he's being used a pawn - but by whom? That there are double crosses in a movie like this should come as no surprise to anyone. The story plods along for the first twenty minutes or so, and then it really kicks into high gear - particularly when Faye shows up. Her arrival brings with it a much-needed tankful of adrenaline. Up until then, it's just all about Frank crying into his whiskey about how bad things are.\nAt any rate, there are a few twists that, given the number of characters, one could foresee - but that's not to say they're implausible or otherwise anticlimactic. There are some possible lapses in logic, though. At one point, two people each have a gun, and the plot demands that one of those people have both guns. Not just the plot, but the plan. But the gun switches hands only thanks to something that could not have been foreseen by the, uh, plan maker. So how was that person planning to get the gun from the other person? You see how I did that without spoiling things? For a neo-noir movie, This Last Lonely Place seems absent of some of the cinematic touches - hard angles and stark photography. If I had to compare the movie's look with anything, it would be a late-night Cinemax quickie. Not a deal breaker, because the acting is certainly solid, particularly from Pope.\nThis Last Lonely Place's noir bona fides are evident, considering the theme of betrayal and the fact that it was produced by The Bogart Foundation - yes, Humphrey's estate. Kind of lends some panache and verisimilitude to the action."}

While this is no comedy masterpiece, it's enjoyable, likable, and funny. The film is happily not overplotted, and the characters are given just the right amount of depth. This is a simple film that never takes itself seriously, despite the subject matter (the assassination of a world leader).\nDave Skylark (James Franco) is a glitzy, airhead of a celebrity interviewer. He's just completed his 1,000th show, all with his trusty producer Aaron Raporort (Seth Rogen) at the helm. But poor Aaron wants to get away from tabloid TV and do some real news for a change. Turns out that North Korean dictator/snazzy dresser Kim Jong-un (Randall Park) is a huge fan of Skylark Tonight, and soon arrangements are made for the duo to travel to Pyongyang for some face-to-face time with the Supreme Leader.\nThe CIA, realizing an awesome opportunity, visits Skylark and Rapoport. Agent Lacey (Lizzy Caplan) quickly trains the boys on how best to kill lil' Kim: with a poisonous ricin strip whose effects aren't felt for 12 hours. It does seem simple - just get Kim to shake Skylark's hand - but it's just not to be. In Pyongyang, Dave and Aaron are met by Sook (Diana Bang), Kim's spokesperson and inner-circle confidant. She assures the boys that the rumors spread about Supreme Leader aren't true at all, that the citizens have plenty to eat, that Kim is a god who never needs to use the bathroom. Seems legit. They are assigned rooms at the swanky main palace, complete with suspicious guards and tigers roaming the grounds.\nDave's visited by Kim (yes, \"Kim,\" and not \"Jong-un\") and taken for a tour of the place - indoor basketball, operational tank, billiards, and a half-dozen scantily clad young ladies, so he become a little more sympathetic toward Kim's situation, which consternates poor Aaron and fouls up the CIA's plans. But there are more surprises in store, and (happily) very little corresponding character growth.\nIt's a enjoyable movie. Bang is appealing, and Rogen is his usual solid (figuratively speaking) self. Franco seems miscast, as his Skylark is almost universally annoying. I don't know if I can pin that all on Franco, but he does have a track record of being a bit of an irritant, so let's say he probably contributed quite a bit to the problem. Matt Damon was among those considered for the role of Dave Skylark, and that may have worked instead (although the comedy may have been too light for Damon's talents). Thankfully, there aren't glaring errors in logic, a sign of tight writing, although some will quibble about what a TV producer actually does (hint: it's not what Aaron does) and about how the North Koreans in the movie often refer to their own country as \"North Korea\" - something that wouldn't really happen in real life, since everyone knows it's the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Remember, the more you see words like \"Democratic\" or \"Republic\" in a nation's name, the less likely it is that the country is either democratic or a republic.\nThe Interview may not have had much of a theatrical run, thanks to threats from North Korea (or purported representatives thereof), but it should do pretty well as a VOD (and later DVD/Blu-ray) release. This isn't a movie you really need to see in a theater, but it should be worth you time on a smaller screen."}

Along the way, reality and his memories clash, blend, and intertwine.\nAt first, Spider (Ralph Fiennes) does not seem to be a prime candidate for release from a mental hospital. He speaks in tremulous mumbles, has a hunched-over limp, and frequently eyes the ground for items of interest. He takes up residence in a dilapidated group home run by the tyrannical Mrs. Wilkinson (Lynn Redgrave) and makes tentative friends with some of the residents, notably Terrence (John Neville).\nSpider has a small suitcase containing memories from his childhood and a journal in which he records his investigations into his past - in the sort of indecipherable scribble that even ancient Babylonians would consider illegible. Or maybe it was shorthand. Either way, Joe Viewer won't be able to read it.\nHe flashes back to his days living with his doting mother (Miranda Richardson) and loutish father (Gabriel Byrne). Little Spider, who seems different somehow, looks to be more of an obstacle to his father, who frequently needs \"rescuing\" from the local pub around dinner time. His father's lifestyle and mother's lack of empowerment lead to a short sequence of events that ends in tragedy, something the viewer only learns late in the film.\nBut the mystery of Spider's past is only part of the story. Cronenberg deftly moves between the past and present; in many scenes, grown-up Spider watches events involving his younger self, at least the way he remembered it. The temporal fugue allows Spider a new perspective on his past and fills in gaps in his memories. But it's really a test of his own mental faculties: after facing up to what happened all of those years ago, is he truly ready for society? Why is he in a halfway house? Why this one in particular? Fiennes is aces, as is Richardson in a dual role. I loved seeing John Neville, if only in a few scenes, and even Gabriel Byrne does an okay job. That's not easy for Gabriel Byrne."}

There's an island, people in a small group get knocked off one by one, fingers are pointed, and then there's a twist. 80 minutes of fun, fun, fun has just been summed up for you! A businessman named Stark (Teodor Corra) has invited a few friends (and their wives) to his remote island to relax for a weekend. Stark's so rich he has a yacht at his beck and call, so naturally shortly after the festivities begin he sends away the yacht, the better to talk business without running the risk of people actually leaving.\nStark, along with business partners Nick (Maurice Poli) and Jack (Renato Rossini), has an ulterior motive - to convince inventive Professor Gerry Farrell (William Berger) to sell his secret formula for an industrial resin. By any means necessary, perhaps? And then people start popping up all dead - stabbed, shot, asphyxiated, you name it. Has to be someone on the island, right? Maybe one of the survivors? Just maybe? Oh, and did I mention there's also a teenage girl wandering around, supposedly staying with Stark while her parents are away - but for some reason every character forgets about her about ten minutes into the movie.\nSomewhat surprisingly, this is a Mario Bava movie, coming near the end of the horror auteur's long career. There's hardly any blood, not to mention scares or suspense. The only thing this movie really has going for it is its attractive cast.

He managed to have a pretty fair career despite the typecasting. Here, his nascent bad-boy personality and charm kick the movie up a notch or two, making a household name for himself in the process.\nNew Grenada is a fictional town in the middle of the desert, a planned community. There's nothing for kids to do, save for hanging out at the local recreation center - which inconveniently closes at 6 pm. It's only a matter of time before the garden-variety vandalism worsens, and sure enough, when two kids fire a BB gun at a police-officer's car from an overpass, tensions in the town become proportionally thicker.\nAt the center of the movie is young Carl (Michael Eric Kramer), son of the homeowners' association president, who's trying to get Texas millionaires to buy some prime real estate in town (rather than build a bowling alley). Carl is described as a nice, smart kid who happens to run with a rebellious crowd, particularly the perpetually on-probation Richie (Dillon), who wears his damn-the-man attitude like a pair of tighty whities.\nThe scourge of the kids' existence is authority in the name of one Officer Doberman (Harry Northup), who is not above harassing the kids any chance he gets. And, for much of the movie, he gets plenty of chances. And when the rec center is inevitably shut down (the better to prevent the rich investors from noticing the Kid Problem), all hell really breaks loose in a realistic, tragic denouement.\nThe script (by Charles Haas and Tim Hunter) effectively illustrates the angst of late-seventies teens desperate to do something, anything, to entertain themselves, something that'll gain themselves notice if not notoriety. The movie is loosely based on an incident that occurred in a real-life planned community in California in the early 1970s and certainly still rings true today."}

It's certainly a different kind of movie, if only because Frank wears an oversized paper-mache costume head - at all times - but the strong cast propels what might have been an indifferent, familiar storyline.\nJon (Gleeson) has an office job by day and attempts to write songs for his keyboard at night. When he witnesses a band's keyboard player attempting to drown himself in the ocean, Jon is, uh, Jonny on the spot - hired immediately as an emergency replacement by the band's manager, Don (Scoot McNairy) for a gig that night. Bear in mind that poor Jon hasn't heard one note of the band's tunes but being able to play the keys using three chords is all he needs to do, and he acquits himself well. But it ain't over, is it? Don later calls Jon up and asks him if he wants to do it again, he agrees - only to discover that the band, instead of gigging, plans to hole up in a cabin in the woods and record an album.\nIn addition to the puzzling Frank, there's Nana (Carla Azar) on drums and Baraque (Francois Civil) on guitar. Neither seems to like Jon very much, for unknown reasons. But dwarfing them both in that arena is Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who plays synthesizer (including a theremin) and is mercurial and openly antagonistic toward Jon. Perhaps because she views him as attempting to drive a wedge between her and Frank. Perhaps because she is opposed to Frank's notion of making music people will like (and pay for) and intuits that Jon will side with Frank.\nNo one really seems to know what makes Frank tick. He never takes the mask off. No one in the band has ever seen him without it. He takes his meals by way of a straw (seriously), and speakers and earpieces are built into the sides of his mask/head. He sleeps and showers with the thing on. Yes, it's strange, but no one aside from Jon seems to mind. That's because Frank appears to be a musical genius with a terrific voice and a penchant for writing soulful, evocative music.\nGyllenhaal in particular is really excellent as the nasty, spiteful Clara. It's surely not easy to make such a despicable character work, but Gyllenhaal is more than up to the task. And her chemistry with Gleeson and, to a lesser extent, Fassbender, is laser focused. Performances like this remind you just how exceptional an actress Gyllenhaal is. Maybe someday she'll get some true recognition.\nFrank isn't your typical musical biopic, real or fictional, and that's one of its best assets. Given the low box office returns ($644,000 in the U.S.), I'd have to consider this one of the more under-appreciated films of 2014. It's funny, honest, and offbeat."}

Events in the story don't run just parallel to those in the other films, they intersect with them and thus have some sort of impact on the plot of future PA films. That said, The Marked Ones is a pretty good standalone thriller, even if it does use many of the tried-and-true plot devices from the rest of the series.\nThe plot centers around a Latino family in California. Recent high-school graduate Jesse, with a camcorder and a GoPro, films people and things in his apartment complex with the help of his friends Hector and Marisol. An older woman named Ana lives in the apartment directly below Jesse's, and she has a witchly reputation. And then she turns up dead, with Oscar, a former classmate of Jesse, fleeing the scene. Curious, Jesse and Hector investigate Ana's apartment and discover the requisite black magic items and other paraphernalia. And then things get weird.\nDemonic possession is venerated theme, but again writer/director Christopher Landon, who wrote the second, third, and fourth entries in the series, does a fine job of moving the story along without leaving the viewer in too much confusion. True, the first ten minutes or so could have been sped up a bit, but overall this is a quick-paced film. Of course, note that because this is a found-footage film, everything the viewer sees is through the eyes of whoever is holding the camera(s).\nFor much of the movie, one may think that there's little or no connection to the other Paranormal Activity movies, but the final half-hour or so dispels that notion. Experienced fans will recognize some settings and some characters.\nThe Marked Ones is no great shakes, but if you're a fan of the series you should find it satisfactory.

As the end of a trilogy, The Battle of the Five Armies doesn't have the emotional impact that The Return of the King, but it's still fine movie-making. The titular battle is a sweeping epic worthy of turned-up speakers and rattling high definition. It's an entertaining film; it just doesn't carry with it that sheen of instant classic, as its predecessors did.\nThe movie picks up where the previous installment, The Desolation of Smaug, left off. Right away, we're helicoptered into dazzling action, as Smaug is attacking the floating village of Lake-town, burning homes and people alike with only revenge upon his intelligent but lizard-like brain. But it's when the monster is slain - not a giveaway, as it occurs so early in the movie - that things really get going. That's because although the Dwarfs, led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) lay claim to the vast treasure, previously guarded by Smaug, beneath the Erebor, the Lonely Mountain, others want to get their beaks wet as well.\nThe refugees of Lake-Town, led by Bard (Luke Evans), had been promised some of the treasure in exchange for harboring the Dwarfs - and now they need it, what with no homes and few possessions and all. Meanwhile, the Elves, led by Thranduil (Lee Pace) wish to reclaim a particular artifact for themselves, as it was reportedly stolen by Dwarfs eons ago in a different battle. Oh, but that's not all. It seems that a new race of Orcs, led by Azog the Defiler, is intent on taking the mountain as a strategic stronghold. And these are no ordinary, mindless Orcs, either. These guys have skills, more than just brute force.\nThorin and his crew are in the mountain, looking for the Arkstone (a stone meant for the Dwarven King that makes him even more powerful), when Lake-Town falls. But there be madness in the mountain, madness that everyone in the party can feel is seeping into the skull of Thorin himself. As you might imagine, this makes our hero Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) a little uneasy.\nAnd what to make of these new Orcs? It's a situation that both puzzles and worries Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen), Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), Elrond (Hugo Weaving), and Saruman (Christopher Lee) - yep, all four appear in this movie. And, what's more, what they discover has direct ramifications for the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy to follow. Another connected subplot is the burgeoning romance between Dwarf Kili (Aidan Turner) and Elf Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly), with protective Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom) looking on concernedly, although it was not part of Tolkien's original work.\nSo why isn't this a stunning spectacle on par of the LOTR movies? Because of a lack of emotional punch. The Lord of the Rings books were long and detailed, and director Peter Jackson slipped as much detail into the movies as possible. Much of the journey that the Fellowship undertook was seen on screen, allowing the viewer to get to know the characters and really empathize with them. There were also dynamics within the group (Gimli/Legolas, Frodo/Sam, Boromir/Aragorn) that are missing here. Really, many of the Dwarfs are interchangeable - as their similar-sounding names indicate - and the only real dynamics are between Thorin and Bilbo and between Thorin and Everyone Else. A lack of empathy for the Dwarfs' plight makes them less protagonists and more just regular participants in the sweeping plot.\nTo be sure, the battle is a terrific scene. Dwarfs, Elves, Men, Orcs, perhaps something else that may not have been in the original book - they all come together in close hand-to-hand combat. For some, it's a fight to reclaim treasure; for others, it's a fight to gain the upper hand in a larger, upcoming war. And for still others, the fate of the whole of Middle-earth rests in who takes the mountain. Knowing the ultimate resolution to the battle doesn't diminish one's appreciation of it, either.\nAnd when the movie does end, the final scene is a fitting coda. It doesn't pack the punch of the end of Return of the King, and couldn't - because readers know already of the events following The Hobbit and leading up to The Fellowship of the Ring. Jackson does a fine job with the tale, even if The Hobbit was just one short book and even if he had to invent characters (Tauriel). He did the best with what he had, and he was the right choice to direct the trilogy all along. Even his doppleganger, Guillermo del Toro, wouldn't have given us as much of a thrill ride."}

The same is true today, except for the snakes part. Medusa is the best known of the Gorgons, but in 1964's Hammer Films classic The Gorgon, Megaera is the titular fiend \u2013 even though there was a Fury, and not Gorgon, by that name in mythology.\nThe film takes place at the turn of the 20th century in small town in an unnamed European country. A young man has been found hanged, his pregnant lover turned to stone. The coroner declares the young man to be the murderer of the woman. The man's father investigates and stumbles across Megaera in an abandoned castle during a full moon. He, too, is turned to stone and perishes, but not before leaving a note for his other son, who investigates even further.\nThe great Peter Cushing plays the coroner, Dr. Namaroff (backward it reads F for a man \u2013 how's that for trivia?). Namaroff insists there's no Gorgon, that everyone's death is quite explainable, and so on. He has a lovely assistant, as was the style back in the day, Carla Hoffman (Barbara Shelley), who's sympathetic toward son #2, Paul (Richard Pasco). It seems that everyone in the village knows of the legend of Megaera, and Paul ascertains that she's seen only during a full moon.\nAfter a couple of encounters with Megaera, Paul finds assistance from his own supervisor, a Prof. Karl Meister (Christopher Lee). As you might expect, Lee commands the screen and gives the movie a huge jolt of adrenaline when he finally shows up. Lee and Cushing appeared in many, many horror movies together, but they don't appear in the same scene face to face until the movie's about 80% over. Still, this would have been real junk had they not lent their talents.\nThe big quibble is with the Gorgon herself. Heavy makeup was applied to the actress, and the first several times we see the Gorgon, she does look mighty scary (often in shadows), but when the denouement arrives, her Gorgon head looks terrible, like a dummy made out of plexiglass and bitterness. The Gorgon has everything except a Gorgon, really."}

You know, for kicks. Last night, I was oh-so-honored to watch the 1951 classic Bride of the Gorilla. Not classic enough to be Bride of Frankenstein or Bride of Dracula, and not junky enough to be Bride of the Monster. Oh, and there's no gorilla.\nThe DVD was part of a set, each movie appearing on an episode of Count Gore de Vol's Creature Feature. The good Count introduces the movie, along with some awesomely lowbrow yuks, and then makes a return appearance about halfway through. The jokes are corny, but the delivery is terrific and engaging. Love the Count.\nOkay. Bride of the Gorilla. It seems plantation worker Barney Chavez (Raymond Burr) has the hots for the wife (Barbara Payton) of the company's owner, Van Gelder (Paul Cavanagh). The two don't see eye to eye, of course, and somehow Chavez gets himself fired. This leads to a confrontation in a moonlit garden right outside the jungle, and Van Gelder is killed. But, unbeknownst to Chavez, the act has been witnessed by a witch/gypsy/stereotypical old lady who knows the dark arts, Al-Long (Gisele Werbisek), who puts a curse on Chavez \u2013 that he will see himself as a beast of the jungle and act the part, even though no one else will see any difference.\nWhat this means is that Chavez, although married to the luscious Payton, goes running off into the jungle every night, ears tuned to the various animal noises. And that leads to goats being found slaughtered and the locals being panicked. If this sounds a little like The Wolf Man, that's because it's sort of the same thing \u2013 except here we don't get to see much of Chavez's transformation at all. In fact, he's a gorilla only in the title. In the movie, he's referred to as a mythical beast that walks on its hind legs. You'll find that it doesn't matter and that you don't care.\nLon Chaney Jr., who played The Wolf Man himself a decade earlier, is the (strangely competent) inspector here, and Tom Conway as the kindly local doctor who also has a crush on the new widow. Both, along with Burr and Payton, acquit themselves here. It's not their fault the movie has no production values and almost no script.\nWhile looking up this movie on IMDb, I found out a lot about Barbara Payton, whom I'd never heard of before. Payton was quite the bed hopper in her day, but she was apparently more than just some naive farm girl \u2013 she had a mean streak, too. At one point she was engaged to Franchot Tone but still proposed to Tom Neal, and that led to a huge brawl between the two actors that landed them both in the hospital. Tone wound up in a coma! She bounced back and forth between Tone and Neal. She had an affair with Bob Hope, of all people, that was broken off only when she demanded more money. She had an affair with Woody Strode during the filming of Bride of the Gorilla, and this affair essentially killed her career, as interracial romance was still quite taboo in the early 1950s. Payton lived a short, unhappy career, dying of organ failure before her 40th birthday. Yeesh.\nIs Bride of the Gorilla worth your time? Nah, not especially. It's short, though, so not too much time would be wasted. It's still better than Ed Wood's Bride of the Monster, though."}

Unfortunately, it's a failing society, and it's only a matter of time before the planet is uninhabitable by mankind.\nEnter ex-scientist/pilot Coop (Matthew McConaughey) who's now a single dad raising two precocious kids along with his father in law. Through a series of plausible coincidences, Coop and his daughter Murphy stumble upon plans to send a manned mission to another galaxy by use of a wormhole - and those in charge want Coop to be the pilot. The idea is that the spacecraft Endurance, piloted by Coop, will fly through the wormhole and land on one or more of three potentially life-sustaining (according to data sent back by probes) planets. Once a suitable planet has been located, citizens of Earth will be transported via space stations - assuming NASA scientist Dr. Brand (Michael Caine) can solve the gravity-is-a-harsh-mistress problem.\nAboard the Endurance with Coop are scientists Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway), Romily, and Doyle, along with robots TARS and CASE. That they do enter the wormhole and come out in a wholly different galaxy (the movie should have been called Intergalactic, right?) is not a spoiler. The trouble is that at least one of the three planet candidates is very close to a large black hole, ominously named Gargantua. What if this planet is the best alternative to Earth? Can't be safe to be so close to a black hole; luckily, the planet's mass is large enough to keep it from passing Gargantua's event horizon, so all is good. Well, good as I can make it without explaining what troubles Coop and crew run into, and that could ruin things for you, dear viewer.\nIt's possible some will find this movie to be a little overplotted (yet too vague), with a surfeit of exposition to help things along. This is necessary in part, though, because of two different timelines - that of Coop in the far-off galaxy and that of Murph back on Earth itself. And this is because of a time slip that Coop encounters that slows time for him relative to Earth time, to the tune of one outer-space minute equaling several years on Earth.\nAdmittedly, there were moments when I felt like I'd missed something - that's attributable to how quickly Nolan propels the plot and to how damnably loud the soundtrack is at times. Hans Zimmer's score is excellent, but clearly someone figured that turning it up to 11 was the way to go. I mean, why allow an intricate plot get in the way of booming, sweeping sounds? Also, like Kubrick's 2001, the final twenty minutes can be puzzling. There's not much more that can be said about this that won't reveal something important. I found it fascinating and satisfying and in keeping with the rest of the movie. Perhaps not all loose ends are tied up at the end, but I'm one of those who feels that's a good thing.\nNolan's Interstellar is spectacle supported by solid science and a fertile imagination. If the Academy Awards included only five nominees for Best Picture, this film probably wouldn't make the cut - but it should be among the top ten for the year and thus earn such a nomination, along with some for sound and effects."}

I'm doing this for you. Well, you and me. Okay, me. Mostly me.\nBut last night I caught a movie I gotta tell you all about. It's called Frogs (1972), and it stars Ray Milland, Sam Elliott, and Joan Van Ark. Kind of an eclectic cast right there. And, as you may have surmised, it's about frogs. And a whole bunch of other critters, too.\nSee, there's this remote island in the middle of a big lake. Jason Crockett is a mean, miserable, wheelchair-bound coot who rules his plantation-style home with an iron fist. He's surrounded by family and servants and all this dadblasted nature all over the place, with no other humans on the island. A freelance photographer named Pickett Smith, taking pictures in a canoe in the lake, finds himself capsized when a speedboat driven by Crockett's son Clint bum rushes him in the water. The soggy lensman is brought to the stately manor to dry, and Old Man Crockett takes a liking to him, somewhat begrudgingly.\nIn a plot that has a passing resemblance to Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None (and countless other movies, come to think of it), people start dying in rather gruesome ways - strangulation by snake, spider bite, poisoning - and we're led to believe that it's the frogs, the ribbeting frogs, who are behind this nefarious plot. Mother Nature's fighting back, says Smith. And how! Milland, who was in such classics as Dial M for Murder, Lost Weekend, and The Uninvited, appears to have fallen on hard times - although he wouldn't be the only one. The early 1970s were a time when former stars resorted to low budget horror movies, like Joan Crawford in Trog or Veronica Lake in Flesh Feast. Milland is basically a Lionel Barrymore clone here. Smith is played by Sam Elliott in his starring debut (he'd appeared in a quick scene in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid), and he's a lot like the Sam Elliott we all know and love - the quiet, soft-spoken type. This is Young Sam Elliott, so he's shirtless there and again. Clint, the bully-like son, is played by Adam Roarke, who so often turned up in biker movies of the late 1960s and early 1970s, often to tangle with Jack Nicholson in loud pants. He's wisely drunk most of this movie. Playing Clint's kindly and lascivious sister Karen is Joan Van Ark in her film debut. Van Ark and Elliott make a nice couple, too.\nThe acting isn't terribly good, but neither is the story. Sentient frogs? Okay. What about sentient lizards who know to knock over large beakers helpfully labeled \"poison\" so that someone trapped inside with no ventilation will die? Or - and I swear I am not making this up - windy, willowy branches of one of those large swamp trees found in the Louisiana bayous that intentionally wrap themselves around an unsuspecting biped? Why, it won't matter if you have a boat, either - because iguanas will chew right through your tow line just to mess you up. They do not mess around, these fellas.\nThere's even a scene of birds attacking, an homage to or ripoff of The Birds. But the film was so low budget that the birds were actually stock footage superimposed on the rest of the film. Looks so realistic.\nSo, okay. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, this isn't. A waste of a decent cast, this is. This is one campy movie that probably needed more camp to make it worth your while. At least they tried to make the frogs look sinister."}

There are no Games, for one thing. For another, there's nowhere near the amount of action, as the tale focuses much more on the political machinations between the Capitol and the fabled District 13. And yet director Francis Lawrence does a fine job of presenting a gripping story that, like its predecessors, brings the heart-wrenching pain dappled with grand fire and brimstone. It's a rare 'tweener movie that can stand on its own, too.\nKatniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), you've just blown a hole through the Hunger Games. Whaddya gonna do now? Hop on over to District 13, apparently, which is the home of those who are darn well fed up with the crazy shenanigans of President Snow (Donald Sutherland) in the Capitol. Katniss quickly learns that her fellow Games winner, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) is alive and well, sort of, doing propaganda interviews with Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) in an attempt to get the rebel scum to lay down their weapons. Katniss, appalled at Snow's use of Peeta and at the destruction that the Capitol's military military has wrought, decides to become the Mockingjay, a true symbol around which the downtrodden, beaten-down residents of the not-well-off districts can rally.\nDistrict 13 is run by President Coin (Julianne Moore), who's every bit as intelligent, strong, creative, and resourceful as you'd suspect Julianne Moore to be in real life. She's convinced by former gamesmaster Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) that Katniss should be welcomed into the district and become the new face of the rebellion. This, naturally, leads to Snow's use of Peeta as more of a personal propaganda weapon aimed at Katniss herself. But who's zoomin' whom? Peeta seems awfully convincing when he tells everyone to lay down their weapons and surrender. It's no wonder that the rebels see him as a tool of The Man and are out for his blood, right? With no games to carry the bulk of the movie, the run time is a little shorter (by about 20 minutes), but that doesn't mean there's no fighting going on. Katniss and her former boyfriend \u2013 or is it also future? \u2013 Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth) are armed with a bow and a Big Gun, respectively, in defense of District 13. We may not get to see hand-to-hand combat, but at least we're not seeing children kill each other. In fact, this entry in the series features far fewer on-screen deaths. But rest easy, there are plenty of harrowing moments, because when one side has a metric ton of big weapons and you do not, you're likely to get stomped on a little bit.\nThe decrease in violence allows the viewer an even better look at some truly terrific acting. The performances by Lawrence, Hoffman, Moore are all award caliber, and I don't mean \"for an action movie based on a young-adult movie,\" either. They're really great, which isn't a big surprise considering the pedigree each possesses. Still, it's nice to see layered character development in a blockbuster, and if this were a more-typical drama, even more praise would be justly heaped upon the cast.\nAlso along for the ride are Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) as the scraggly former Victor with more sense than he lets on; Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) as Katniss' fashion consultant, even in hiding; and Beetee (Jeffrey Wright), the former Tribute who's the tech wizard for District 13. They all have jobs to do in this new world order, and each job centers around making Katniss not into just a one-dimensional heroine for the world but to bring that heroine out of Katniss. You know, organically.\nI'll admit that the first twenty minutes or so felt a little slow. Not forced, just a stark contrast to the pulse-pounding action of the earlier movies. But then things kick into a whole 'nother gear once Katniss see what's become of her beloved District 12, reduced to rubble in the aftermath of the last Hunger Games. It's compelling, wrenching stuff, particularly when you realize that's not just rubble laying before Katniss.\nIn all, I think Lawrence and company did an exemplary job. You know, it doesn't seem terribly difficult to stage manage action scenes \u2013 you let the tech guys do their thing and listen to your DP. But when you have to get your audience to identify with characters and relate to their plight, that takes a softer touch. And it's all well and good to just let Hoffman and Moore and Lawrence do their thing, but Lawrence also elicits fine, underplayed performances from Hutcherson, Hemsworth, Harrelson, and even Sutherland."}

The title is not a metaphor. It seems that a crusty old doctor, despondent that his daughter's face is, well, no longer present owing to a terrible car accident, has resorted to kidnapping young women, removing their faces, and grafting the faces onto his daughter. The results are not always optimal.\nDoctor Genessier (Pierre Brasseur) has already successfully grafted skin onto the face of his elder daughter, Louise (Alida Valli), with only a minor scar as evidence. But younger daughter Christiane (Edith Scob) has proved to be a more difficult subject, er, patient. Even when the doctor appears to be successful, Christiane's face begins to deteriorate, to the point where she is relegated to wearing a sculpted mask that completely obscures her marred features. Christiane is both ashamed of her condition and increasingly distressed at the lengths to which her father will go to restore his daughter's beauty.\nGiven the French names of the characters, it's no surprise that this movie is actually in French (with English subtitles). But, as is often the case with well-done cinema, these subtitles do nothing to distract from the drama and horror on screen. And this isn't some cheap melodrama, either - it's a horror treat. Director Georges Franju never truly reveals Christiane's non-face face; she's either wearing her mask or is shown in very, very soft focus. This gets the imagination percolating - just how terrible does she look? We do get a sense of the extent of her injuries when we see Genessier operating on one of his victims, carefully slicing the skin off her face (with holes cut out for the eyes, nose, and mouth).\nIn this day and age (more than 50 years after the film was released), it's not hard to imagine a serial killer or similar psychopath performing the same surgeries. We've had bad guys skin their victims and make clothes out of them. We've had cannibals with willing victims. Our imaginations are no match for real life. The barbarism of Eyes without a Face is such that the unscheduled operations do not always result in a sedated slip into the next world but rather a life viewed through scarred, trembling, naked eyes."}

Then Leda (Kaaren Verne), a mysterious woman, shows up looking for Joe. Gloves, at the behest of his well-meaning Ma (Jane Darwell), looks into the matter, but soon he's suspect number one himself. What will happen when Gloves finds out who's behind Joe's murder? Who is this dizzy dame with the cool accent? And when will Gloves figure out that Nazis are involved? The answers may not surprise you.\nSurrounding Gloves are characters straight out of Damon Runyon or Chester Gould's Dick Tracy. His right-hand man is named Sunshine (William Demarest, not known for his sunny attitude). His gofer and second top accomplice is Barney (Frank McHugh), who throughout the film begs Gloves to give him a few minutes' leave to be with his girl - whom he marries during the movie and who's on screen for maybe five minutes. That's the life of a wiseguy. Also among Gloves' crew are a waiter (Phil Silvers) and Starchy, played by the one and only Jackie Gleason, billed with a middle initial of C. for this early role.\nOn the bad-guy side of the ledger is ringleader Franz Ebbing (Conrad Veidt), his top man Pepi (Peter Lorre), and maybe Leda. Others, too, but they're not consequential. The ring operates out of a high-class auction house, where Sunshine and Gloves are just a tad out of place. But the dialog! Just check out some of the zingers. When Gloves spots a portrait of Hitler on the wall at the gang's headquarters - and this is before Pearl Harbor - he exclaims, \"I recognize the face but I don't know where to put it. Hey, there's more here than meets the FBI!\" When Barney is rebuffed again about trying to see his girl/wife, he laments having to spend his honeymoon with Sunshine, who deadpans, \"Well, I can cook.\" It's a treat to see such tough, hardened baddies whip out such jumping lines.\nEssentially, this is a propaganda film made to convince America to join in the fun that would later be called World War II, but it's never over the top. It dabbles in patriotism and focuses its energy on the thrill of the spy chase and the juice of busting up terrorists. And terrorists these are, even in the modern sense, as a suicide bombing comes into play near the end.\nIt's not one of Bogie's better-known films, but All through the Night is absolutely terrific. You tend to forget how gifted the man was at comedy (see his later We're No Angels, for example). He's got the moves, he's got the patter, he's got the girl, and he's got the moxie. Great job all around."}

The result is a movie that's about 30 minutes longer than its English-language counterpart, with more-nuanced characterizations and some additional plot threads from the story.\nCount Dracula (Carlos Villarias) receives his solicitor Renfield (Pablo Alvarez Rubio) in his dark, crumbling, in-need-of-a-maid castle. Renfield carries with him papers that grant Dracula possession of Carfax Abbey in London. After signing the papers, the Count bids his guest good night. Next thing Renfield knows, he's in the hold of a ship foundering in a storm on the high seas. Dracula has risen from his coffin and helped himself. In London, Renfield is taken to a sanatorium and placed under the care of a Dr. Seward (Jose Soriano Viosca), who happens to have a lovely daughter named Eva (Lupita Tovar) - known as Mina in Stoker's story. Also on the scene are Eva's boyfriend Juan (Barry Norton) and a visiting scientist named Dr. Van Helsing (Eduardo Arozamena), and the fight is on for Eva's soul and blood.\nThe film was directed by George Melford, who didn't speak a word of Spanish. Even so, he elicited fantastic performances from his cast, notably Rubio, Tovar, and Arozamena. There's more melodrama (pregnant pauses, etc.) than occur in most English-language movies, but the women dress a tiny bit more provocatively, particularly for 1931, so it sort of evens out.\nI had the opportunity to watch this with live musical accompaniment from Gary Lucas, who played with (among others) Captain Beefheart. Lucas came up with his own compositions that properly fit the mood and setting of each scene; the original had nothing in the way of music save for a song played over the opening credits. And there Gary was, right on stage with his bottleneck guitar and other instruments. He's accompanied horror films before - earlier that afternoon he did Carl Theodor Dreyer's Vampyr, to similar great acclaim. It's true that nowadays a movie has far too much music, enough to drown out such quaint subtleties as plot, but the older ones simply couldn't afford to record music, not during the Great Depression. Lucas' work here is admirable and supportive of a classic film."}

Trouble is, they don't know that Marak's just killed his wife, who was about to leave him, and has buried her in a shallow grave. Now he thinks his mysterious caller knows too much - and he's out to find her.\nThis is another post-gimmick horror movie from the legendary William Castle, and like The Night Walker and Strait-Jacket, there are plenty more genuine scares than campy laughs. This is also the kind of movie that couldn't quite be duplicated in this day and age, of course. The girls find their numbers not by just dialing random digits but by picking names out of the phone book. That's because back then, many numbers weren't even used (even though the full number consisted of a two-letter designation for the town/exchange and then five numbers), so Kit and Libby could have tried a score of phone numbers before getting an answer.\nBut the use of the phone book adds to the story in another way. Kit and Libby think Steve's voice sounds darn hunky, so they decide to snag Libby's mom's car and head to good ol' Steve's house. You know, just to see what he looks like. Late at night. They're not even going to get out of the car! They drag along Libby's kid sister Tess, because they're not going to leave her alone in their secluded forest house! They're responsible! There's a side plot. Steve's a little crazed (even before killing his wife, played by Joyce Meadows), but he's almost stable compared with his neighbor Amy, played by the inimitable Joan Crawford. Amy is obsessed with Steve - it's unclear whether they'd been having an affair, but Amy's intentions are transparent - to the point where, once she realizes what Steve's done, she attempts to blackmail him into marrying her and having a whopping fun life together. It's wacked-out Crawford at her late-career best. This was supposed to be a cameo, but she nails the role so perfectly that she gets extra time for bad behavior.\nPrank calls, kids. They were a bad idea in 1965, and they're a really bad idea in 2014, when anyone can either tell who is calling them or call them back with that old standby the *69. You know, for those who don't have call-waiting. So you can't pull this malarkey nowadays - too likely that you get some crazed lunatic with no sense of humor.\nAnother fun Castle thriller with some pretty solid work from even the kid actors (Sara Lane, Andi Garrett, Sharyl Locke). The moody fog surrounding the isolated home also sets the perfect tone for an underrated thriller."}

It's an under-appreciated, almost-forgotten gem that's carried by the charismatic lead characters, played by Ron Leibman (now known as the voice of Ron Cadillac in the FX series Archer) and David Selby.\nLeibman and Selbey play new cops Greenberg and Hantz who quickly tire of traffic duty and begin to solve crimes and bust crooks in their spare time. (No, really.) They accomplish this by thinking outside the rule book, in particular the one with the unwritten rules. They refuse to take bribes or grease palms. They receive assistance from convicted criminals. They stake out drug dealers in a giant cardboard box. All of this earns them some high profile busts and the enmity of pretty much every other cop in their precinct, particularly their new direct supervisor, Lt. O'Shaughnessy (Joseph Sirola).\nI realize this sounds like what's now a typical buddy-cop movie: a pair bucks the system to do what's right. And it sort of is a progenitor to those films. But look here, this story, based on the book by L. H. Whittemore, was a bit more groundbreaking than all of those Lethal Weapon clones we've seen over the past two decades. The cops aren't always good guys? They can make mistakes and have lapses in ethics? No one wants to see Greenburg and Hantz succeed, not nobody, not no how! But they do their best anyway, even if it means no advancement. They'll work in a crappy precinct for a jerky boss, even on desk or traffic duty, and then work cases in their spare time. Their spare time! The other cops try hard to dissuade the dynamic duo \u2013 nicknamed Batman and Robin for their comic-book-like exploits \u2013 from messing around with their traditional system of not caring (particularly after the shift's over). Meanwhile, Greenburg and Hantz just want to clean up one of New York's worst crack-infested areas, The Man be damned. They're crazy like foxes, is what they are. How crazy? They try to take down one baddie while the building they're in is being demolished. Pretty awesome scene.\nThe Super Cops is available on DVD, finally.

He sometimes did genuine thrillers. Take The Night Walker. A woman, kept housebound by her wealthy, elderly, blind husband, suffers from vivid nightmares of a tall, dark stranger who's just out of reach. Her husband records her talking in her sleep and concludes she's having an affair with a younger man. The old man tries to enlist his attorney to find out more but instead dies in an on-site lab fire. Now the woman still has those dreams, but there's a new guest - her dearly departed husband.\nIs Irene Trent (Barbara Stanwyck, in her final film role) cheating on her husband? The audience learns the answer in quick order. But who is this strange man in her dreams? She doesn't recognize him, doesn't know his name. And the dreams feel incredibly real. She's visited, embraced, taken places familiar and yet unknown to her. Her sleep is restless, her psyche unstable.\nIrene turns to attorney Barry Morland (Robert Taylor), and it's clear she has a bit of a thing for him - but he's not the man in the dream, either. What's more, some nights she feels as if she's not in a dream at all but is an active participant in a surreal romance. It gets to the point where poor Irene can't easily tell the difference.\nThere are some Castle trademarks. There's an emphasis on the nature of sleep and consciousness, and to illustrate how mind-warpy that concept is, Castle treats us to spiraling animation and his own actors' melodramatic acting. But this isn't Joan Crawford in Strait-Jacket; Stanwyck is commanding and alluring as the victimized Irene. Also of note is the terrific score, although with no soundtrack listed it's hard to tell where the music comes from. (Vic Mizzy, who composed music for The Addams Family, The Munsters, and Green Acres, was responsible for the tunes here.) There's also a nifty twist at the end that most sharp viewers will catch, but it's still satisfying. Taylor, Lloyd Bochner (as the \"dream\" lover), and Hayden Rorke (as the jealous husband) offer fine support. The film's well shot, making excellent use of low-lit interiors to convey a sense of claustrophobia and general fear. This is quite the unsung Castle classic."}

El Vampiro Negro, an Argintinian film whose title translates as The Black Vampire, is a remake of Fritz Lang's legendary M, starring Peter Lorre as a child killer. But this is no shot-for-shot remake. The acting is astonishing on all fronts, and the plot is tight and fraught with dread. And the look! Although the movie was released in 1953 (and almost never seen in the U.S.A.), a bit past the classic noir era, there's a distinct look of those gritty dramas afoot.\nTeodoro Ulber (Nathan Pinzon), known as The Professor, is on trial for murder as the movie begins. After his attorney asks for confinement to a mental institution and the prosecution asks for the death penalty, a flashback reveals how Ulber made it to this point. Outside a dance hall, a short, portly figure drags the body of a little girl from a worn sack and throws it down a sewage shaft. The next day, a homeless man, deep within the sewer tunnels of the city, comes across the body. He alerts the police, who (of course) toss him in jail as a possible suspect, and the manhunt is on.\nBut Ulber's actions didn't go unseen. Through window in the basement of the dance hall, a young performer named Amalia (Olga Zubarry) spies the wretched little man. But she keeps quiet, at the behest of the club's unscrupulous owner. The owner fears he'd come under too-close scrutiny, and Amalia fears that she'll receive unwanted publicity \u2013 for, although she's a dancer of ill repute (!), she does have a sweet young daughter whom she's been able to send to a private school, at her own great sacrifice.\nWhat's more, one of Amalia's coworkers, Cora (Nelly Panizza) is actually acquaintances with Ulber, who awkwardly pitches woo at Cora. Without realizing that Ulber is indeed the Black Vampire, Cora and Amalia aid in his escape from the police (led by prosecutor Bernar, played by Roberto Escalada), which only opens up the possibility of more children being murdered.\nThis is by no means a gory film. In fact, there's almost no blood at all (and none anywhere near a child). But the harsh camera of Anibal Gonzalez Paz tells a story all on its own: the desperate vulnerability of Ulber, the jaded countenance of Bernar, the shadowy streets and tunnels and back alleys of the city. Gonzalez Paz artfully direct the viewer's attention not to what is present but to what may be coming just around the bend.\nThe movie premiered in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in October 1953 but didn't make it over to the States until January 2014. 61 years! 61 years before this masterful work by Roman Vinoly Barreto could be seen (with subtitles) over here, and more's the pity. El Vampiro Negro is a tremendous accomplishment that's not to be missed.\nHuge thanks to the Film Noir Foundation and to the AFI Silver Theatre in Silver Spring, Maryland for making this screening possible!"}

Flippen) - make themselves scarce. Keechie doesn't think much of her patient and his lifestyle. And make no mistake, Bowie feels little shame in his role, which has included murder. No bright-eyed neophyte, he. But there's something about Keechie, her deliberate movements, her slinky smile, that really appeals to Bowie, and the two slowly fall for each other.\nThe first shot by Ray (in his directorial debut) is an early helicopter angle, as the bad boys speed down a rural road as they escape from jail. In fact, it's the first helicopter action shot, as previous uses of the vehicle were simply to shoot landscapes to set a scene. In any event, a tire is blown and the gang heads toward a farmhouse, where they meet farmer Mobley (Will Wright) and his daughter Keechie. There's chemistry just dripping between Granger and O'Donnell; both seem more naive than they truly are, and although each pretends to dislike the other, it's not long before them old hormones come a-knocking, although not too much, because this is 1948, after all, and the movie's set some 15 years earlier. On the run they go! Ray's first feature is strikingly shot. Aside from that iconic opening helicopter shot, there's also a great little scene of the gang pulling off a job - from Bowie's perspective as the driver. A bystander tries to engage Bowie in conversation just as T-Dub and Chickamaw run out of the building, earning him a rough shove to the face. That's noir film for you. Watch your face! O'Donnell and Granger work very well together (no surprise, since the latter recommended the former for the role), although I think most of the appeal comes from O'Donnell, who turns in a graceful, passionate, and unique performance as the trusting Keechie. Granger, appearing in only his third film (with Rope on the horizon) was never really that good of an actor, and so many of his lines are delivered in an almost nonchalant monotone that you wonder if some lessons weren't in his immediate future. At least no one can accuse him of hamming it up.\nAnd do you know who produced this masterpiece? None other than the great John Houseman, who most of us remember from his old Smith-Barney commercials but who was also one of Orson Welles' Mercury Theatre performers back in the day. The man knew talent, and he picked Nicholas Ray to direct without input from the studio. It's to Houseman's credit that the movie's as good as it is - which is to say, a true noir classic. There may not be a Bonnie and Clyde ending, but we're not talking about a Disney finale, either. Bonus cameo - the jeweler who sells Bowie a watch is played by none other than Will Lee. Yes, the same Will Lee who would go on to play Mr. Hooper on Sesame Street."}

In the grand tradition of Frankenstein (1931), Bride of Frankenstein (1935), and Son of Frankenstein (1939) comes the fourth in Universal's series. This time around, the crazy doctor of the title is Ludwig (Sir Cedric Hardwicke), the brother of Basil Rathbone's character in Son of and the (other) son of Colin Clive's original Dr. Frankenstein in the original and Bride of movies.\nA generation or so has passed since the villagers last destroyed the Monster in a sulphur pit. But, of course, he's only mostly dead, and his old pal Ygor (Bela Lugosi) holds vigil outside the old Frankenstein castle, hoping the creature will revive himself. At the same time, angry villagers are mobilizing; they decide that there's a Frankenstein curse that's prohibiting their crops from growing and businesses outside of town (named after Frankenstein, for some reason) are refusing to deal with them. The curse must be broken, so off the villagers go to burn down the castle. The explosion indeed wakes up the preserved Monster, and he's reunited with his old pal Ygor.\nThere's another Frankenstein a village or so away, as the crow flies - Ludwig. Ludwig, who runs an insane asylum out of his house, also works for the police; when the Monster is captured and put on trial, the good doctor is called in to deal with the situation. But Ygor, he's a cunning sort, and he persuades Ludwig to get the Monster remanded to Ludwig's own castle so that Dr. Frankenstein can work on giving the Monster a nice, new brain. (There appears to be some brain damage for the big guy; he can't speak, as he could - haltingly - in previous films, and simple logic isn't his forte.) Ygor, he of the broken neck from being ineptly hanged, wants his own brain to be placed in the creature's cranium.\nThe setting is as eerie and stark as in other Universal monster movies. Hidden rooms, long staircases, vaulted ceilings - it's a realtor's dream. Ludwig also has a grown daughter Elsa (Evelyn Ankers, another Universal staple), who's probably named after Elsa Lanchester, who starred in Bride of Frankenstein. Elsa's boyfriend is Erik Ernst (Ralph Bellamy), who's stuck between the mob rule of the town and his fondness of the Frankensteins. Lionel Atwill plays one of Dr. Frankenstein's doctor associates. Lon Chaney, Jr., by the way, grunts his way around a macabre set as the Monster itself.\nFor a movie that's the fourth in a series, Ghost of Frankenstein (so named, perhaps, because the ghost of the original Doctor appears) is competently acted, directed, and shot. No, more than that, it's expertly done. There's some overacting (Ankers), to be sure, but overall it's a very well realized hidden gem among Universal's many horror movies of the early 20th century."}

This just means that this film, like most of von Trier's movies, is an acquired taste. Nothing, it seems, is verboten. It's not really for the faint of heart.\nAn anonymous couple, played by Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg, suffer the loss of their toddler, who's fallen out a window a few stories up. Each grieves in his own manner, with the woman leaning on drugs prescribed by a psychiatrist and the man holding it all in. Finally, they head to a lakeside cabin, just the two of them, in order to best work through their pain. And then things get weird.\nIt's not a standard horror film, despite the remote setting, but it's explicitly violent. von Trier received quite a bit of criticism for his perceived misogyny displayed here, but I've come to believe that the film is more misanthropic than anything else. There's a subplot moving within the story's firmament about women from centuries past who were believed to be actual witches, but the connection to the woman is teased out to us. In the end, that subplot behaves as filler that ambiguously explains the cause of the previous 90 minutes of carnage.\nSome scenes demand close attention. The man's earnest attention to his wife's troubles seem to hide his own panic and terror. He tries valiantly to guide his wife back to sanity, but he's in over his head. There's something about their cabin, too; named Eden, it seems to be both the source of and the answer to all of their problems. Perhaps because something intense happened there the previous summer when the woman visited with the couple's son.\nIt's safe to say that Antichrist is a gruesome mind trip. There's deep symbolism afoot, sometimes with subtlety in the form of woodland creatures and other times a lot more bluntly, as in blunt instrument. A psychological horror film, Antichrist is a fine road-not-taken, sublime horror."}

Yes, no more of waiting for a huge thunderstorm to get enough electricity to jolt a corpse! Just one hypo is all you need.\nThe good doctor is assisted by a former vaudevillian named Don Maxwell (William Woods) who does impressions.

At least I assume they did, given the poor lighting and unintelligible voices.\nInterestingly enough, there's brief nudity.

The scares and jolts seen in its predecessor, The Conjuring, aren't nearly as prevalent this time around, to the point where one begins to relax or even doze off.\nAnnabelle is about the events leading up to the events that lead up to those in The Conjuring. Mia and John Gordon (Annabelle Wallis and Ward Horton) are about to be parents. John is harried by his stressful life as a med student, and to make up for aloof attitude he locates and purchases an old, large doll for his wife, who's been searching for the doll for years. But this fairly tale story is quickly shattered when, in the middle of the night, the Gordons are attacked by a crazed duo who injure the pregnant Mia before themselves dying by bullet or knife. One of the attackers is the estranged daughter of the Gordons' neighbors, the Higgins, who have also been slaughtered. The Gordons move to a new place, as would we all.\nConfined to bed rest for the final month of her pregnancy, Mia experiences some strange happenings. She hears whispers. She sees things. She nearly dies in a kitchen fire. It's the doll, I tell you - it's always something material. How else would a demon house itself while waiting for a soul to take? It's just logic. In any event, John and Mia enlist the help of their local priest, Father Perez (Tony Amendola), who is himself badly injured when he attempts to take the doll into his church for safekeeping. Yes, it's clear to all that demons are at work here.\nWhile watching this, I waited and wondered for the good stuff to come, the genuine scares. The first hour or so contains little of what might be considered a scare. It's not that the frights are inexpertly presented, it's that there aren't any to speak of. A lot of exposition appears instead. I began to hope that this would all be a setup for a cathartic finale.\nMia becomes friends with a local bookstore owner, Evelyn (Alfre Woodward), who also lives in the Gordons' apartment complex. Coincidentally, Evelyn had lost a child following an auto accident for which Evelyn feels plenty of guilt. This becomes important during the finale, which is over almost before you know it's begun.\nThere's some nifty sleight of hand in Annabelle, but since everyone in the movie (as well as the audience) agrees wholeheartedly that the demon does exist and that Mia isn't imagining things, there's no real suspense to be found. Even husband John goes along with things eventually. Such an understanding husband. Because everyone knows in their heart that these weird things are actually happening, there's no ambiguity about whether Mia is losing her mind. She's not.\nShort on horror and long on talk, Annabelle is a medium-low heat setting on a gas grill. Your food will get cooked eventually, but you may fall asleep waiting for it to come to its inevitable conclusion."}

I didn't catch the 2002 cable version, but I can compare the 1976 theatrical release with last year's offering from director Kim Peirce (Boys Don't Cry), and my feeling is that the newbie acquits itself quite well.\nYou're probably familiar with the plot, since the book has sold millions of copies worldwide. A teenage girl, living with her religious-zealot mother and suffering the scorn of the cool kids at school, discovers she has telekinetic powers that she then uses to exact her revenge for her years of mistreatment. This time, our titular protagonist is played by Chloe Grace Moretz (Kick-Ass), who looks like Amanda Seyfried's slightly younger sister. Carrie has always been viewed as an outsider/freak by most of the school, but things go really far south in the very first scene, when the poor girl gets her first menstrual period \u2013 in the middle of the shower in the girls' locker room. This comes as a major surprise, since her mother (Julianne Moore) has never brought up the subject before. Think the other girls are sympathetic? Brother, you don't know high school girls.\nAfter the girls have had their fun at Carrie's expense, their gym teacher Mrs. Desjardin (Judy Greer) confronts them. As their cheerleader coach, she informs them that they can either run laps (and plenty of them) or be suspended from school for their part in the harassment. Most of the girls comply, because suspension means no prom, and no prom to a high school girl is unthinkable. One girl who doesn't comply is Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday, Youth in Revolt), who has a boyfriend from a different, rougher high school and who is probably from the wrong side of the tracks to begin with. Chris rebels and is consequently suspended, which means no prom for her. Where do you think she places the blame for her situation? Poor Carrie White.\nAnother participant in the hazing incident is Sue Snell (Gabriella Wilde), who feels genuinely guilty and ashamed about her part; this leads her to ask her BMOC boyfriend Tommy Ross (Ansel Elgort) to take Carrie to the prom instead of Sue. Tommy needs to be talked into it, but in the end it's what his girl wants. But things don't go as he, Sue, or Carrie plan.\nChris and Sue, two close friends, react quite differently to their punishments (did I mention that video from the locker room was later posted on YouTube?). Sue, immediately remorseful, decides that not only should she not go to prom, as punishment, she should convince her beloved Tommy to take the tormented Carrie in her stead. Sue, hostile and vindictive, is meanwhile out for revenge, perhaps at any cost.\nA minor quibble might be Moretz. Not her acting, mind you (or that of most of the cast), but rather her appearance; Moretz seems to me to be too attractive for the role of Carrie White. At no point here does Carrie look like an ugly duckling, even before she becomes a swan. Sissy Spacek, in the 1976 version, had more of that plain-Jane look than Moretz can pull off. Still, at least Moretz was still a teenager when this movie was made. Even Doubleday, as Chris, is 26.\nI found Carrie to be appropriately terrifying, much as King probably imagined it when he originally put words to pen. The denouement is spectacularly staged, as are the culmination of the prom and Carrie's interactions with her fanatical mother. The telekinesis scenes are fantastic, a step up from the '76 version. And there's lots of blood. Sure, most of it's came from a pig, but it's blood nonetheless."}

He helps run a bar (paid for by his wife) and alternately plays video games and watches reality television. His marriage to Amy (Rosamund Pike) isn't going so well, after five years; from Nick's perspective, living under the thumb of his trust-fund wife is more than just a chore, it's excruciating. So it's understandable why, when it appears that Amy has been murdered in their home, Nick would be the prime suspect.\nIn David Fincher's Gone Girl, the mystery appear to be not whodunit but rather why they did it and what the endgame really is. It's a little long (143 minutes) and has at least one too many denouements; just when you believe you have a vague handle on how things might go, the movie pivots elsewhere. Now, I'm one of those people who likes to find someone in the movie who has a strong personality, not necessarily a good guy but at least someone with whom I may be able to sympathize (to some degree) or to whom I can relate. I didn't find that to be the case in this film. Let me put it this way - Nick is an arrogant, self-pitying jerk, and Amy is a delusional sociopath. With no rooting interest and no discernible satisfying ending, watching the movie was a tedious experience.\nNick is questioned by Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens), and a missing-persons report is immediately followed. Nick's not sure whether his wife has friends, or what her blood type is, or what she does during the day, all of which cast doubt on his innocence. A press conference is held. A hotline is set up. A midnight vigil is held. All standard operating procedure for a missing-persons case that's less than a day old. But with a real lack of other suspects or motives, the court of public opinion shortly turns against Nick. He's no longer the grieving husband (and son-in-law) but the conniving gold digger with all the necessary reasons for orchestrating his wife's demise. Plus, he has this attitude that oscillates between smug and defensive.\nThe first half of the movie seems rather inert; the audience ping pongs between believing Nick is a villain. There are multiple reasons that indicate he's not all that innocent, although the bottom line is that he's just not a nice guy, and that's reason enough for the cable-TV crowd. After the police turn on Nick as well, a Nancy Grace impressionist (Missi Pyle) calls for his head. Nick turns to high-powered attorney Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry), who advises him to appear on the show of an Oprah Winfrey copycat (Sela Ward). Affleck, through Nick, then turns in his best acting job while pretending to show contrition and humility on the television show.\nGone Girl first asks us to imagine that Nick is blameless, planting the idea that the attack was staged, and then asks us to believe that Amy is just an innocent naif who's on the run from an abusive husband, and then asks us to pity Nick, and then Amy, and so on. The entire movie, although based on a book by Gillian Flynn (who also wrote the screenplay), feels like a Lifetime movie that is itself ripped from tabloid headlines.\nWe do finally get Amy's side of the story, but her situation and intention aren't terribly compelling. She's a meticulous planner, to the point where, in voice-over, she explains in minute detail every step in her scheme. The amount of organization is to be admired - except that later in the movie, she makes a mistake that would have been easily prevented by even a modicum of advance thinking. I found it hard to believe that someone who had gone to such great lengths to achieve her goal would be undone so effortlessly. The entire movie, although based on a book by Gillian Flynn (who also wrote the screenplay), feels like a Lifetime movie that is itself ripped from tabloid headlines.\nBen Affleck has played so many arrogant, smug, condescending jerks in his career that it's hard to imagine him as a vulnerable, mild-mannered guy. In the hands of a more capable actor, the role of Nick Dunne may have become much more nuanced, but instead we get a colorless, stereotypical performance by one of Hollywood's top leading men. It's a true shame, because he's surrounded by excellent performances - particularly by Carrie Coon, who plays his acerbic sister Margo, and Dickens. Both women turn make their characters layered, thoughtful, and ultimately intriguing. This contrasts sharply with Affleck's dismissive, distant style.\nThis normally would be the kind of movie I'd love. The premise asks the question of what has happened to Amy Dunne. A mystery is afoot! But this mystery is solved within the first third of the movie, and the remainder of the film is endless filler. We're teased several times in the final third that this could finally be it, the ending. But it's not. It never is. Even the ending isn't an ending. According to reports, Flynn changed the ending of the script so that readers of the book wouldn't know what was coming. I'm not sure that ploy works, because there is no finale to speak of. There is no twist, just a longer piece of twine."}

When a kindly cop informs him that the murderer of his parents has been released from prison, the young man heads back to his hometown to confront the killer. But things really don't go as expected.\nBlue Ruin is mostly a quick, dirty thriller, but it's also a character study. Dwight Evans (Macon Blair) isn't exactly conflicted about his plan, but he's an amateur assassin at best. It helps the story that Dwight sort of looks like a combination of Thomas Lennon and John Cusack, deceptively small and naive. And perhaps a bit unstable, too. Dwight drives his beat-up rust bucket back home, spies on the nefarious Wade Cleland as he leaves prison, and tails him to a bar. But disposing of Wade won't close any circuits; instead, the web becomes a bit more tangled, the terrain more murky.\nThis is an odyssey, one man's quest for vengeance, but set in a world in which simply finding the bad guy and eliminating him isn't realistic. A lot of things go wrong for poor Dwight, but he's resourceful enough to recalibrate on the fly. Blair is really terrific as Dwight, doing what most of us would at least contemplate doing. His actions may not be pure, but his reasoning and impetus are sound. It's almost as if Dwight carries out his plan in order to soothe his soul. Dwight is also trying to protect his estranged sister (Amy Hargreaves) and her daughters, but the Cleland family, in the middle of Nowheresville, certainly isn't going to sit idly by and let Dwight even up the score.\nThe atmosphere is relentlessly grim, almost overpowering in its intensity. Most attention is paid to Dwight's character (in a couple senses of the word), and thus the film perhaps pays short shrift to ancillary characters, such as Wade's brother Teddy, Dwight's sister Sam, and others of the Cleland clan, including Eve Plumb (who gets I believe one line). Jeremy Saulnier's rough-and-tumble thriller is excellently executed, with a relatable protagonist, a stark setting, and no lingering questions asked."}

The combination of timeless music with Oscar-nominated costume design yields a thematically coherent work of art that spreads its message of love and understanding to great success.\nThe story centers around a Liverpudlian named Jude (Jim Sturgess) who joins the merchant marines and then jumps ship once he gets to the United States, ostensibly to look up his American father. He meets a wild young man named Max (Joe Anderson) who's wreaking havoc on the Harvard campus, and Max's sister Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood), a straight-arrow babe in the woods. Jude and his friends have fun and adventures and suffer the various tragedies of life from the early 1960s through to the early 1970s, pretty much aping how John Lennon spent his time during that period.\nAlmost all of the characters in this story have some sort of Beatles connection. Jude refers to the song \"Hey Jude,\" which itself referred to Lennon's son Julian. Lucy refers to \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,\" and Max refers to \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer.\" But that ain't all. Jude and Max eventually get an apartment together, and their landlady is named Sadie (Dana Fuchs), after \"Sexy Sadie); the character herself is an homage to Janis Joplin. Sadie's musician boyfriend is Jo-Jo, from \"Get Back,\" and he's an homage to Jimi Hendrix. There's a friend named Pru (\"Dear Prudence\"), too. But here's what's really neat. The songs used in the movie aren't shoehorned in there to fit with the characters' names, and vice versa. Director Julia Taymor allows the viewer to become immersed in the world of Jude and Lucy without being distracted by what's really a constant stream of Beatle references.\nThis is not a small achievement, either. From a Cavern Club show to a rooftop performance, there are scores of people, places, and events relating the Lennon and his bandmates, and it doesn't stop there. At one point Jude and the gang get on a bus that's on its way to see Dr. Timothy Leary, just like Ken Kesey's famous transcontinental trek some fifty years ago. There's a musical number devoted to the song \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite,\" and if ever a song really shouted out for a musical number, that's it. Eddie Izzard, of all people, plays the titular Kite, and he's surrounded by Blue Meanies. Trust me, if you're not high when you watch that scene, you'll feel like you are anyway.\nBut at the center of the madness is the beautiful love story of Jude and Lucy, one a struggling artist who is passionate about pacifism and one who supports more proactive protest measures. As one might expect in any time period, their love becomes strained and even vanishes for a while. After all, this isn't a musical rooted in fantasy. Kids are sent off to war in Taymor's vision, and they don't always come back.\nAcross the Universe seems to capture the spirit, the angst, and the hope that embodied the period. It's a bit long, over two hours, but if you do make it to the end you should find the final number to be a real heart stopper. Honest, winning performances from everyone really seal the deal."}

I've seen plenty of Kevin Costner movies, and I'm well aware of his, er, limitations. And maybe I'm in the minority, but I think that if the role he's playing meets those limitations, then he can be a fine actor. His role in 3 Days to Kill, as a CIA killer trying to reconnect with his estranged daughter, is not one of those roles. What we have here is a sentimental action movie that requires a fair amount of emoting - even for an assassin - and that's just not Kevin Costner's idiom.\nEthan Renner (Costner) is dying, and his doctor gives him three months to live. Ethan sets up a will with his estranged wife Christine (Connie Nielsen) with the promise that she not tell their teenage daughter Zoe (Hailee Steinfeld, True Grit). Ethan, who has all the personality of a bowl of oatmeal and a name straight out of Spy Movie Screen writing 101, wants to slip back into his (resentful) daughter's life after leaving her and her mother five years prior, and he figures that since they're all in the same city (Paris, of course), he'll get that chance.\nBut then the clich\u00e9s and stock characters really pile up. Ethan is cornered by another CIA agent, a Vivi (Amber Heard), who says she has a super-secret drug that'll cure Ethan's malady, but in exchange she wants him to find the notorious, the nefarious Albino and his boss, The Wolf. He has three days to find the men and bring them to justice - one way or another! - and simultaneously watching over Zoe while her mom is away on business.\nAsking the stone-faced Costner to do much other than appear disinterested is a tall order, and it doesn't help that the two villains are both lame, generic knockoffs. So the action part isn't very...well, active. The dramatic part, the tension between Zoe and her dad, is a bit better, but even it is hampered by a way-too-snotty attitude on the part of the teen that abruptly morphs into a sweet little lamb. In fact, all three female leads (Nielsen, Heard, Steinfeld) are fun to watch, picking up the tempo and the mood of each scene in which they appear, which sadly isn't all of them.\nCostner being Costner is fine for some movies, like Open Range or Bull Durham, but when the script requires more personality, he's just not the optimal choice. 3 Days to Kill, though, isn't interesting enough to distinguish itself from others of its kind, even if Costner's sleepy performance is factored out."}

It's one of those increasingly rare movies that make excellent use of such quaint amenities as setting and atmosphere to instill a real sense of panic, courage, determination, and fear in even the most disaffected teenager. It's tightly paced, with few logical inconsistencies to nitpick, too.\nIt all begins when Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) wakes up to find himself in a rapidly ascending elevator stocked with what appear to be provisions of some kind. When the elevator stops and the top is opened, he discovers that he's the latest arrival in an all-boys community that's at the center of a giant, ever-changing, complex stone maze. The boys, some of whom have been there for a long time, have established a pacifistic community that relies on those monthly provisions and their own hard work (building shelters, low-level farming) to survive.\nBut that maze. It's enormous and inscrutable. There are specialists, called Runners, who enter the maze each morning in order to map it and to try to find a way out. But if they don't return by dusk, the maze's stone doors will close, leaving the hapless teens inside for the night. And no one has ever spent a night in the maze and survived.\nThis is the ominous, bleak scenario with which young Thomas is presented. Alby (Aml Ameen), the leader of the crew, explains that there are only three rules in The Glade, that happy little faux-Paradise in which they all live: do your part, don't hurt another Glade resident, and don't feed them after midnight. Wait, sorry, that last one is from Gremlins. I meant that Gladers (uh huh) are forbidden to go into the maze. Well, unless they happen to be Runners.\nSo, once a month they get new supplies and a new young dude. But once Thomas arrives, things start to be a little different in the Glade. A runner is stung by a Griever (they're nasty robotic creatures who lurk in the maze) in broad daylight. Stings aren't good - they incapacitate the stung person and imbue them with violent tendencies. As such, he who has been stung is necessarily banished from The Glade, for the safety of the rest of the clan.\nThomas isn't like everyone else, as the somewhat-hotheaded Gally (Will Poulter, Chronicles of Narnia: The Dawn Treader) is quick to point out. Gally notices that things seem a little off since Thomas's arrival, and he blames the greenie for disrupting what felt like a little slice of heaven. But on Thomas's side are Alby, Alby's second in command Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), and the most-recent new blood, a young boy named Chuck (Blake Cooper), who looks a lot like Chunk from The Goonies.\nSomething has changed with Thomas's arrival; it seems that whoever or whatever is behind the maze's creation is changing the rules. For one thing, an unscheduled arrival of the elevator yields a new member for the group: a girl. The first one, in fact. It's Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), who appears to know Thomas from before their time in The Glade. Both Thomas and Theresa have dreams regarding their \"before time\" - again, unlike the others.\nThomas is acutely aware that the existence of the group in The Glade is not necessarily permanent, as evidenced by the attacking Grievers and the various infighting of the Gladers. Thomas wishes to find out more, and Gally simply doesn't, content to keep things as they are. This is the crux of the movie's moral issue - is it better to keep what one has, even if one has little and under repressive conditions, or to strive to escape those conditions on the hope of finding a better life elsewhere? Leaving aside the morality of having teenagers battle robot-animal hybrids (goodness knows we've seen plenty of movies about kids killing enemies or each other lately), the eternal question of why the boys and Teresa are even in The Glade lingers over them all. It's just that Gally and his small band of followers don't want to know the answer, and Thomas and his desperately do.\nThe action is fierce and creative. Even the battles with various Grievers are well shot (sometimes tough to do with robots, because with so much activity it can be difficult to discern what's what and who's who, particularly in a low-light setting), and the maze is something to behold - a real work of art, were it real. The acting is better than might be expected for a young-adult film, and O'Brien, Brodie-Sangster, and Poulter are each well cast.\nIt's obvious that The Maze Runner is intended to be a franchise - if it enjoys box-office success, of course. If this turns out to be another Golden Compass, then this may be the only Maze Runner movie we see. Which is a shame, because there are plenty of dangling plot lines at the end. Even so, the movie is exciting and persuasive and doesn't try to dumb itself down for the sake of its audience."}

This is an undemanding, entertaining little film that relies most heavily on its actors' fine performances.\nWillie (jazz musician John Lurie) is a hipster, at least as much of one as 1984 had to offer. He lives in a tiny, tiny apartment in New York, and he's expecting his cousin Eva (Eszter Balint, recently seen in a story arc on Louie) to arrive from Hungary and spend the night before heading to Ohio to live with their aunt. But poor Aunt Dottie (Cecillia Stark) will be in the hospital for the next fortnight, so Eva necessarily crashes with Willie. Willie's miffed that his blossoming (untrue) social life will take a hit with Eva around, and he treats his cousin with some scorn, like an unwanted puppy. Soon, Willie's friend Eddie (Richard Edson) shows up, and he's a kinder, gentler (if submissive) version of Willie.\nIn the second act, Eva has left for Ohio, but after a year the guys miss her and, after winning some money in a fixed poker game, head out to visit. But, bored (again) with Ohio, they head to Florida with Eva for some deserved rest and relaxation.\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of this superficially uncomplex film is the way the trio's interrelationships develop. Willie becomes more tolerant of Eva, to the point where he's willing to drive from New York to Ohio to visit. And as time progresses, Willie and Eddie are more on even ground with each other (Eddie becomes more assertive).\nThis isn't a movie about nothing, but it's a close approximation. Lurie and Balint mesh well together. Balint's Eva is neither a shrinking violet (being new to the country and all) nor a pugnacious harridan. She's smarter than she looks - and certainly wiser than Willie and Eddie. But the other two aren't one dimensional, either, as Jarmusch's efficient script allows each to grow and to communicate so much by saying so little.\nStranger Than Paradise is a beautiful little movie, filmed in black and white to better illustrate the inevitable hopelessness the characters endure. It's one of those cases in which less is truly more, as Jarmusch's immersive atmosphere lightly complements the strong acting from the three leads."}

It's the story of a ragtag band of five heroes fighting against evil in the universe. The fact that one of them is a raccoon and other is a tree is immaterial, as is the fact that each of them is a criminal of little repute. Point is, they're good guys taking on the evil Ronan, a being who seeks a legendary Infinity Stone, an ancient artifact that can grant the possessor devastating powers (and often death).\nThe Infinity Stone is held inside something called the Orb, about the size of a softball. The Stone itself is a gem on the same order as the Cosmic Cube seen in Captain America: The First Avenger. So, yes, the universe in which The Guardians exist is the same one in which Cap and the rest of the Avengers exist. Seeking the Orb is Ronan (Lee Pace), at the behest of the mighty Thanos (an uncredited Josh Brolin) so that Thanos will help eradicate the planet Xandor for him. In any event, it's a middling thief named Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), aka Star Lord, who grabs the Orb himself in a cave on an abandoned planet. Ronan's thugs, led by Korath (Djimon Hounsou), attack Quill, but the latter manages to escape in his chrome spaceship. \nQuill tries to sell the Orb to a broker, but when it's learned that Ronan is involved, the broker declines, which leads to Gamora (Zoe Saldana), a green-skinned assassin, attacking Peter in order to retrieve the Orb, under the orders of Thanos, her adopted father. Ah, but at the same time, two bounty hunters - a riotous raccoon named Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and a sentient tree named Groot (Vin Diesel) spot Quill, who by this time is a very, very wanted man. They, too, join the m\u00eal\u00e9e, but all four of them wind up captured and sent to a high-security prison called Kyln, which seems like a combination of \"killing\" and \"kiln,\" and which in any event looks like a bad place to be. And, if you're Gamora, it is, because she's Thanos' daughter, and much of the criminals in Kyln have had their planets, homes, and families destroyed by Thanos. It is also at Kyln that our quartet meets up with the fifth member of their tribe: Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), who has a personal vendetta against Ronan. Drax is huge, sort of blue, and is deeply sensitive - although he has no idea how metaphors work.\nNot only is the action fast paced, the dialog - perfectly delivered by a top-notch cast - is terrific and hilarious. Sure, a prevailing theme is the old chestnut about people from diverse backgrounds coming together to fight a common enemy, but think of this as a higher-tech Star Wars, except with fewer robots. There are cultural references to the 80s (when Quill was abducted, as a young boy, from Earth), too. The chemistry among all of the leads is spot on; with each taking turns at saving the lives of the others. Even the plant-like Groot, who's often described as the muscle of the operations, shows plenty of savvy and a willingness to sacrifice himself to save others. There may be a lesson there somewhere.\nAlong with Pratt, Saldana, Bautista, and the voices of Diesel and Cooper, the supporting cast features Benicio del Toro as a collector of rare objects, Hounsou, Michael Rooker as a fellow scoundrel to Peter Quill, John C. Reilly as a Xandorian official, and Glenn Close as Nova Prime (ruler of Xandor).\nIn the end, good things happen. It's a comic-book movie, for goodness sake, so that's not a spoiler. But it's not really the end. Guardians of the Galaxy is a huge success as a standalone movie, and it leads into not only its own sequel but also that of The Avengers. If you look closely, you can spot some remnants of other Marvel Comics, items that may (or may not) indicate who or what will be involved in future cinematic stories from the studio. \nGuardians of the Galaxy is certainly fit to be in the same, ahem, universe inhabited by other blockbuster superhero films, like The Avengers, Thor, and Iron Man. It's visceral entertainment."}

It's a shortish film (78 minutes) that manages to plod along until a big reveal is made about halfway through the movie; then, just as it arouses some interest, it becomes a frustrating exercise in nonlinear storytelling. That's a shame, because the left turn that the plot makes at that midway point could have opened up a world of possibilities. It's even possible that the idea introduced in the movie could have been expanded more efficiently to cut down on some incoherence and unnecessary overplotting.\nThis is one of those movies that's tough to summarize without giving away crucial parts of the plot. So let's try for a gist instead. Four friends, who work for the same corporation during the day, also work together nights and weekends on pet science projects. Two of the friends, Abe and Aaron, decide to work on a project independently of their comrades after the foursome disagrees about which direction the group's interests should follow. The project that Abe and Aaron work on, in Aaron's garage, is to design technology that allows physical objects to lose weight. But as with much scientific studies, the research has some unintended consequences, yielding an invention that's beyond the wildest imagination of Abe and Aaron.\nThat they make this discovery is pretty awesome, and the subsequent efforts to harness/utilize the discovery, even profit from it are plausible and sincere. But for me, the movie had two major flaws, one for each half of the film. In the first half, much of the necessary exposition comes in the form of dialogue, often between Abe and Aaron. However, a pervasive characteristic of the dialogue is that each character routinely talks over the others. Considering the complexity of the plot, it was a little frustrating to hear a lot of dialogue that simply couldn't be parsed. This made it quite difficult to follow even the genesis of the plot, let alone the complications that follow. In the second half, after the Great Reveal gives the viewer a whole new movie, there are so many strands of logic and off-screen permutations that again, it's easy to get lost. And because the characters weren't sharing everything with each other (or the audience) anyway, there's so much confusion here. So, so much confusion. But that's what the Internet's for."}

But one night a year, the country's fine citizens are permitted to commit any crime they wish, without penalty, including murder. It's the ultimate way to blow off steam. Twelve hours of mayhem, and then the population surplus is reduced. That's life with The Purge.\nThe Purge - the event, not the movie - is sold as a good thing, something that keeps everyone in harmony for the other 364 days in the year. No crime? Almost everyone's employed? All due to The Purge, apparently. Some see it with a more cynical eye, though; those who can afford to defend themselves, their family, and their property against the onslaught of violence will probably be just fine. But those who live in the poorer sections of their city...well, they're there to be Purged.\nJames Sandin (Ethan Hawke) lives with his family in a gated community. James sells security systems, which as you might guess becomes a lucrative business around the time of The Purge each year, on March 21. The Sandin family has a very nice, expansive house, nestled among a plethora of other \"haves.\" Thus James, wife Mary (Lena Headey), son Charlie (Max Burkholder), and daughter Zoey (Adelaide Kane) feel safe, removed from the anarchy of the annual ritual.\nUntil, of course, a still-unsure-if-he-supports-The-Purge Charlie decides, after the sirens have signaled the beginning of the madness, to let a bloody homeless man (Edwin Hodge of As Above, So Below) into their home. Ooh, bad call. See, some devout, well-armed Purgers are looking for the guy, and sure enough the Sandins' neighbors have ratted them out as harboring the guy. Does James hand over the man, or do the mercenaries take the house by force? Like You're Next, The Purge centers on a group of people being attacked unexpectedly. James does have weapons, but it's quickly apparent that his security system is more of a nominal deterrent than anything. The villains find it surprisingly easy to get inside. And with the lights out - yep, no power except for the generator that's somehow powering only the multiple cameras - and the family separated from each other, it's utter chaos at Chez Sandin.\nAlso like You're Next, there's a nifty twist at the end. Sort of makes up for plot holes or just missing information. Here's a question: Since all weapons at Level 4 and below are legal during The Purge (and presumably illegal the rest of the year), how do law-enforcement officials discern whether a higher-grade weapon has been used outside of the annual Purge? It's not explicit in the movie, but I guess crimefighting is just that good in the future. But then I was thinking, what if it's good by virtue of instilling fear in the populace? That might control everyone for much of a year, but when it came time for The Purge, wouldn't cops be the first ones on the firing line? (Note: in a prologue voice-over, we're informed that elected officials have immunity.) The Purge offers some interesting food for thought. Would you be willing to live in a complete police state in order to have a crime-free society with jobs for everyone? On the plus side, you get to steal/vandalize/rape/pillage/murder to your heart's content. On the negative side, you could be the victim of all of that and not live to see another Purge. Kind of a dilemma, eh? But make no mistake, this isn't a movie that dwells on heavy issues. It's a thriller designed to shock and entertain, and to that end The Purge does a bloody good job."}

And one of his fellow assassins is Angelina Jolie. So it's basically a fantasy aimed at shlubby white males.\nMcAvoy's Wesley is an office drone who takes medication for his anxiety and is bullied by his abusive stapler-clicking boss and whose buddy (played by Chris Pratt) has been boinking Wesley's harpy girlfriend. He lives in an apartment alongside an elevated railroad. His life sucks. So you can imaging his surprise when he's confronted by a mysterious woman named Fox (Jolie) while getting his prescription filled. A man has tracked him to the drugstore, she purrs, and he's about to kill you. A shootout ensues. Fox and Wesley escape, and he's brought to a textile factory to meet the suave Mr. Sloan, who gives Wesley the lowdown on his origins (every hero needs one) and gives him a motive \u2013 to find and assassinate the man who murdered his father.\nBut before that can happen, we must endure a training montage. Wesley learns how to fight with knives \u2013 and gets plenty of slices of his own. Wesley learns how to take a punch while being tied to a chair. Wesley learns how to fire a gun so that the bullet curves around obstacles. You know, standard-issue stuff. And then he's ready! Wait, no he's not. Sloan makes him do some killin' missions. You know, to keep up appearances with the other assassins. The basic idea is that the looms in the textile factory contain coded messages that, when decoded, provide the name of the assassin group's next target.\nThe story is based on a comic book, or graphic novel, whichever is appropriate, so suspension of disbelief is paramount. Take the idea behind curving bullets. Or that Wesley can suddenly get ripped and become great at hand-to-hand fighting. Or that there's a magical soaking tub that heals everything from scratches to broken bones. Gotta just buy into it. Fail to do so at your own peril, is what I'm getting at here.\nAnyway, I liked the movie. A lot of exhilarating action, and then there's Jolie. Hardly says a word for the first hour of the movie. Easy work if you can get it. Come to think of it, she doesn't say much in the movie, and I'm betting a stunt double helped in some of the action scenes. Now that's a good career choice.\nWanted was as outlandishly high energy as one might expect, so I'd recommend it for action movie fans, or comic-book fans, and especially Jolie fans."}

Which is a good thing, seeing as how it's a cartoon aimed at little kids. And me, naturally. This was right up my alley.\nIt's a simple story. That wonderful machine created by Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) that bestowed food falling from the sky for the island town of Swallow Falls has been deactivated, thanks to a plethora of food and a desire for people not to be harmed by chunks of sustenance dropping on them. Now the island must be cleaned up, and the corporation Live Corp., run by Flint's idol Chester V (Will Forte) gets the contract. The town's citizens are relocated temporarily while Flint realizes his lifelong dream and becomes an employee at Live Corp. The problem? It seems that the food created by the machine has become...sentient. And it's fighting back! Flint and his friends - Sam Sparks (Anna Faris), cameraman Manny (Benjamin Bratt), policeman Earl (Terry Crews, stepping in for Mr. T), Chicken Brent (Andy Samberg), Steve the Monkey, and Flint's dad Tim (James Caan) - head back to the island. The mission: locate the machine and shut it down. But it seems that Chester and his orangutan assistant Barb (Kristen Schaal) have other plans, plans too devious to mention in detail here, lest your eyes be singed.\nAnyway, here's the cool thing. The sentient foodstuffs are basically tangible portmanteaus of food and animal, like the wild tacodile, the watermelephant, the pie-thon, the cheespider, and the bananostrich. Luckily, most of these creatures were benign to begin with. I mean, there aren't any lions or tigers or bears or scorpions. Now, setting aside the question of what these Foodimals would eat, since they themselves are made up of food, these are creative inventions. Almost makes you want to buy one or two as stuffed animals.\nMeanwhile, back at the boat, Tim bonds with sentient pickles over fishing. I swear, I am so glad this movie was rooted in reality. I mean, sure, pickles probably couldn't cast that well, but still - kudos are deserved here.\nThis is about Flint's needing to choose between his idol and his friends and family, between doing what he knows will help his inventing career and what he knows is right. It's about being reminded about those closest to you, lest you disdain their influence. It's also about being able to change one's mind in light of new evidence, and it's about not killing anything that has eyes and/or talks. It's also about 95 minutes.\nHader is terrific, as is the supporting cast, even when they're not given much to do but run and hide. Or cackle evilly. I was more impressed with the vocalizations of the Foodimals, such as Barry the strawberry or the pickles, voiced by codirector Cody Cameron. Kind of thought Frank Welker had stumbled on set.\nNo meatballs, ironically enough."}

James Rankin connects the murders instead to a doctor who performed the autopsy on the condemned man and who was present at the burial. Naturally, his investigation takes him down a twisted path in which he more or less becomes the strangler himself.\nAt first, this seems like a typical low-budget Karloff horror movie, but in addition to his talents it has a couple of things going for it \u2013 one is the transformation from normal Mr. Rankin into the Strangler, and another is the major plot twist about three-fourths of the way into the movie. Seriously, did not see that coming. I clearly underestimated the depth of this plot.\nKarloff doesn't ham it up, slowly evolving from a calm, thoughtful chap into an unhinged obsessive, and he's surrounded by capable actors (Elizabeth Allen, Anthony Dawson, Tim Turner).

This would be Spike Lee's 2013 remake, not the original Korean masterpiece. Josh Brolin stars as a man who's inexplicably imprisoned for 20 years and then, just as inexplicably, allowed to escape. Also among the cast are Elizabeth Olsen as a kind-hearted clinic worker and Samuel L. Jackson as himself. (Okay, not really.) The trouble? If you've seen the original bloody mess (in a good way), then you have no reason to see this. Much like Gus van Sant's remake of Psycho in 1998, 2013\u2032s Oldboy is pretty much the same as its predecessor. That's fine if you're making a horror movie, maybe, or an action movie \u2013 films that can skate by with gaps in plot. But if one of the highlights of the premise is a shocking twist, then either you're counting on your audience not having seen the original or you think it doesn't matter even if they have. True, Chang-wook Park's movie was in Korean with subtitles, but it had (and continues to have) a strong cult following in the U.S. as a visceral, alarming masterpiece with a truly malicious twist ending. That's what made that movie so special. Spike Lee's version merely copies a winning formula, but if people have an idea of what the out-of-left-field plot twist is, the impact of that twist is somewhat blunted.\nHere's a second problem. In the original, the violence is over the top camp. In the remake, it's less over the top and more of a cheesefest. Picture this \u2013 one iconic scene in both films has our protagonist trying to escape from the evil clutches of his captors. Seemingly scores of henchmen pour out of elevators and doors, trapping our man in a hallway. In Park's version, the bloodletting seems to be intentionally comical. In Lee's version, it just looks comically stupid. You don't have to slow down the DVD to notice that, while waiting their turn to attack, the thugs will jump up, down, ahead, back, to give the impression that they're in on the action. If Lee was trying to poke fun at how a group of crooks never attacks all at once, then lack of subtlety hurts the scene; instead of a fine tweak with a wrench, we get bludgeoned with a sledgehammer.\nAs the movie progressed, I kept in mind the Big Twist. As I noted above, it's still there, essentially unchanged. I'm not sure what Lee could have done to make his twist differ, even a little, from Park's twist. Maybe there was nothing to do. In which case, my question is simple \u2013 Why remake the movie in the first place? Brolin is really good and carries the film in some scenes. Olsen is even better here than she was in Martha Marcy May Marlene; she has a strong screen presence and more than holds her own with Brolin (and Jackson, although they have scant time together). The problem here isn't the acting. The problem is the writing and the directing. This Oldboy is generic, lifeless, and redundant."}

This is no Die Hard or Rambo; it's more like an old Jeff Speakman or Wings Hauser movie, at least in terms of plot. There is that magnificent cast, however, so if you like seeing a lot of interesting actors in the same movie, this might be the one for you \u2013 even if most of the cast is pretty close to collecting Social Security. Well, if they needed to, anyway.\nBarney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) takes his team to snag a high-profile arms dealer at the behest of the CIA (in the person of a Mr. Drummer, played by Harrison Ford). On the way, they break an old pal of Barney's, Doc (Wesley Snipes), an original Expendable himself. But trouble awaits when they get to their destination and discover that \u2013 dun dun DUN \u2013 the mystery man is actually Barney's old partner Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson), who Barney thought he'd killed years ago. Yeah, maybe he didn't do that after all. Anyway, Stonebanks fights back, and one of Barney's guys is wounded. They pull back, and Barney reassesses the situation. His solution \u2013 get rid of the current team (Jason Statham, Randy Couture, Terry Crews, Dolph Lundgren) in favor of a younger, hungrier squad (including Glen Powell, Victor Ortiz, Kellan Lutz, and Ronda Rousey) to avenge his wounded mate and take down his ex-partner. Because a third movie in a franchise full of old guys desperately needs a change in direction, you see.\nPredictably, the new guys are a little eclectic (one's a woman! one's a hacker!) for old-school Barney, and just as predictably the old guard resents being let go. Ah, what the hell, let's all go! So everyone goes to beat up Mel Gibson; even Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger) shows up. Of course, Gibson being the super bad guy and all, he has an actual army awaiting them \u2013 I believe it was the Azerbaijan military. These guys, who apparently have nothing else to do but attack 10-15 in an abandoned hotel, have tanks, helicopters, RPGs, you name it. I don't want to spoil it for you, but the good guys sort of hold their own. I know, it's a twist.\nIt's a violent movie, but it's rated PG-13. There are few curse words spoken. At least I think that was the case, because I was distracted by the family of four a row behind me, what with their toddler and four- year-old kid in tow who never shut up. Who takes little kids to The Expendables? These guys. Anyway. It's almost a shame that this wasn't R rated, because we could have had ourselves a relatively good movie. Blood and guts and veins in my teeth, that sort of movie. But no, this one got toned down so much that the writers had to rely on the actors, and come on. These guys aren't actors so much as positionable action figures. There isn't much witty repartee, either, although there are a few nods to earlier movies \u2013 catchphrases from Schwarzenegger and Stallone, for example. Or to Snipes' personal life.\nThe Expendables 3 was not a terrible movie, and I appreciate that. Good job on the filmmakers for not stinking too much. But this probably is one that can wait for home video. That is, if parts 1 and 2 left you with so many unanswered questions."}

Even with a big budget, Aronofsky doesn't ignore the importance of plot development and deftly avoids painting his characters as either Good or Bad.\nThe story begins with Noah (Russell Crowe) seeing his father Lamech (Martin Csokas) murdered by Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone). Tubal-cain is a descendant of Cain, who killed his brother Abel and fled east; Noah is a direct descendant of Seth, also brother to Cain. Noah, unseen by Tubal-cain, escapes; he later marries Naameh (Jennifer Connelly), and they have three boys: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Noah begins to have visions of the end of the world, and when he sees a flower grow where no seed could previously find purchase, he becomes convinced that his Creator (God is never mentioned in the movie) has decided to destroy Man but has chosen to spare Noah and his family - and the innocent creatures of nature. Thus the family, with orphan Ila (Emma Watson) in tow, joins forces with The Watchers - fallen angels turned to anthropomorphic rock - to build an ark to survive a deluge that will wipe out the rest of mankind.\nBut this is not merely a conflict of man versus the elements. Noah believes he's been chosen to facilitate the extermination of all mankind, so he tells his family that after the storm, his sons are to bury him and Naameh and then kill themselves. Complicating this further is Ila, who forces Noah into a terrifying dilemma. Noah, in Aronofsky's view, is by no means a hero. He is, however, quite human and prey to self-doubt and misinterpretation of his Creator's wishes. Should all mankind be eradicated, allowing the plants and animals full domain over the planet? The conflict is handled quite nimbly thanks to the usual strong portrayal by Crowe. Watson and Connelly offer strong support, Connelly particularly indomitable. Maybe having Tubal-cain as an additional antagonist was overkill, but what Aronofsky really focuses on is the family quarrels between Noah and Naameh, Noah and Ham, Noah and Shem, Noah and Ila, and Noah and himself. The family may survive the great flood, but their actions lead to some agonizing decisions and situations.\nSo Aronofsky chooses to use these internal conflicts as the impetus for the movie rather than go by the traditional Biblical story. That is, the story is more or less intact, but it's often secondary to how Noah deals with his kin. This makes Noah not just a huge spectacle to wow even the least devout but also a deep psychological journey, similar to Aronofsky's earlier works."}

It's a long, long train, stocked with all the comforts of life, but there's much more than meets the eye. Well, if you're looking at the train from the outside, anyway. Inside, a terrifying class system has erupted. The movie is classic visceral action, bloody and unbowed, brimming with excellent fight scenes and not-so-quiet desperation.\nThe human race is basically extinct because of an ill-fated idea (some 17 years before the events depicted in the film) to combat the effects of global warming by dispersing a special gas in the upper atmosphere. Rather than solve the planet's environmental woes, the gas froze Earth, killing off all life \u2013 except those in the train, of course. Now the self-sustaining locomotive chugs onward past a bitterly cold landscape.\nThe train is run by Wilford (Ed Harris), a man who apparently had the foresight to built a metric ton of track all over the world. Many people paid a pretty penny to be passengers, and when the frost finally hit, many others were able to glom on for survival. Trouble is, those poor souls are kept in the rear car of the train, subsisting on gelatinous protein bars, in utter squalor. One of these souls is Curtis (Chris Evans), who carefully plans a coup against Wilford's minions, who include Tilda Swinton as Mason, a liaison between the haves and the have-nots. Curtis's best pal is Edgar (Jamie Bell), a punch-first Irishman with a lotta spunk to go with his brogue; others include the ancient Gilliam (John Hurt), who's missing an arm and a leg, and Tanya (Octavia Spencer), mother to a precocious five year old.\nCurtis's plan is simple. Overpower the guards (the tail-section people outnumber them) and then use the skills of Namgoong Minsoo (Kang-ho Song) to open each subsequent door, or gate. Each car in the train serves a different purpose \u2013 water supply, food supply, and so on. It's a long journey, longer than you'd think walking the length of a train would be. And they better not mess up, either, lest a Wilford minion stick their arms out of windows into the frozen air \u2013 the easier to chop them off, you see. (That's why so many are missing limbs.) Where Snowpiercer excels is in its personalization of Curtis's situation. We're not in his head, but we can understand why he's so driven, why he so desperately wants to get his fellow downtrodden to a better place, one where the food and water is plentiful. For the viewer, the excitement builds with each car \u2013 what's behind door #4? Bad guys with machetes? Or maybe a nice garden? I liked Snowpiercer because of Evans' unflinching performance. He's practically the opposite of Captain America here, so he's fairly unrecognizable. His Curtis seems surprisingly strong for a guy who's been eating Jell-O bars for 17 years, but still. The action is fast and furious, and the body count is high. You might well wonder, too, why the train has to perpetually be in motion. I don't recall it bluntly stated in the film, but I guess the same mechanism that propels the train also sustains the life inside (i.e., clean air, electricity). So there's that.\nAt times, the action is so frenetic that it's tough to tell who's smacking whom, whether it's bad guy versus good guy or just discerning between two good guys. In low lighting, a lot of these fellas look the same.\nWhat does it all mean? Perhaps the ending is a little too concrete or literal. You have all of these people on a huge, lumbering train that's going nowhere as fast as possible, and the denouement may leave viewers a little empty, as if some existential point should have been made. But whatever the conclusion, the journey is an exciting blast of adrenaline.\nSnowpiercer: ***"}

It's about a young man who wanders through a dream, unable to wake up, encountering multiple deep thinkers who pontificate about the meaning of life, the universe, and everything.\nIt's directed by Richard Linklater, who is quite the auteur when it comes to off-beat movies, and it's similar to the director's later film A Scanner Darkly (2005). Waking Life is rotoscope animated, and the result is truly stunning. Often, the tone of a scene is matched by the animation style, which does vary from scene to scene, be it a stark, angular setting or a wobbly, unsettled conversation. It's tough to overstate how technically exemplary this movie is; without the animation, perhaps, the film could seem unaccessible by those who dislike excessive talking in their films. Instead, the visual style complements the dialogue (often, monologue). Think of Waking Life as My Dinner with Andre, only with more characters and compelling art direction. This isn't just two dudes discussing life over dinner; it's practically an out-of-body experience for both the viewer and our protagonist.\nAmong those characters encountered in the movie are Celine (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) from Linklater's \"Before\" trilogy, activist Alex Jones, director Steven Soderbergh, Speed Levitch, actor Caveh Zahedi, composer Guy Forsyth, writer Kim Krizan, and Linklater himself. And did you know that in dreams, if you flip a light switch, nothing happens? That's how you know you're in a dream. Also, in dreams, our brains cannot accurately interpret digital numbers, so an alarm clock looks all weirdly disjointed. Sort of how we feel in a dream, I guess. Our protagonist, played by Wiley Wiggins, wakes up a few times from a dream, only to find he's in another dream. Some serious Inception going on there. He's experiencing lucid dreaming, where he can recognize faces and hold conversations at length and then remember it when he awakes, if that happens. \nThe discussions aren't just about dreams, though; topics include language, existentialism itself, conditioning of the human species, the length of an instant, and reincarnation. Linklater and his cohorts have a way of orating that doesn't come off as so much mumbo-jumbo, or as condescension, or as a lecture. Wondrous to behold, Waking Life is a pensive work of art."}

A tech at one of these companies also smuggles the fresh virii out of his building by injecting himself; trouble arises when the celebrity unexpectedly dies, leaving the staffer little time to learn what went wrong before he suffers the same fate.\nSyd March (Caleb Landry Jones) is that tech, Syd. He's got a pretty sweet gig, selling the virii he harvests to pirates who then alternately inject people with the virus (for a nice price) and grow the equivalent of steaks - really! - with the pathogens for their customers' dining pleasure. How does he do this? Volume! No, actually, what the company does is inject the virus into a machine that essentially copy protects the virus, making the virus proprietary. His company, the Lucas Clinic, is contracted to take blood from dying celeb Hannah Geist (Sarah Gadon), and Syd injects himself and quickly becomes disoriented, weak, and feverish. When Syd attempts to remove the copy protection by using his own machine, the console is destroyed.\nIt is a story that shines a bright, infected light on society's devotion to all things celebrity. How far would a superfan go to be a part of a famous person's life? Would they infect themselves with noncontagious herpes? Chew on a regrown kidney? You know something...I think they would, at least the more deranged and sociopathic fans. Such a connection is exponentially stronger than a simple autographed photo. You've not just been recognized by them; you are part of them.\nThe director is one Brandon Cronenberg, son of David, and the son has the same predilection for the macabre as the father. The obsession with celebrities, all too apparent in real life, is shown to be pretty normal in the film's fictional universe, and yet the horror of playing with the fire of fast-spreading pathogens undercuts this seeming normalcy with an almost Jones' Syd pretends to be just another hustler, but he's really as demented as his customers (and clients). Jones plays Syd perfectly as a shady, somewhat-sullen man of little distinction; also noteworthy are Joe Pingue as Arvid (employee of the celebrity meat market), Wendy Crewson as the head of a rival pathogen company, and Malcolm McDowell, playing yet another doctor, this time with skin grafts from his favorite celebrity.\nAntiviral is a horror mystery, with buckets of blood and oodles of intrigue. It's a creepy allegory of man's lust for fame of any kind, viewed through a prism of late-1980s Canadian horror. It's a fine, engrossing film."}

Their not-a-third-wheel partner, O (Blake Lively) is a free spirit surfer girl who loves both of them, because that sort of thing happens in real life.

The boys are split about whether this is a good idea, as ex-soldier Chon wants to take the fight to the Mexicans and bookish Ben wants to maximize profits and minimize blood.

But it's close. What follows isn't really a precise plan or even a grunting, against-all-odds attack but rather a whimpering, half-assed rescue attempt that probably succeeds, if we're being honest - even though O herself says in the first scene (in voice over) that she may very well be dead.\nTaylor-Johnson, who's grown up a tad since Kick-Ass, and Kitch are both pretty good, with neither playing a caricature more than a character.

He's not a likable chap, this Julian. He likes his liquor strong and his girls young, if you know what I mean. After a job in Mexico City, Julian learns he may be on his way out of his amorphous organization; he then bumps into Danny Wright (Kinnear), a businessman who believes he's just made a successful pitch to a local company. Julian comes off as kind of a rude jerk who may or not be telling the truth, but once he convinces (truthfully) Danny that he (Julian) is indeed a paid assassin, the two sort of become pals.\nIt's a typical mismatched-buddies scenario - the loner and the married man, the odd duck and the straight arrow. Danny is married to Bean (Hope Davis), who becomes a little starstruck herself when she learns of Julian's occupation. But what of Julian's future? Will he soon be rubbed out by one of his own coworkers? This seems like a role tailor made for Brosnan, kind of a down-on-his-luck James Bond, but for some reason the character is a nasty, tough-to-read creep. Is he sincere or a sociopath? Is he being funny or deadly serious? When he pulls the old messing-with-you trope once too often, you start to wonder what he's all about - and you get no real satisfactory answers.\nThe twist is okay, but in even a decent thriller it would have been terrific. Here it's just sort of there, as if the writers had realized they needed to tack on something a little off the beaten path and just kind of shoehorned it into the story. The Matador isn't incomprehensible, it's just maddeningly incoherent."}

It's appropriately menacing and worthwhile.\nLee plays the Duc de Richleau (good name), who, along with Rex van Ryn (played by Leon Greene) is the ward of a certain Simon Aron (Patrick Mower). Rex and the Duc drop by Simon's pad (it's 1968, after all), only to discover that Simon's throwing a party with 12 of his friends, all of whom seem a bit shady. One of the friends is Tanith Carlisle (Nike Arrighi), who catches ol' Rex's eye.\nThe Duc suspects that Simon has been recruited to join a Satan-worshipping cult (hence 13 at the party), and luckily for all of us, he knows a little of the black magic himself. So it's a race to save the soul of Simon and of, naturally, Tanith from the evil clutches of the high priest, Mocata. Mocata is played by Charles Gray, who later would appear as Blofeld in Diamonds Are Forever and as The Criminologist in the cult classic Rocky Horror Picture Show, and he has a truly nefarious glare that he makes frequent use of. Lee, of course, also played a Bond villain - in The Man with the Golden Gun. Nice coincidence.\nThere's sacrifices, mutilation, possession, kidnapping, mind control, astral projection. Hey, for a lesser-known Hammer film, it's a pretty impressive production. For the first half of the movie, at least one person steadfastly doesn't believe in devil worshippers, but in the second half everyone's cool with the idea.

The parents fall asleep, and when they awake it's almost dark with no sign of the kids. The police are called, but because of the lack of light the search is put off until the morning. Felix and Sol blame each other and themselves and argue, suffering a sleepless night.\nThe next morning, though, good news: Adolfo and Sara have been found.

They're largely uncommunicative with their parents but have seemingly formed a stronger bond with each other. Around this time, Sol discovers some oddities about her daughter's entry into puberty and becomes quite suspicious.\nThere's a lot of atmosphere here and not an overwhelming amount of dialog (it's in Spanish, with subtitles), both of which I consider pluses. What's up with the kids? Is someone or something controlling them? Probably. Are they in danger? Very likely. Sol becomes more frantic with each revelation, and when she discovers someone who may have been on the hill with the children - she suspects molestation - she and Felix take matters into their own hands to resolve the issue.

Something's sure amiss with Adolfo and Sara, but each step down the winding rabbit hole leads further into utter madness. It's probably more serious than even molestation. Here Comes the Devil is just straight up frightening.\nPS: I've seen this film compared favorably with Peter Weir's 1975 classic Picnic at Hanging Rock, and I have to agree."}

Tense and at times terrifying, Panic in the Streets is electric gold as far as the genre is concerned. It's tightly written, although viewed through the glass of 2013 a little simplistic at times (see below), and expertly acted.\nIt all starts when a man is smuggled onto a boat that docks in New Orleans. The man then visits a poker game with his cousin and winds up winning a lot of money from a gangster named Blackie (Jack Palance, in his debut). When the man, rather than risk his winnings to give Blackie a chance to win them back, takes off, he's cornered by Blackie and his henchmen, then shot to death and dragged into the river, where he's discovered the next morning.\nBut when the coroner examines the body, he finds something suspicious. Yes, a bullet ended the man's life, but he was already dying. Enter Health Inspector Clint Reed (Richard Widmark), who immediately recognizes the disease as pneumonic plague, which \u2013 and I don't know this to be scientific fact \u2013 is extremely contagious. Reed must find the man's cousin, the Patient Zero, before he can unwittingly pass the illness \u2013 which is fatal \u2013 along to the rest of the city, even the world.\nHe's teamed up with crusty police chief Tom Warren (Paul Douglas), who's not sure the doctor's right but is smart enough to follow orders anyway, however reluctantly. It doesn't take long for him to be convinced that there is cause for panic and that the city as a whole must be quietly quarantined, if plausible.\nThe chemistry between Douglas and Widmark drives the script. Palance is a terrific menace, as he would go on to be in countless movies. Zero Mostel is on hand as one of his henchmen; Barbara Bel Geddes plays Reed's wife. The men are in a race against time, figuring they have less than 48 hours to find their Patient Zero. Warren's police work and Douglas' medical knowledge help them retrace the smuggled man's footsteps and those of the newly infected as well.\nIf I'm going to gripe about anything, it's the ease with which Reed eradicates the disease. What's that, you say? You may have encountered the sick man? Here, we'll inoculate you, all better. Not sure that's how inoculation works, really, but I'll suspend disbelief for this movie on the grounds that it was a lot of fun to watch."}

In 1946, producer David O. Selznick had the on-paper great idea to make a quasi-sequel to his big hit Gone with the Wind, another sprawling Western with intrigue, love, and gorgeous vistas and women. So he set out to make what would become Duel in the Sun, about an orphaned \"half-breed\" (the film's words), who is left in the care of her father's long-ago love on a giant cattle ranch in Texas in the 1800s. She's immediately drawn to each of the sons of the cattle baron who rules the land (Lionel Barrymore) \u2013 the intelligent, kind Jesse (Joseph Cotten) and his brawling, sneering brother Lewt (Gregory Peck). Danger surely will follow.\nIt was a movie that effectively ended Selznick's career as a producer, as the unheard-of budget of $2 million ballooned to $8 million, and even though there were Oscar nominations, the movie didn't fare too well at the box office, with most of the gross coming from rentals later in the century. Selznick was a known micromanager, going through as many as seven (!) directors for the film, including himself, before King Vidor stepped in and somehow made it work. Sort of.\nAside from the main plot of poor Pearl Chavez (Jennifer Jones, who later married Selznick, no coincidence there) and her loves and her (naturally) Spanish passion, there is a subplot about how the US government is trying to build its railroad across the country, but Senator McCanles (Barrymore) will be doggoned if he'll let them there Yankees run through his huge, huge, huge holdings.\nOne look at the posters and other artwork for this movie and you'd think you were in for a romance film, something based on a Harlequin book. Jones on her back, hand raised to protect herself both from the glare of the sun and the actions of the man before her, Peck. And maybe you'd think that with such a great cast (including Lillian Gish, Herbert Marshall, Walter Huston, and Butterfly McQueen) and such a beautiful setting, it might be worthwhile. After all, \"duel\" is right there in the title, so surely there's action. Oh, boy.\nThere's hardly any. Almost every scene in which Jones appears ends with her storming off or crying out in desperation, hand held to forehead. Her character isn't shown as a strong role model, she's shown as fiesty, which is code for \"not knowing her place as a plaything\"; Pearl is played with by Lewt, for the most part, so naturally she's fond of him. Aren't most women in favor of the bad boy? Ahead of its time, Duel in the Sun talks quite a bit about sex without really mentioning it.\nAside from the morally debatable issues with Pearl's character as a woman, there's the relentless racism. Every pejorative you can think of for Native American is tossed out there and then laughed off. That's in addition to the stereotyping of Mexicans as people who just can't control their temper. It doesn't take long for it to get old and a little sickening. Pearl's not permitted to be her own person, just one who's owned.\nTo top it off, this almost could have worked were it not for Jones' performance (although Oscar nominated). She vamps it up in the campiest way possible; perhaps she thought she was doing a soap-opera stint. Her acting is laughable nearly the entire way through. Cotten makes a terrific good guy, and Peck is commanding as the amoral, takes-what-he-wants Lewt. Lionel Barrymore, of course, plays the senator just like he would play mean Mr. Potter in It's a Wonderful Life, which is to say much like he played many of his one-dimensional characters. Gish is a sweet delight as always.\nOh, and the duel? Yes, it happens, and yes it happens in the sun \u2013 on the side of a mountain, no less, but perhaps not between the two people you'd expect. Still, every moment of the so-called duel is excruciating to watch; you want them to hurry up and get on with it already. How long can high noon last? Rhetorical question.\nDuel in the Sun is a dated movie that's way too long, sells it characters short, stars a miscast heroine, and never tugs at any heartstrings like it wishes it could. Understandably, it was nicknamed Lust in the Dust during production, prompting a parody movie decades later. I don't know if moviegoers in 1946 thought they were watching something cutting edge, but this is one dated relic."}

That may sound innocent enough, but of course the grown man finds himself falling for the grown woman whom he believes is 12 years old. In hindsight, that's a little creepy.\nBut here, it's not.

Custer's portrayed as an excellent horseman and swordsman but also the very worst cadet to come out of West Point, a man who somehow fails upward in his Army career. He has his very own archenemy in the person of Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy), who tries to stymie Custer at every turn. The brass doesn't like him, but when war breaks out, off to Washington he goes.\nFunny thing about that war \u2013 aka The War Between the States, or the War against Yankee Aggression \u2013 there's an interesting scene at West Point where the announcement of war has been made to the cadets and officers. Then those present who oppose the Union are actually given the choice to withdraw. Now, I don't profess to be an expert in the war, but\u0085if those officers and soldiers are specifically saying they're willing to take up arms against the government, why wouldn't they be arrested on the spot? The Army sure was lenient back then.\nCuster blusters (ha!) his way into a meeting and friendship with General Winfield Scott (Sydney Greenstreet), who gets the young lieutenant his own regiment. Custer then distinguishes himself in battle by essentially charging into a fray rather than retreating. This somehow works, thus making everyone feel better about promoting him.\nNow, this being a big-budget movie, there is of course a love interest for Custer, in the person of Elizabeth Bacon, played by Olivia de Havilland. Elizabeth is in the movie essentially to help move the plot along (Custer stands her up when he has to rush off to Washington as ordered, but rest easy, they reconcile quickly). Her father (Gene Lockhart) serves as a snooty foil, at least until Custer makes general. But hey, Flynn and de Havilland have their trademark terrific chemistry, and this was their final film together, so that works.\nThe battle scenes are well staged and exciting to watch, even as we know their outcome. Despite all of the goofs \u2013 factual and otherwise \u2013 that plague this film, it's still an enjoyable Flynn vehicle, and he's very good in it."}

It's a psychological thriller set in a prison camp for court-martialed British soldiers, a rugged, terrifying camp run by a ruthless sergeant-major, played by Harry Andrews.\nConnery is Joe Roberts, in the klink for slugging a superior officer after refusing to (re)enter the field of battle (his squad was hopelessly outnumbered and outflanked; see also Paths of Glory). Roberts is tossed in a cell with fellow cons George Stevens (Alfred Lynch), Jacko King (Ossie Davis), Monty Bartlett (Roy Kinnear), and Jock McGrath (Jack Watson), who alternately resent and respect Roberts' actions.\nThe hill of the title is a steep, sandy incline in the middle of the Sahara, where the camp's located. Convicts are tasked with double-timing it up one side and down the other, carrying a loaded backpack and their kit, or duffel bag. And then back again. The hill is used as a way for RSM Wilson (Andrews) to break them, to make them into real soldiers again.\nTrouble arises when Wilson's second in command, Staff Sergeant Williams (Ian Hendry) badgers one of the convicts so relentlessly that the man dies, thus kicking the battle of wits between prisoner and gatekeeper to an entirely new level. And this is where we really begin to see the unvarnished war of man versus man, as Wilson and Williams strain to break not only Roberts but also his cellmates.\nConnery is really fantastic as the strong-willed Roberts, and Wilson \u2013 who played plenty of authoritarian, stiff-backed British characters, is his equal. It's good to see Connery in a movie that transcends his sex appeal and his association with a certain superspy. Filmed in stark black and white (as black and white tends to be), The Hill is near the apex of psychological war films."}

It's about an invisible menace terrorizing a military base and surrounding town in Canada, and it stars Marshall Thompson, late of First Man into Space.\nThompson plays Major Cummings, who's in charge of a nuclear-powered program run at the base, a program intended to enhance surveillance techniques and allow the U.S. to spy on the Soviets at a greater range. The trouble is that even when maximum nuclear power is exerted, the images returned by the spy plane soon fades.\nAt the same time, the locals are a mite anxious about having a nuclear program nearby (some things never change). The constant takeoffs and landings of the various aircraft scares the cows, annoys farmers, and so on. And then a bunch of cows winds up dead, and no one can figure out why. The carnage is only beginning, though \u2013 soon prominent citizens and soldiers alike are meeting their demise, with their brains apparently \u2013 I am not making this up \u2013 sucked out of their skulls through two holes in the back of the head.\nOh, and there's a love interest. There has to be. How could our hero save the day if there were no love interest? Here she's played by Kim Parker, for whom movie this was undoubtedly a career highlight.\nSo this is a low-budget, 1950s monster movie. Except you can't see the monsters, hence the \"without a face\" part. They're like Predator, if Predator was merely a brain and a spinal cord and kind of shuffled on the ground like an inch worm. Still, when these monsters are invisible, they're effectively scary, which is a nice respite from the low-budget effects."}

Stay for the post-credits!", "content": "Yes! 22 Jump Street is even better than the original movie. Or the TV show, for that matter. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have terrific chemistry, perhaps the best in comic cop movies since some guys named Gibson and Glover (over and over) were roaming the streets of LA. The laughs come fast and furious and are generally not of a PG nature, although apparently that was of no concern to the family of four behind me in the theater.\nOfficers Jenko (Tatum) and Schmidt (Hill) are now enrolled in college, trying to nail down the source of a new designer drug (again) that's overtaking the campus. They remain in their high-school guises from the first film, mismatched brothers. Their handler, Captain Dickson (Ice Cube), is sort of glad to see the boys again, since their previous success resulted in a huge budget increase. Which he exploits to the hilt. (I wonder if he ever did get that shark tank.)\nAnyway, Jenko and Schmidt try to find out where the new drug WHYPHY (\"Work hard - why? Play hard - why?) is coming from. Their only lead is a photo of one student buying it from another, with one of the students later winding up dead. Jenko pals around with the jocks, which include possible suspects Zook (Wyatt Russell, Kurt's son) and Rooster (Jimmy Tatro), while Schmidt falls into the boho scene, meeting cute with Maya (Amber Stevens), to whom he develops a kind of liking.\nFor those of us who thought that the title sounded pretty lame, well, it's better than \"21 Jump Street 2,\" right? And of course, this film being as self-aware as a film can be, there's a reason - Jump Street HQ is now located across the street from the old place, since the Koreans wanted their church back. Makes sense.\nMuch of the plot does indeed follow that of the first film, but as Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) tells them, the boys should handle this case the same way they handled the high-school one. It's what the brass wants! But the taking-down-the-bad-guys plot is only window dressing for the real problem, the conflict between the partners as they discover that they've become more different than they were in \"high school.\" Is it possible that they'll need to go their separate ways in order to finish this case? Will this be the last case? Well, no, that's not likely. But the first one is possible. Remember, in 21 Jump Street, somehow Schmidt was the cool guy and Jenko was the schlub who had to hang out with the AV guys (who, naturally saved the day). This time, not so much - Jenko is a BMOC, what with the being strong and apparently immune to alcohol and such. Schmidt is now the one with some doubts about their partnership, and that's the real story behind the story. He can't follow in Jenko's path, or even walk alongside him, because people like the jocks don't want him around. And suddenly Jenko sees his partner as a hindrance, someone preventing him from his true calling - football player. \nMuch mirth is made of the similarities between the duo's partnership and a full-blown emotional relationship. At one point they even visit a psych professor (well, it's to get info about a patient who had taken WHYPHY, but still) and wind up revealing more of their feelings than they may have intended.\nIt's hard to imagine better casting for the roles of Jenko and Schmidt. Tatum and Hill appear to have been working together for decades, honing an act to impeccable heights, so good is their banter. But the fun doesn't stop with them - Ice Cube is a terror as a father and a cop, Rob Riggle and Dave Franco happily reprise their roles from 21 Jump Street (the movie), there's another cameo of a veteran of the \"old\" TV show, and both Amber Stevens and Jillian Bell (playing Maya's roommate) are killer good. Also on hand is the usually oily Peter Stormare as, surprise, the bad guy.\nFor whatever reason, I'm much more inclined to laugh out loud at a movie while at home than when I'm at the theater, but I couldn't stop laughing (or giggling, possibly when Jenko and Schmidt inadvertently take some of the designer drug). The movie was that funny. 22 Jump Street is definitely as good as the first, and for my money it's a step up."}

It's framed as a fantasy, but it is leavened with dollops of honesty, education, and wonder.\nJim (Joel Edgerton) and Cindy (Jennifer Garner) Green have been trying, trying, trying to have a baby. Their fertility doctor informs them that despite all of their efforts, the couple simply cannot conceive. Devastated, Cindy wants them to accept the facts and just move on, but Jim cannot let go. His coping mechanism is for each of them to write some attribute that they believe their child would have had (based on themselves) on pieces of notepaper, put the papers into a wooden box, and bury the box in the backyard garden. This they do, and during a highly unusual thunderstorm that night, they discover an unusual young boy in their house, muddy and wet - and with leaves on his lower legs.\nHis name is Timothy, and he calls Jim and Cindy \"Mom\" and \"Dad.\" At first, Jim and Cindy believe young Timothy to be a runaway - but the leaves on his legs and the big hole in their garden lead them to suspect otherwise. And so, after so much time spent anxiously wishing for a baby of their own, the couple is now thrust full speed into the realm of parenthood. And I do mean full speed, for the very next morning various family members arrive for an outdoor party that apparently our two adults have forgotten all about.\nThrough Timothy, we meet the gang. Jim's dad Big Jim (David Morse) is the sort of smug, arrogant guy that most people take an instant dislike to; conversely, Cindy's Aunt Mel (Lois Smith) and Uncle Bub (M. Emmet Walsh) are the very picture of a lovely older couple. Then there's Cindy's sister Brenda (Rosemarie DeWitt) and her husband Franklin (Ron Livingston), who happens to be Jim's boss at the local pencil-manufacturing plant. Brenda and Franklin famously natter on about their overachieving three-kid brood, something that consistently rankles Cindy.\nTimothy's effect on everyone around him is noticeable. Much like Pollyanna, the glad girl, Timothy seems to make everyone happy, even the cranky sorts like Big Jim. But yes, he is a bit of an oddity, and poor Jim and Cindy are torn between raising a so-called normal child and allowing Timothy to be himself. That does sound treacly, like an Afterschool Special. But somehow, it's not. We don't know where Timothy came from. We don't know why he has leaves on his legs and what they may signify. Those things aren't important to this story, because this is really a tale about not having all of the answers and doing the best anyway. In other words, it's about making mistakes and learning from them.\nThe movie also provides such a great perspective on being a parent (and I say this as a non-parent); Jim and Cindy are bewildered, beset by the ghosts of parents past and present. They try too hard, as one might expect from new parents. Never is this more evident than when Timothy finds himself on the school's soccer team (coached by rapper Common). Yes, they become soccer parents. And Timothy is not some savior who magically makes everything come out just grand. He knows who or what he is, but he is not infallible. In fact, there are many, many things he doesn't know (for example, how to swim).\nI really appreciated the ending. Yes, it's sad and bittersweet, but it's so packed with emotion that the effect is very powerful indeed. Garner and Dianne Wiest, who plays Cindy's boss, are both excellent, and young CJ Adams (seen in the most recent Godzilla adaptation) is stunning."}

Zach Galifianakis and Will Ferrell star as Cam Brady and Marty Huggins, respectively, one vying for an uncontested fifth term and the other a tourism director. Jay Roach, who directed the Austin Powers movies, is at the helm here.\nCam Brady is a slick ladies' man, but when he accidentally leaves a (shall we say) ribald message on the answering machine of a devout family, his backers the Motch brothers think it's time some new blood was sent to Washington (on their behalf). Enter Marty Huggins, who displays none of the alpha-male characteristics one might expect from a politico, as his dad Raymond (Brian Cox) is an old hand at politics and a friend of the Motch brothers. Marty enters the race mainly to impress his jaded dad, who's always favored his other son Clay over Marty.\nMarty's quickly in over his head, but help arrives in the name of Tim Wattley (Dylan McDermott), who's sent by the Motches to be Marty's campaign manager. Wattley soon has rearranged Marty's life (new dogs, new furniture, new wall hangings, new haircut for his wife) and has instilled confidence and even some ferocity into Marty's normally placid personality. This helps Marty in the first candidates' debate.\nThe Motch boys (Dan Aykroyd and John Lithgow) are patterned directly after the Koch brothers, real-life political cronies, with the same business-first mentality. The brothers' aim is to place someone in Congress who they can get favors from, such as tax breaks and other incentives for their various factories.\nThis is not a shrinking-violet movie. Whole lot of profanity, a lot of it funny and some of it even in good taste. The story may seem a little mean spirited to some - the trailer famously showed Ferrell's character punching a baby, sort of a no-no in politics - and truthfully there are times when the nastiness is a little over the top. Galifianakis and Ferrell are good enough to pull it off, but they can't work miracles. That said, there are some really funny scenes, including the debates, the fake commercials (which escalate in hostility), and really any interaction between the stars.\nBut the movie is also often too maudlin and melodramatic; too much that could have been funny or at least sweetly sincere is instead blown up, stretching our credulity even further. One thing about this movie certainly does ring true, and that is that Big Money can win a campaign."}

Escape from Tomorrow, filmed guerrilla style at the actual Disney resort in Florida, is part marital melodrama, part horror show, and part surreal oddity. The movie is as tough to explain as it is to be disregarded.\nRoy Abramsohn plays Jim, father of two, who learns that his boss is laying him off. Jim hides this information from his wife Emily (Elena Schuber), his son Elliot, and his daughter Sara. There's already tension afoot between Jim and Emily, possibly a by-product of a busy vacation with two kids. Jim begins to have macabre visions while the family visits the attractions, and he and Elliot split from mother and daughter to ride on Buzz Lightyear at Elliot's behest - but, unfortunately, the ride shuts down, after a long wait, owing to a technical malfunction. Trying to make the disappointment up to Elliot, Jim takes him on Space Mountain, a scary ride by Disney standards, and Elliot gets sick. This leads to more tension (and a fight) with Emily.\nAll the while, Jim notices a couple of French teens who occasionally look at him and giggle. Becoming more and more obsessed with the girls, he drags one kid or another around the park to follow the teens around. But the Happiest Place on Earth is slowly becoming more and more sinister to Jim, as he encounters the (fictional, probably) seedy underbelly of the park, including costumed princesses who make money on the side, ex-princesses who are more than what they seem, and even secrets beneath EPCOT Center.\nWhat's going on? Is Jim imagining things? It'd be easy to suppose that, but there are too many weird things that he encounters that his kids also see, so the audience is left to presume that these experiences are real. On the one hand, we have the understandable friction between husband and wife near the end of a stressful vacation, but on the other we have some horrific tragedies that seem almost out of context, intentionally juxtaposed with a veneer of joy and gladness. Who are the teens, anyway? Who are these Disney princesses? Forget about tugging on Superman's cape; this is like watching Mickey in a knife fight with Grumpy.\nDirector Randy Moore took care to deemphasize the Disney brand, although he left \"Spaceship Earth\" and \"Space Mountain\" intact, and various costume critters abound. The \"It's a Small World\" ride is transformed into something else, probably because Moore sure wasn't going to pay for the rights to use the song. And, unlike most of the rides, it has a prominent role. But for the most part, the movie was filmed furtively, on hand-held cameras and with scripts stored on iPhones an the like. The choice to shoot in black and white, too, lends a whiff of realism to the proceedings.\nI like the premise, this madness set against a prototypical, nuclear, all-American family, but the execution doesn't always work. Jim is thrown into situations that at first do seem compelling but ultimately don't seem to propel the plot much - other than to confuse and confound the audience, anyway. Escape from Tomorrow thus feels like a missed opportunity (although with a great open-ended conclusion), with a story that lacks both cohesion and context; Jim's descent into madness is somewhat undercut by the aimlessness of the plot. Although we can empathize with some of Jim's issues (new unemployment, a witch of a wife, bratty kids, and other stress forms), the bizarre environment that makes up the bulk of the movie forces too much distance between the characters and the audience."}

And when the oh-so-American version came out in 1998, I saw that one as almost a comedy, and not in a good way. But this one? This new version of the oft-told tale is downright terrifying, combining a plausible origin with sterling special effects and not one but three really big monsters.\nOur story begins in the Phillippines in 1999. Scientists are called to a mine in which a huge skeleton has been unearthed; within this skeleton are two pods - one broken open, with a trail leading to the sea. Not long after, unusual seismic activity is recorded at the Janjira nuclear power plant in Japan. The plant's operator, Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) sends his wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche) and her team down into the core to check the sensors. But then there's this big explosion, and Sandra and the other scientists in the core are trapped. Publicly, the disaster, which affects all of Japan, is attributed to a 6.3-magnitude earthquake.\nSome 15 years later, the Brodys' son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is a Navy bomb-disposer guy, to use the technical term, and he's a bit estranged from his dad, who's become obsessed with finding out the true reason for the so-called earthquake. Shortly after Ford returns home to San Francisco to be with his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) and son Sam, he learns that Papa Joe has been arrested in Japan for trespassing on the grounds of the old, now-quarantined plant. Joe insists that there was no earthquake, that an electromagnetic pulse was behind the disaster. And he may be right, because while Ford is in Japan collecting his dad, there's another incident, and a gigantic winged creature flees the scene. No, it's not Godzilla, but he's around somewhere.\nFret not; Gozdilla does show up, and when he does it's a real heart stopper. He's not King Kong tall, he's more like ten or eleven King Kongs tall. He's Kanye's ego tall. He's Donald Sterling's racism tall. He's a big fella, is what I'm getting at here. Anyway, he and Winged Monster (called a MUTO, for Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) are soon joined by another creepy dude, who's like Winged Monster although without wings. They both sort of look like the monster from Cloverfield, come to think of it, but much more realistic.\nWould it be spoiling things if I noted that all three beat the heck out of each other? Probably not. It's also not a spoiler to note that the armed forces attempt to use everything from handguns to tank ordnance on our friendly neighborhood monsters, to little avail. Nuclear weapons are mentioned. \nThis is such a visceral movie. There's little in the way of shaky-cam cinematography, and you almost never get a full-on look at any of the monsters. This is good, because it highlights how damn huge these guys are; if you or I were there, we wouldn't be able to fully comprehend their colossal stature without moving back, oh, a couple hundred miles. All of this makes the movie feel very much real and as if you're very much in the middle of things, 3D or not. The CGI is worlds better than it was for Roland Emmerich's 1998 dud.\nThere are plenty of jaw-dropping moments of terror, and there are a multitude of on-screen deaths, PG-13 rating or not. There's always this lingering feeling of being trapped. After all, you can't go into the water (Godzilla swims!), and you can't go into the city (Godzilla smash!), and you can't even go into the mountains, because these guys are tall, tall, tall. How tall? Grande from Starbucks tall. So you're trapped, and you can't figure out how to stop them, since bullets don't work. \nTurns out it's not complicated, but I'll let you see for yourself on that score. Anyway, although I watched the 3D version of this, I don't think the 3D added much to the experience. It didn't take away from it (that is, it wasn't distracting), but it did seem needless in retrospect. \nBut the bottom line for me is that Godzilla is a lot less campy and much, much scarier than the version from olden times (1954). Think World War Z without zombies or the ability to zip around from continent to continent. Okay, so technically here we move between North America and Asia, but you get the idea."}

It is a rare film that manages paradoxically to be beautiful and fearful, sincere but not maudlin.\nThe world is ending. A huge asteroid is hurtling through space on a course with Earth in three weeks' time, and a Space Shuttle mission to destroy it has just failed. As the film begins, the news of that failure is announced on the news. Dodge (Carell), a mild-mannered insurance salesman, and his wife Linda (Nancy Carell, Steve's real-life wife) hear the news while sitting in a car. As Dodge sighs despondently, Linda suddenly opens the door and bolts, and that's the last we see of her.\nAll around Dodge, people react differently to their impending demise. There are suddenly more available parking spaces at his office. Traffic is even more riotous and aggrieving. His friends Diane (Connie Britton) and Warren (Rob Corddry) throw a no-rules party, complete with heroin, little kids drinking booze, and no attachments. Diane's attempting to set Dodge up with her friend Karen (Melanie Lynskey), but Dodge simply isn't interested - not in the hedonism, not in anything.\nAnd then one day, Dodge finds a woman outside his window, on the fire escape. She's Penny (Knightley), his upstairs neighbor, and she's hanging out while her boyfriend clears his stuff out of the apartment. She enters the apartment, and she and Dodge strike up a conversation; shortly thereafter, Penny is fast asleep (she's described herself as a hypersomniac).\nThis is not some quirky meet-cute movie. Dodge's poker face belies a real sense of grief - his wife, his absent family, his lack of friends. But then, while sifting through mail that had accidentally been sent to Penny's apartment, Dodge finds a letter from his high school sweetheart (whom he'd never really gotten over) indicating her desire to reconnect with him. This changes everything. This gives the man a reason to live, at least for three more weeks. And when violence breaks out in the city, he - and Penny - make a run for it, heading for the sweetheart's parents' house (no return address on the letter's envelope).\nThis is also not some mismatched travel-companions movie. Both Penny and Dodge are vulnerable, humanistic, and alive with passions of self-doubt and honesty. And while they are on their quest and get to know each other, the signs of the impending apocalypse are never far away. There is no misapprehension about the chances of survival. Humanity will cease to be, in a short time. It's important for Dodge to get the closure he wants, and it is important for Penny to find a way back to her family, in England (the movie is set in the Northeast US).\nCarell gives an atypically tender performance that I think may have been overlooked by critics and audiences alike. Dodge is not a hero, grimly determined to beat the odds, but he is also not some spineless pushover. He's simply a genuine character brought to multifaceted life by a tremendously gifted actor. Knightley, too, is a real treat as the well-meaning Penny, trying to do her best by Dodge in his quest to find his beloved. Both performances are powerful. And although the approaching asteroid is kept in the metaphorical background, its existence permeates almost every scene, lending a strong air of terror.\nBut far and away, this is much less a sci-fi movie than a movie about opening hearts, breaking down emotional walls, and being happy. Director Lorene Scafaria easily trumps her earlier films, Whip It and Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist with a moving, emotionally packed film."}

And here's the kicker - you don't need to have seen the previous movies in the series to understand what's going on. There's an unerring blend of past and present characters, real heart-in-your-throat tension, and stunning effects. Yeah, so I sort of liked it a little bit.\nI don't mean to fawn, but sometimes it's appropriate. This is a great movie. In a nutshell, here's your story. It's sometime in the future (2029? not sure). The Sentinels, robots built with the sole purpose of eradicating all mutants, are on the rampage, tracking said mutants down and slaughtering them, full stop. In fact, they've become so advanced that when a mutant defends against/attacks a Sentinel, that mutant's powers are absorbed by that Sentinel. Get it? It's a bad scene. \nProfessor Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Magneto (Ian McKellan), Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), and other assorted X people have holed up in the middle of nowhere, awaiting their doom. Xavier believes that the only way to stop the war on mutants (and on sympathetic humans, by the way, in case you missed the analogy) is to travel back in time to prevent the creation of the Sentinels in 1973. Now, Professor X wants to be sent back (don't worry, Kitty Pryde is on the job), but because of the long time period between '73 and the present, Pryde thinks the journey would snap even the Professor's mind. Instead, they opt to send Wolverine back, because he's essentially unchanged from 1973 (more-or- less ageless, really) and would therefore adjust better to the trip. And so back he goes.\nA solo, rogue mission by Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), in an effort to destroy Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), the creator of the Sentinels, merely gave the public and the government cause to turn on the mutants, thus sparking the war. So: Wolverine is to locate Mystique and persuade her to give up her cause, and he won't be able to do so without the help of...the younger Professor X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender). Aye, there's the rub, huh? Older, wiser Magneto regrets fighting Charles Xavier all those years, but younger, angrier Magneto isn't so shrewd. (They're just like people!)\nSo there's your setup. Young Magneto is being held secretly about 100 stories below the Pentagon in a super-ultra-mega-maximum security cell for the murder of...well, never mind. Young Xavier, on the other hand, is hiding out at his School for Gifted Youngsters, which no longer is a school nor houses youngsters, except for Beast, who helps his mentor faithfully. Thus the movie unites not only good mutants and bad mutants but younger and older versions of themselves, more or less. And because of the trippy time shenanigans, you could possibly see familiar mutants, from movies other than the First Class one. Sounds like this would make for a crowded cast, but the action centers around the younger Magneto and Xavier, Mystique, Wolverine, and the younger Beast (Nicholas Hoult). \nIt feels so good to have Bryan Singer back behind the wheel. The story flows in sync with the dazzling, but not distracting, effects, as if a steady-handed auteur was in charge. This feels like the most authentic and personal X-Men film to date, and I (yeah, yeah) liked each of the others. And heaven forfend if I bust out a spoiler, but you know what they say about time-travel movies: they can change things, man."}

There are a couple of shock moments - not shocking, just shock - but for the most part the plot is weak, overly murky, and aimless.\nThis is much more of a comedy than a scary movie, if the screening audience was any indication. Boy, you never heard such laughter. True, there was some gasps from time to time, but truth be told, those scenes were predicated on the audience's not knowing that something might happen when a camera pans slowly around a room or focuses tightly on our heroine's face. \nFor the story, it seems that 11 years ago something dreadful happened in the Russell family. Our first encounter is with the grown Tim (Brenton Thwaites), who's being released from a mental hospital. Seems that Tim was blamed for whatever happened so long ago and has been institutionalized ever since. He's met outside the hospital by his older sister, Kaylie (Karen Gillan). Kaylie wants to help her brother adjust to life on the outside, but first she has a favor to ask, and it involves helping her (or them) overcome their demons once and for all.\nThe movie jumps back and forth in time, sometimes a little too seamlessly. As things unfold, we're able to piece together what happen - or at least how Kaylie and Tim remember it. It all has to do with an old, old mirror that their father had purchased for their new home. In the present, Kaylie has gone to the trouble of finding a buyer for it at auction and then offers to fix a crack in the mirror (this makes sense in the movie). Instead, she hauls it to the old family house, where she plans to prove - to herself, to the world - that the mirror is evil and that it's to blame for the deaths of Tim and Kaylie's parents.\nKaylie, to my mind, seems unhinged right from the start. She pays cursory attention to Tim's adjustment period, focusing on the mirror instead. She sets up an elaborate system involving the use of multiple cameras, the presentation of historical evidence of the mirror's effect on (some of) its previous owners, the monitoring of the temperature in the house, the health of the plants in the house, and so on. She also employs several egg timers to indicate when she needs to hydrate and eat, when she needs to change the videotapes, and when she needs to reset the kill switch. The kill switch here is a large descending weight that launches a swinging blade directly at the mirror. So Kaylie's put some thought into this, is what I'm getting at.\nBut the movie spends far too much time trying to persuade the audience that Kaylie's right, rather than just presenting her evidence and then moving on. The movie's practically a third over by the time scary stuff really starts to happen. And because there's so much flitting between time frames (often in the same scene), with perception itself becoming more and more muddled, that it's at times tough to discern if what appears to be happening to the characters is actually happening. There were far too many times when I just wasn't sure if the whole mess was all in Kaylie's head, and that kind of uncertainty made the movie hard to enjoy on that level.\nI would have liked if the slow pace near the beginning moved quickly into creative, fast-paced horror action; instead, there was a lot of talking (mostly between Kaylie and a disbelieving Tim) punctuated by intermittent pieces of propelled plot. On the more positive note, both Gillan and Thwaites are good, as is Rory Cochrane as their father.\nThe denouement kind of fizzles. It's the kind that's supposed to come out of nowhere and startle you something fierce, but all I felt was sweet relief that the end was nigh. The ending just feels like a cheat, or maybe a cheap toupee slapped over a shaved weasel with digestive problems. And although that may not be a particularly coherent analogy, it still seems quite appropriate for this movie."}

The year may be young, but Wes Anderson's film is one of my favorites so far. \nA young writer (Jude Law), staying at the titular hotel, chances to encounter the establishment's elderly owner, Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), who relates the tale of how he came to own the place \"between the wars\" in the mythical eastern European country of Zubrowka. \nZero began his career as a lobby boy in the hotel, under the mentorship of the hotel's legendary concierge, M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). Gustave knows his eccentric, rich guests very well, particularly the elderly female ones. One such guest is Madame D (Tilda Swinton), with whom Gustave has an occasional fling. She is due to leave the hotel and return home, but she's anxious, feeling that someone is conspiring around her. She fears she won't see Gustave again.\nWell, it's not long before Madame D turns up dead, and Gustave (with Zero) rushes to her wake, only to find himself at the reading of the will. It will surprise few people that the only item of value in Madame D's large estate has been bequeathed to Gustave - a painting called Boy with Apple. But the inheritance is quickly challenged by the deceased's son Dmitri (Adrien Brody), who's a plain mean and profane jerk. And then, as the trailer indicates, Gustave and the loyal Zero abscond with the painting anyway and hide it; Gustave is arrested and jailed. \nThe movie is brimming with spot-on performances. Bill Murray, Fisher Stevens, and Bob Balaban have small roles as fellow concierges. Jason Schwartzmann is a present-day lobby boy. Owen Wilson is Gustave's immediate replacement as concierge. Harvey Keitel is a tough inmate. Willem Dafoe is a ruthless hit-man in Dmitri's employ. Most have worked in Wes Anderson films before, and all work very well together.\nI've seen a few Wes Anderson movies, and I think this one most closely resembles Moonrise Kingdom in terms of its whimsical tone. In fact, it may even bear some relation to the Coen Brothers masterpieces O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Raising Arizona - black comedies whose success depends so much on their actors' ability to really sell deadpan humor in an otherwise-serious context. Fiennes, who's not known for his comedies, is superb as the gentlemanly Gustave, and he drives the movie with equal parts British reservedness and explosive irritation - but always with the utmost in manners. The movie is also beautifully shot, but frequent Anderson collaborator Robert D. Yeoman. From the stylish structure of the hotel to the stark desolation of the Alps, the film has a delightfully distinct look to it, par for the course for Anderson films."}

Well, with that mystery solved, I settled in to watch what has become a rather typical comic-book movie: intelligent, evocative, thrilling, and entertaining.\nHere's your quick-and-dirty summary to set the scene; comic-book nerds out there, please correct me if I'm wrong, because that'll prove someone's reading this other than me. The movie takes place after the events in The Avengers. Captain America (Chris Evans) is trying to assimilate into the present day, and he leads an elite forces team. In the opening scenes, his team, aided by Black Widow (Scarlet Johanson), infiltrate a SHIELD boat that's been commandeered by terrorists who have a beef with SHIELD. Cap and the Gang roust out the bad guys, but Cap is somewhat surprised to see Black Widow grabbing info from hard drives. He's soon briefed by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) that SHIELD is involved in a huge defense program called Project Insight: three enormous helicarriers that are linked to spy satellites, the better to knock out threats before they happen. Shades of Minority Report.\nFury has joined forces with the World Security Council and its leader, Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) for this enterprise, and true to comic trope, there's soon skulduggery afoot. It's not hard to see who's treacherous and who's not, but that's part of the fun of these movies, anyway. As a result of the cloak-and-dagger atmosphere, Captain America and Black Widow, along with new superhero Falcon (Anthony Mackie), who sports an exoskeleton with wings and weaponry.\nThe movie forces Steve Rogers, aka Cap, to face parts of his past that he might be better off leaving alone. His girl from back in the 1940s, Peggy Carter, is convalescing in a home for retired people, Steve's apparently last living link to that past. But Steve's straight-arrow, black-and-white moral compass seems oddly out of sync with the gray areas of the present, which makes Black Widow a great match for him. You know, opposites and all of that.\nThis is a movie in which secrets upon secrets are revealed, like layers of an onion and often just as odorous. Anyway, although it's not tough for Cap and Black Widow to determine who the bad guys are, stopping said villains is another problem altogether. This leads to several fantastic action scenes, very well choreographed and a treat to watch - even in 2D, or perhaps especially in 2D.\nI sat, by necessity, in the second row for this movie, which meant that my head was inclined as if I were talking to a giraffe with an overactive pituitary gland. It also meant that I needed to focus harder on the action before me, because at that distance the illusion of the celluloid tale can more easily be broken. This movie captivated me throughout, pardon the pun, and it's a terrific vehicle for both Captain America and Black Widow, not to mention the slippery Nick Fury himself. \nI did wonder, as the plot centers around something that could endanger the entire world, where was the rest of the Avengers squad? Tony Stark is mentioned once (but not Iron Man), and we see a portrait of his father, but that's it for connections to The Hulk, Thor, Hawkeye, and Iron Man. If the world's about to be harmed, you'd think that would rise to the importance level of those guys, right? Okay, that's nitpicking.\nIt's true that the movie's plot is familiar and that many of the characters, being based on comic-book characters themselves, lack real depth. But these problems are minor, because the action scenes - hey, this is a comic-book movie, not some weepy melodrama! - is so exhilarating. Great care has been taken to curate the Marvel Universe in cinematic form, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier is not only a fine standalone picture but also a elegant lead for the next Avengers movie - not to mention future Captain America movies. Watch those end credits!"}

Yes, I know I'm a couple years late. But what a terrific movie. Not a false note in it. It's compelling, original, and full of heart.\nTwo boys, Ellis and Neckbone, go looking for a boat that's found its way to the top of a pine tree on an island in the Mississippi River. They find the boat, all right, but it seems that living in that very boat is a scraggly looking man (Matthew McConaughey) who introduces himself as Mud. Mud is waiting for someone, he tells the boys, his beloved girlfriend Juniper (Reese Witherspoon). The boys agree to help and to tell no one of MUD's residence on the island.\nBut there's more to the story than meets the eye. Yes, Juniper exists, but the relationship that she and Mud have (and have had) is not all peaches and cream. And there are folks out for Mud's blood, pardon the phrasing. Still, the man is persuasive, particularly for a couple of teenagers from the less-affluent side of town. Mud gives the boys something to believe in and a real sense of self worth.\nThe boys don't come from broken homes, though. Ellis (Tye Sheridan) has a mother and father who, unlike stereotypical movies about struggling families, are fairly well grounded. They're good parents who love their only child, even if the love in their marriage has waned somewhat. Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) lives with his Uncle Galen (Michael Shannon), who's anything but an obnoxious, sullen jerk.\nThe chemistry between McConaughey and the two young actors is fantastic. The elder thespian doesn't dominate their scenes, he complements them. This is what you get when Matthew McConaughey drops the aw-shucks act and gets serious. But he's not in every scene, and young Sheridan proves to be more than capable of carrying a movie. Ellis tries, succeeds, fails, but always wants to do the right thing. He helps Mud out of a sense of duty; he feels that since he and Juniper love each other, they deserve to be together. It's a simple worldview, but he is only 14, after all.\nDirector Jeff Nichols, who also made the superb Take Shelter, has a keen sense of when to show action and when to let his talented cast mesmerize their audience. This isn't a character study, but it is an study of the characters of two protagonists: the world-weary fibber Mud and the perceptive, honorable Ellis."}

It does feature fine performances, but the promising premise quickly winds its way through predictable scenarios and foreseeable outcomes. \nJoaquin Phoenix, doing his best Jude Law impression, plays Theodore Twombley, a man who writes \"handwritten\" letters for clients in what's probably the future. He gets the basic idea from the client and then goes to town, dictating his letter to his computer, which renders the letter in nice neat cursive for the recipient. The letters are sincere and heartfelt, and Theodore is very good at his job.\nWhen we first meet Theodore, he's a lonely, mopey guy, still recovering from a separation from his wife (Rooney Mara) a year prior, even though the divorce papers haven't yet been signed. His friends Amy (Amy Adams) and Charles worry about him; Theodore never really goes out. Then he sees an ad for a new operating system for the home, a system with not only a personality but also the ability to grow and learn. \nSince he's looking for some companionship anyway, he purchases the new system and installs it. The system has the voice of Scarlett Johansson and names herself Samantha. Soon, Samantha is best-friends-for-life with Theodore; she helps him to stay organized and focused, plays the role of supportive friend, offers advice and conversation, all things that Theo really needs. But, since she is an operating system designed to evolve, she begins to want more out of existence. She, like Data from Star Trek and countless other not-human characters, wants to know what it's like to be human, to have both a body and feelings.\nThis may seem like an odd relationship (and it is), but it's more normal in this pseudo-future than it is in real life. People left and right have personalized operating systems. You think it's still strange to see someone talking to themselves? You check yourself and realize they're using Bluetooth for something, right? Now imagine most people doing that, only instead of an obvious Bluetooth headset there's only a tiny earpiece. It's a little counterintuitive, in a way: a movie that's all about getting a man to get out and enjoy life more does so by isolating him from the world, just him and his operating system (in portable, iPhone form). Come to think of it, I can't remember seeing Theodore talking on the phone with anyone other than Samantha.\nIt isn't long before Theodore and Samantha realize they have very strong feelings for one another. Again, not really as weird as it would be today, as so many people apparently do date their operating systems in Theo's world. He's soon taking Samantha places, at her behest, and they live and love and play and laugh and so on, just as if it were a humans- only relationship. That they do hit some rough patches points again to Samantha's ability to grow - to become more human, really. But how human can she be? More human than human?\nThis is the first movie that Spike Jonze has both written and directed. That fact may have no bearing on the pacing on the film, but I include it just in case. I thought that the movie moved excruciatingly slow, as it were filmed in a dreamy fog, or a foggy dream, or a nightclub. This is a character study, and a sci-fi one at that, so one would expect deliberate pacing. But in Her, I felt that the story moved even more slowly than that. The camera sometimes lingered for several seconds on a close-up shot of a character, usually Theodore. The setup for scenes (for example, Theo's blind date with Olivia Wilde) takes longer than the scenes themselves, which means a lot of exposition and a lot of talking. \nThat's not a bad thing if your movie has some profound wisdom to share or if the methodical pacing is offset by actual movement and plot development, but neither one of those criteria apply here. We do get strong performances by Phoenix, Adams, and Johannson, but in the end it feels like nothing really happened. Sure, Theo has changed a little, but we're left in the dark as to how much and if his life has truly improved."}

It's brutally forthcoming and neither panders to its audience nor glosses over the evil that men (and women) do. It features an transcendent performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor as the lead, nearly matched by Michael Fassbender, as an exceptionally cruel slaveowner.\nThe story opens in Saratoga Springs, New York. Solomon Northrup (Ejiofor) has just seen his wife and two children off on a trip. While walking across the town square, Solomon meets a couple of men who wish for Solomon to play violin for their circus. He travels with them down to Washington, DC and wines and dines with the gentlemen in celebration of Solomon's contribution to the entertainment. But Solomon becomes ill and is put to bed by the men; in the morning, he finds himself in a slave pen, unable to produce papers that would prove him to be a free man.\nSolomon is acquired by a slave trader named, ironically, Freeman (Paul Giamatti), who in turns sells Solomon and others to a landowner named Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) down in Georgia. Solomon's name is now Platt, and his odyssey proceeds through several owners, some meaner than others, but none quite capable for seeing him as the human being he is. Solomon witnesses many evils, including torture, rape, and murder for even the smallest slights against white people and finds that even to survive he cannot count on any help, inside or out.\nThis is not an easy movie to watch. It's not just about shining a light on of the most morally deplorable times in our nation's brief history; it's about getting inside the head of a trapped man, a man desperate to return to his loving family but beset on all sides by incoherent rage and inhumanity. As Solomon himself puts it, \"I don't want to survive. I want to live.\"\nEjiofor is terrific. When Solomon feels pain, physical or emotional, we feel his pain as well, through Ejiofor's heart-breaking, commanding performance. Solomon's attitude transforms him from a this-must-be-a- mistake nonbeliever trying to convince people he is indeed a legally free man to a defiant, determined, and desperate sojourner. It's a remarkable piece of work by Ejiofor, who had his first break into movies with Steven Spielberg's Amistad - also with slavery as its main theme.\nMcQueen has assembled a profoundly talented cast to back him up. As the worst villain in the lot, Fassbender (as slaveowner Epps) is more than just convincing - you half expect to learn that Fassbender is a true Southern boy rather than being German born - he is also spellbinding as the horrid Epps, a man even nastier than Leonardo DiCaprio's vaunted Calvin Candie from Django Unchained. Candie was a smirking frat boy compared with Edwin Epps, a man who delights in using his slaves for whatever he wishes, punishing them when they don't pick enough in his cotton fields, favoring one as a plaything even over his own wife (Sarah Paulson). \nOne aspect I really liked about this movie was that it never paints any white person as the savior of the black protagonist. Never. How many movies have we seen about slavery and civil rights in which some white person deigns to help the black people and is thus their hero? It's not so here. The closest is Cumberbatch's Ford, but even then the landowner would rather save his skin than form a connection with Solomon (or hear that Solomon is actually a free man). There is no help to be found from kindly white folks here. (Aside - okay, there is, right near the end, but it's apparently true to Solomon's experiences and does not make up for the years of agony that Solomon experienced before running into said white person by chance.) A lesser movie may have tried to shoehorn in a ray of hope for Solomon Northrup in a half-baked attempt to reach a wider audience, but thankfully that didn't happen here. \nThis isn't a popcorn movie, and it's probably not a date movie. It's intellectual and brutish, realistic, believable, painful, and astonishing. It's clearly one of the best of the year and of the careers of McQueen, Ejiofor, and Fassbender."}

It boasts terrific effects and choreography but perhaps a little too much plot, too many new characters, and a lengthy running time.\nThe Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug picks up more or less where the first film left off; the dwarfs, Bilbo Baggins, and Gandalf have left the Misty Mountains and continue their quest to the Lonely Mountain, former dominion of the Dwarf race, aiming to recapture it and the treasure below it from the demonic dragon Smaug. (Interestingly, Smaug himself doesn't even make an appearance on screen until the final half hour of the film.) The outfit is led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), descendant of the last King beneath the Mountain, before Smaug took over; the other dwarfs are more-or-less interchangeable, much like those who accompanied Snow White in her adventures. Their names are, I think, Palin, Marty Balin, Gerald McBoingBoing, Doink, Coin, and Gilligan. I'm not sure.\nNow, the movie's title implies that Smaug (voice of Benedict Cumberbatch) is desolate - he sort of is, living beneath the Lonely Mountain and all - but since this is more about the journey than the destination, we are treated to concurrent plots and unexpected encounters. The troupe loses Gandalf when the latter rushes off to deliver one of his legendary Important Messages, so he's absent for much of the film, and within some time the gang finds itself within the forests of Mirkwood, which is inhabited by Elves who aren't really like the stern-but-nice ones at Rivendell. (You know, from the last film.) \nAnd these Elves are a heck of a lot more suspicious of, well, everything. They're led by Thranduil (Lee Pace), who wishes to keep his realm closed off from the problems of the outside world, much like Elrond would for Rivendell in the later LOTR films. Thranduil's son is Legolas (Orlando Bloom), whom we're well acquainted with; he's smitten with the chief of the wood-elf guards, Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) - but, like Shakespeare's star-cross'd lovers, Papa would never let the sylvan elf be with his offspring. You know how it is.\nBut lest you think this is all about the Elves and Dwarfs and how they dislike/despise each other, there's another fun thread to follow: it looks like a certain Evil is gathering strength, both in body and in numbers, although remaining hidden from view. Thus the Orcs are both tracking Thorin and his merry men and helping their Master - you know who I mean - to become more corporeal. And then, to riff on an old 1970s TV show, there's Smaug. So there's truly no shortage of Bad Guys, and nor is there a shortage of ominous foreshadowing.\nThe movie never drags, and it makes good (judicious) use of 3D, but it suffers from a real lack of personality. Bilbo and Gandalf, who have the most charisma and charm of the bunch, are given less to do here than in the first film; the Dwarvish leader Thorin, by contrast, isn't a sufficiently interesting character to hold extended attention. In addition, you have all of these Dwarfs whose names aren't entirely memorable, so when one is left behind all one can do is shrug and wonder who else is left. \nWhich brings us to the the truly positive aspects of the movie. The fight and action scenes are supremely entertaining to watch, with Elf versus Orc, Elf versus Dwarf, Dwarf versus Orc, Dwarf versus Human, Wizard versus Orc, Wizard versus Something Evil, and Dragon versus Hobbit and Dwarfs. The intensity of each of these scenes is almost poetic, with Lilly and Bloom miles beyond everyone else in their seemingly effortless Orc-slaying abilities. Lilly in particular is remarkable, both beautiful, humanistic, and cunning beyond her years; her Tauriel (oddly enough, not really a Tolkien character) is savvy, level headed, and soft hearted. \nThe final scene, more than two and a half hours into the film, is a bit of a letdown, a mere gateway to the final part of the trilogy. It's true that the first Hobbit film took the same tack, but this time out the denouement feels abrupt; we left not just wanting more but simply hanging."}

It features a humanistic, heartfelt performance by Oscar Isaac as the titular folk singer, arresting cinematography, and a sharp, tight-fisted script by the Coen brothers, who also directed.\nIt's Greenwich Village in the early sixties, when folk music was either coming into its own or ready to be usurped by a more mainstream genre. Llewyn has no home, drifting from gig to gig and crashing on couch after couch as a matter of design; is vagrancy is his life's plan. Llewyn is at turns a noble soul who exists for the sake of making the music he wants to make and a resentful twerp who mooches off friends just to sustain his unsustainable lifestyle.\nThe movie is only somewhat linear, with closing scenes mirroring opening scenes, and it is told entirely from Llewyn's point of view. The Coen brothers masterfully show us not only Llewyn's perspective but also an outside perspective; this allows us to feel both empathy and loathing toward him.\nLlewyn is nothing if not complex. The movie does a terrific job of avoiding the usual clich\u00e9s, such as a down-on-his-luck musician catching a lucky break, or a bitter man having a quick change of heart. It's not that Llewyn is constantly sneering at everyone, holding his poverty up as both a shield and a trophy, it's that he is so multilayered that when he does a kind act or offers some praise or thanks, we don't feel that his doing so is in any way out of character. Llewyn is a self-tortured soul, but unlike caricatures of wandering folkies, he is at his center a realist, albeit a prideful one.\nDuring his travels and travails, Llewyn encounters people ranging from the genuine (his singing friends Jim and Jean, played by Justin Timberlake and Carey Mulligan) to the absurd (a rotund, blustery John Goodman). Oh, and a cat that travels with Llewyn - at least until he can get him or her back to the owner. The encounters with the genuine folks feel just as normal as if you or I encountered them; those with the more absurd of the lot feel perfectly surreal, and when they do end one almost wonders if we've all imagined the encounters through Llewyn himself.\nThe music is beautiful and moving. Isaac himself performs Llewyn's songs, with a sweet, vulnerable voice that offers a touch of soul to Llewyn's otherwise-bleak surroundings. When Llewyn is really on, you can feel his pain leap right off the screen into your brain; when he appears to be going through the motions and not singing from his heart, you can feel the lack of depth that his intended audience also feels. Isaac is just flat-out terrific.\nUltimately, it is Isaac and the music that push this film into the territory of great cinema. The story itself is stark, moody, unyielding - just like a New York City winter, really. And the movie, like Llewyn's own life, appears to have no point - except to illustrate just how pointless Llewyn is making his life, through his stubborn marriage to his craft and a desire to stay uprooted"}

It's exceptionally well cast, but it trods over some well-worn ground and is an almost-relentless portrait of desolation, isolation, and depression. \nChristian Bale plays Russell Baze, an ironworker in the local steel mill. When Russell is sent to prison following a supremely tragic event, his younger brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) is left to his own devices - such as bare-knuckle fighting and betting on ponies - while helping to take care of their invalid, dying dad. \nThe problem is that Rodney finds himself very easily in hock to the local crime lord, John Petty (an epic performance by the underrated Willem Dafoe); Rodney doesn't want to work in the mill, doesn't want to do actual work, does want to fight. But he's not terribly good at throwing the fights, thus placing him even further in debt to Petty.\nShortly after Russell gets out of prison, Rodney disappears. The Pennsylvania cops have an inkling where he might be - he's across the state line, in New Jersey, where the mountain folk don't take kindly to strangers in their midst; they're always a few steps ahead of the law, and folks being close knit and all in the community, the police can never seem to find anyone to cooperate against the white-trash bad boys of the mountain, led by one Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson).\nLike The Fighter before it, Out of the Furnace features two down-on- their-luck brothers, one smart and one sort of shifty, although here Bale switches it up and plays the smart one. It's a movie you've probably seen before. When the police appear to be impotent in finding out what happened to Rodney, Russell takes matters into his own hands to exact his revenge.\nThe performances are worthy of acclaim. Bale and Affleck show excellent chemistry with each other, although Affleck's half-whiny/half-nasally voice grates after a while. Dafoe is nearly flawless, and Zoe Saldana (as Russell's girl), Forest Whitaker (as the local sheriff), and Sam Shepard (as Uncle Red) offer plenty of grit (in Saldana's case, charm) and charisma. \nBut it's sort of an obvious movie. It has an obvious villain, an obvious (anti)hero, and an obvious denouement. The script, by director Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart) and Brad Ingelsby, tosses no curveballs and offers no mystery. In short order, the plot points align, and the only thing for the viewer to do is wait the movie out. Still, Bale's so effective that even the pedestrian story becomes compelling to a certain degree. But it's telling that for a movie called Out of the Furnace, it takes a good hour before we even see anyone in a furnace."}

For me, it was endless entertainment.\nLet me preface this by saying that I'm not sure that The Hunger Games is really for the younger kids out there. It's grim and violent. After all, it's about kids killing each other for the entertainment of a despot. So, PG-13 rating notwithstanding, you might want to reconsider bringing the kids to this. There are some scenes that could give them nightmares (even more so than Harry Potter).\nThe 75th Hunger Games are upon us, but President Snow (an oily Donald Sutherland) is not pleased that Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) were joint winners the previous year when they appeared to choose death over murder. In particular, Snow reviles Katniss, whom he views as a beacon of hope to the mostly impoverished denizens of Pandem's twelve districts.\nKatniss and Peeta are to embark upon a victory tour, stopping in each district and reading a quick eulogy to the fallen tributes of the previous games. But they must also put on a front that they are both deeply in love with one another, thus distracting people from their wretched lives, as is the intent of the Games. You might guess that this pretension doesn't go over well with Katniss.\nThe victory tour, however, is only the beginning. More games are afoot, and the lives of Katniss and Peeta are no longer the only ones at stake. There's a hint of unease in the air, particularly among the poorer regions of the land. Is Katniss Everdeen a symbol for rebellion? Some characters return, such as Caesar Flickerman, the Games' host (Stanley Tucci), the flamboyant Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), the designer Cinna (Lenny Kravitz), the cranky drunk Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), and the misnamed Snow. Along with new tributes, we meet a new gamesmaster, Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), who takes over for Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley) as the Machiavelli/Wizard of Oz.\nThe action is frantic, even more so than in in the first movie, and the obstacles facing Katniss - both emotional and physical - are still more debilitating and oppressive. Even though we - and the players - know that the arena is very much under human control, nothing is predictable.\nLawrence, if you can believe it, is better than ever. This time around, we get a little bit more of a look into her psyche, her reserved nature, and her longings. Katniss is as radiant and determined as ever, a fierce and intelligent young woman who is as vulnerable as the rest of us. And that alone makes her an ideal role model for kids, not just girls.\nA word to the wise - okay, a second word to the wise - in one way this movie reminds me of Back to the Future II. That movie was filmed at the same time as its successor, and although it is a fun movie in itself, it transparently served as a lead-in to Back to the Future III; similarly, this movie will not end as decisively as the first but rather on a dramatic, but satisfying precipice. It is a rare film that can tell a tale fluidly and not just leave the audience wanting more of the same but wanting to know precisely what happens in the seconds after the screen goes black. Catching Fire acts as both a wild ride of joy, despair, love, anger, and revenge and as a catalyst for the third and final installment."}

Chandor's All Is Lost is a thoughtful, existential-themed masterpiece, a multi-act play with only one character and no dialogue. It's expertly photographed, and it's supremely acted by the ageless vessel that is Robert Redford, as an Everyman lost at sea with little more than his wits to help him survive.\nRedford's Man - actually credited as \"Our Man\" - is sailing his 39-foot yacht in the Indian Ocean, some 1200 miles from Sumatra. As the film opens, he's awakened to water in his cabin; the boat has run up against a floating container of sneakers. He's in the middle of nowhere. He is able to patch the gaping hole in his boat's hull and sails on. But with his communications a shambles and his navigational tools on the fritz, he manages to sail directly into a terrifying storm.\nThus begins a riveting odyssey, a tale not just of man's struggle versus nature but of man's struggle versus himself; will Our Man reach his breaking point and succumb to the whims of the sea? When all does seem, indeed, lost, and hope has withered away, why does Our Man press on? It could be the strength of his character alone, because we know almost nothing about the man himself - not about loved ones waiting for him in a warm, dry home, not about friends, not about anything outside the confines of his boat.\nRedford is appropriately aces as Our Man, his perpetually weathered skin essaying experience and resourcefulness rather than tiredness and bitterness. It's not an easy role, because so much depends on the audience being able to get inside the sailor's mind without his needing to vocalize his thoughts. Redford, then, needs to use his facial expressions and other means to keep us in the loop. Aside from a few spoken narrative sentences, Our Man says nothing, and we see his attitude oscillate between helplessness and determination. \nThere is plenty of action, lest one think this is merely a cerebral exercise. There are two storms. Denizens of the sea make appearances. There are other obstacles as well, as Our Man's supplies run out and his body and mind grow weaker. It's a strongly compelling film.\nThis is no Cast Away on a boat. Our Man never goes full-out crazy, with hyperkinetic and overemotional histrionics to indicate a slipping mind. Rather, he's more or less focused on his task at hand, ultimate survival. Because Redford's characterization is so fully realized, it's very difficult not to empathize with him and to try to figure things out alongside him. When he runs low on water, you run low on water; when he figures out how to get more water, you're as relieved as he is. The cinematography by Frank DeMarco and Peter Zuccarini keeps us directly involved, glued to Our Man's plight from all angles - for example, almost every shot is fairly close, yielding an almost claustrophobic perspective.\nAll Is Lost is a brilliant film with a gritty performance by Robert Redford and assisted by tight direction and startling photography. It should be well remembered come award time."}

Is it inspiring? A laugh-out-loud comedy? Well, no and no - but it still mostly works, at least as well as any movie that combines transvestites, torch singers, gambling, and Viagra can.\nIt's The Hangover crossed with Space Cowboys. Four lifelong friends reunite for the bachelor party/wedding of one of their number - marrying a woman almost forty years his junior - in the titular town. Of course, there's some bitterness and resentment between two of them, and all four suffer from what one might call old-man-in-movies disease (see Red, for example). Each of the men has some sort of hangup or hangups that will be sorted out during this weekend of debauchery.\nBilly (Michael Douglas) is the groom-to-be. Billy is successful, possibly a real-estate magnate of some kind. I wasn't sure, but he did have a house that appeared to be floating in the water and did have a very young girlfriend (Bre Blair), so I assumed he was rich. It was a safe assumption. At any rate, Billy pops the question to young Lisa while delivering a eulogy, and before you know it the stage is set for a quickie Vegas wedding, just like all classy couples have.\nBilly calls two of his old pals, Sam and Archie, who immediately volunteer to throw the bachelor party. Sam (Kevin Kline) lives in Florida, where he's all too aware of his age, since he's constantly surrounded by old, old people (and has an artificial knee and hip, to boot). Archie lives with his son, daughter-in-law, and grandbaby and has suffered a mild stroke, so he's now babied to the point of silliness. Both men are prime candidates to get wild and crazy, but there's one slot left in their old gang, the Flatbush Four - that would be Paddy (Robert De Niro), who has lived in utter solitude since the passing of his beloved Sophie and who harbors plenty of ill will toward Billy.\nA few weighty issues are tackled here. Should Sam cheat on his wife, with her permission? (And is that cheating?) Should Archie feel guilty about telling his son he's gone on a church retreat? Should Billy actually marry a woman he may not love? Should Billy and Paddy talk out their differences like grownups, or should they passively/aggressively deal with it? The answers given by the characters probably won't surprise you much. \nBut for a movie that does pretty much stick to a standard formula, Last Vegas receives a big boost from its decorated cast. Counting Mary Steenburger, who plays Diana the singer, there are seven Oscars among five actors. Pretty impressive resumes, is what I'm saying here. It looks as if each of them really buys into the Writing 101 plot and therefore sells the heck out of it without resorting to scene chewing. Steenburgen, in particular, is both hilarious and graceful in a crucial supporting role. This is also a movie that reminds us how old Douglas is - he looks ancient here - and that Kline is still around. In fact, at first it seems weird that Kevin Kline, of all people, is considered an old guy, but he's only three years younger than Douglas. Huh.\nIn all, this is not a movie that's going to win any awards. The game cast does try hard and succeeds at the comic moments more than anything else. So, sure, it's a geriatric version of Tom Hanks' old Bachelor Party, but it does have some sweet elements to it as well as a few endearing performances. Lost Vegas is perhaps a movie best appreciated on a smaller screen"}

Driven by a powerful, soul-baring performance by the inimitable Tom Hanks, the movie never lags, never oversells the plight of its characters, never reduces anyone or anything to mere caricature.\nHanks is the titular captain of the United States container ship MV Maersk Alabama, cruising along the coast of Somalia with a full load and heading toward the horn of Africa. Two skiffloads of armed Somalis close in, ready to board the vessel. They're pirates, working for a warlord in their impoverished country, and they smell opportunity.\nIf this were a standard action flick, we might see the heroism of Phillips and his motley crew as they fight the evil pirates and save the world. It's not so here. There are nuances afoot; for once, we get the perspective of the lead pirate (Barkhad Abdi) without falling into the easy trap of feeling empathy toward him. \nThe pirates board the giant ship, clearly pleased with their find. Muse (Abdi) quickly proves himself to be a strong, humanistic leader; he's single minded (where's the crew? where's the goods?) but not sinister. His gang includes a strong man with a quick temper and Muse's own relative, who'd begged to come along on the mission - a mission that, when successful, would go a long way to improving their lives. \nThe movie is told in two distinct halves: the time spent by the pirates on the Maersk as they search in vain for treasure and crew, and the time spent in the ship's lifeboat as they make their way to Somalia. The villains are conflicted and desperate. And armed. But they're quickly immersed in an impossible situation. \nThis is one of the toughest, most naked performances of Hanks' stellar career. It's sometimes painful and heart wrenching to watch. He's an Everyman, per usual, but he's not also a savior or a hero. He doesn't suddenly develop super strength and overpower the bad guys. He's just a guy in charge of a boat and its passengers. \nMatching him wit for wit while frantically trying to keep his own wits about him is Abdi as the skinny, intelligent Muse, seemingly a veteran of high piracy (though not against huge container ships). Abdi is a wonder to watch; unpredictable and cunning but a little greedy and rapidly running out of viable options. Truly a talent to look out for, Abdi nails this role.\nThe ending is predictable only in the most general sense. Bill Ray's screenplay does not duck some plausible consequences to the actions of each main player and leaves us with a scene that is as emotionally overpowering as anything in Hanks' previous Philadelphia. \nIt seems that every time Tom Hanks makes a good movie, people begin to label it as \"Oscar bait,\" as if the movie were created just as a vehicle to earn an award. Captain Phillips delivers a tight, action-packed story fraught with none of the usual missteps of the genre, and if it is indeed rewarded with the highest of honors, it will be well deserved."}

It is both a concrete what-if story and a mesmerizing existential mindbender.\nThe U.S Space Shuttle Explorer is docked at the International Space Station. Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock), on her first space mission, is installing an external device on the station that will enable astronomers to peer even deeper into space. Meanwhile, the mission commander Kowalski (Clooney), on his final mission, merrily spacewalks in a jet pack; other crew members perform maintenance or communicate with Earth.\nThen trouble strikes. Houston reports that the Russians have blown up one of their own satellites, hurling debris throughout Earth's orbit. Before the crew can return to the shuttle and head back to Earth, the craft and the ISS are pounded with lots and lots of pieces of metal traveling at extreme speeds. The damage is extensive, setting off an odyssey for Dr. Stone that is both literal and figurative, as she must find a way to keep going and return back home.\nThere is hardly a moment of inaction. Stone and Kowalski veer from problem to problem, everything accentuate by the simple fact that they are alone up there, not even able to contact NASA. It's a terrifying situation. Most of us might have a slight panic attack if we're stranded on the side of the road without a cell phone. Imagine being up in the heavens with no way to get down.\nEmmanuel Lubezki's dizzying camera-work serves two purposes: it provides us with Stone's visual perspective, that of a novice, and it provides context for the disaster she and Kowalski find themselves in. If you think that the pictures from the Hubble telescope were beautiful, wait until you see these breathtaking visuals; they're as stirring and evocative as the acting and story itself.\nStone journey, as I mentioned, becomes more than just a path back to safety. She is grieving in her own way, becoming a quiet, almost listless passenger in life. Her decisions and her proactive attitude not only bring her closer to survival but also to a healing of her mind. This is definitely among Bullock's finest work, perhaps her greatest achievement to date.\nI've noted before that 3D movies in darkened environments, such as outer space, are utterly needless, since 3D actually removes light from scenes. But somehow, the 3D effects in Gravity sidestep that downside. The technology is used so expertly here that whether we are approaching an object at high velocity or it is approaching us, we feel immersed in the scene, not distracted from it. Tough to do.\nI simply cannot delve into the plot any more than I already have. The astute viewer will still have trouble guessing the outcome and the twists within the movie, particularly because the action is so hard- driven \u2013 while still utterly coherent and plausible.\nThere are plenty of heart-stopping moments in Gravity, even for the most jaded of viewers. It is fantastic storytelling supported by arresting cinematography. It may be too early for movies to get serious award- season consideration, but I'll come out and say this right now: Gravity is one of the very best movies of the year."}

The movie is paced a little bit too deliberately, and moments that should frighten with their suddenness are telegraphed well ahead of time by way of lingering, loving tracking shots. It's a movie without a message and with a minor- league plot, where solid performances are betrayed by an ungratifying ending and unrealistic (and unexplained) character development.\nI wanted so badly to like this movie. It's a horror film, part of a genre that appeals mostly to a particular set of people. Most people don't seem to just sort of tolerate horror movies; they're usually rabid fans or equally opinionated detractors. In any event, the intrigue of what a quiet, religious family in the middle of the woods might be up to attracted me to the film. Even after I discovered their secret (which may be common knowledge by now, but I won't spoil it), I was curious to know more - the family's folklore and what would happen to them by the end of the movie.\nThe Parker family is led by Frank (Bill Sage), a heavily bearded man of few words, the kind of guy who brooks no disobedience within his family. Very early in the movie, we meet Emma (Kassie DePaiva), Frank's wife, as she visits a local store for some last-minute items before the storm hits. It's soon evident that Mrs. Parker isn't quite right, and she quickly passes. This means that her responsibilities regarding the family's annual Lamb's Day are inherited by the eldest daughter, Iris (Ambyr Childs). Suddenly, Iris and her 14-year-old sister Rose (Julia Garner) are more involved than they have in the past, thus leading to internal doubts while they protect their little brother Rory (Jack Gore).\nPart of the suspense is supposed to involve what actually occurs on Lamb's Day. After Emma dies, a beloved book of hers is passed down to Iris, who learns it's been in the family since the 1700s. But most of what Iris reads is not news to her, and after we've heard just a little bit we can quickly grasp the situation. At this point, Iris, Rose, and Rory are presented as wholly sympathetic, unable to disobey their father but still complicit in his and their own actions. \nMeanwhile, as the store abates, the local doctor (Michael Parks) makes a discovery in a creek behind his house that begins to lead him toward the Parkers. Soon, law enforcement in the person of Deputy Anders (Wyatt Russell), is involved as well. We know what they've found, and we're able to seamlessly connect the find to what the Parker clan has been up to, so the suspense on that front is neutralized. The only remaining question is whether Frank Parker - and his kids - will emerge unscathed.\nSuspenseful movies, when done right, can expertly manipulate one's sense of dread. A tracking shot as a person approaches a closed door, then reaches for the handle; that can be very spine tingling. But similar shots in this movie took so long to develop that it quickly became obvious what was going to happen next, sort of the opposite of what a director would want his audience to feel.\nWhen we do arrive at the concluding scenes of the film, we're met with an ending that's so over the top that it jumps over the line of sanity into full-blown ludicrousness. It just doesn't make sense for some characters to behave one way for 99% of the film and then make a 180- degree turn in the waning moments. This makes for an ending that's not only offbeat and unpredictable (which would be good) but also implausible, irrational, and unintentionally hilarious. In fact, should you make it to the end, I dare you to not laugh at what's supposed to be scary, gross stuff.\nThe cast itself is very good, particularly Garner, Childs, and Parks; Kelly McGillis is also onboard as a suspecting neighbor and is fine. The only incongruent acting comes from Gore as the young Rory; in one particular scene, he's obviously supposed to be terrified but instead just looks really mad.\nWe Are What We Are is a movie without a point, with few new wrinkles to a specific subgenre, weighted down by slow-motion pacing and a mostly uneventful plot that culminates in an unlikely, unappealing ending."}

Alexandre Moors examines the events leading up to the killings, focusing on the unorthodox relationship between John Allen Muhammad and teenager Lee Boyd Malvo in Blue Caprice, an unfortunately lifeless, plodding film that somehow manages to turn a riveting situation into a dull character study that fails even on that level.\nOur story begins in the Caribbean, where John Allen Muhammad (Isaiah Washington) is vacationing with his three kids. Well, vacationing is a strong word, as apparently he's absconded with them from their mother, but more importantly this is where he runs into the young, lonely Lee Boyd Malvo (Tequan Richmond), who's just passing time after his mother's ditched him. Muhammad strikes up a paternal friendship with the boy and winds up bringing him to the United States, passing him off as his son.\nThe duo, now sans the children, wind up in Muhammad's old stomping grounds of Washington state, where they stay with John's old friend Ray (Tim Blake Nelson) and his wife Jamie (Joey Lauren Adams). While in Washington, Muhammad teaches his charge about life; specifically, how much it stinks and how killing a few people might be a good idea to square things with the world. \nWe follow Muhammad and Malvo essentially through the eyes of the boy. We learn he's a good shot with a handgun or a rifle (a natural, according to Ray, who knows nothing of Muhammad's plans). We see that Muhammad is the strong male influence on Malvo that the latter has probably never had. We learn that the kid, although quiet, has a cold, violent streak within him.\nOne reason the movie didn't work for me is that it seems to be perpetually building to some grand crescendo. Since this is based on a true story - with many facts accurate, according to my memory - the endgame is knowable. But for as much time is spent on the relationship between Malvo and Muhammad, it's a superficial treatment. What really makes either tick? We don't truly know. Even though Muhammad spouts off frequently about bringing down the system and how his ex-wife is evil, we don't really see how that resentment leaps into full-blown psychosis. In other words, what the heck really motivates him to kill innocent people? Moors doesn't even seem to speculate.\nWhen all is said and done, we don't really know any more about the deadly duo than we do when we first encounter them in the film. There's hardly any character development, and that's true of the secondary characters as well. To use the old axiom, there's no there there. There's nothing. Even the moments that should have one jumping out of one's seat - such as when Malvo pulls the trigger - are telegraphed so obviously that they lose most of their emotional impact.\nThis movie may be better received outside of the DC area. Most of the audience at this screening were in the area during the shootings, and the sentiment seemed to be one of apathy, sort of the opposite of what a tragedy like this should evoke. People who were not directly affected by the shootings may be more amenable to the short shrift given to the story development and glacial pacing."}

Most excellent!", "content": "In The World's End, five grownups who should know better return to the town of their youth to complete an legendary pub crawl, only to find out that the fate of the world rests in the balance. It's definitely one of the funniest movies I've seen this year. It's visceral comedy at its best, full of raunch and wit.\nBack in the day, the lads were at the top of their game and thought they could do it all. Led by Gary King (Simon Pegg), they attempt to hit twelve pubs in their town in one night. They don't make it. Now, many years later, Gary brings them all together so they can finish what they started. Among them are Steven (Paddy Considine), Oliver (Martin Freeman), Peter (Eddie Marsan), and Andy (Nick Frost), Gary's former closest chum. The years have been kind to them, but not to Gary, who's an addict of all sorts and stuck in the past - complete with the car and audio tapes he owned in 1989. Clearly, someone needs closure.\nAnd so it begins. The men move from pub to pub as they remember their last effort. The bartenders don't seem to recognize them, which makes sense to everyone except Gary, who always felt he was a bit of a celebrity in the town. Each pub seems to symbolize a moment from their earlier journey, so in a sense it's a metaphorical journey as well as a physical one, somewhat like that of Burt Lancaster in The Swimmer.\nOld quarrels are reignited, and the lads run into people from their past. But something seems a bit, well, off about them. A former flame (Rosamund Pike), Peter's sister, turns up as well. Former teachers and other barflies nod and murmur greetings, but little more. Something's up in this town, but is it more important than getting to Pub #12, the titular World's End? Not according to Gary.\nThe movie gives us another great reason to love Simon Pegg. Here, he's a degenerate lowlife who never grew up, a man with many demons and no intention of exorcising a single one. It's not Pegg's normal role, and yet he aces it. Sure, this is an Edgar Wright comedy, thus putting Pegg in his wheelhouse, but the character is so un-Pegg-like that's a wonder to behold. Just as Gary was the driving force in high school, so is Pegg the driving force - literally, in some scenes, as he drives his friends into town - of the film. \nThere are many conflicts. Gary, although he doesn't really show it, battles himself. He firmly believes that it's important for his own psyche to complete this crawl, that the closure may ease his mind, maybe make things better. Then there's a conflict between Gary and Steven, who each had a thing for Peter's sister. And of course there's a conflict between Gary and Andy, who haven't spoken in years. Each of these conflicts is irrefutably believable, and the cohesion of the cast really seals the deal.\nAnd then, a little more than midway through the movie, something happens that dramatically changes the whole point of the pub crawl. Well, for everyone except Gary, anyway. You may have already read about the MacGuffin somewhere else, but I'm not going to spoil it here, because it's really funny when it makes its appearance. Even with this new arrival, the tone of the movie doesn't change dramatically - it's still a comedy with plenty of action. Blistering, electric action, as a matter of fact. The fight scenes depart from normal action movies by being actually comprehensible - one can discern who is fighting whom or what. \nFor me, there were plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, many of them related to Gary's blissful lack of self awareness. Pegg's comic timing remains impeccable, and his chemistry with Frost remains deliciously strong and vibrant. Frost and Pegg make this film a raucous, uproarious, devilish chucklefest, and you can quote me on that.\nThe World's End is an electric comedy, replete with stinging barbs that singe but do not cause permanent injury. It's truly a one of a kind movie of a journey into weird, illogical, and confounding waters."}

But the movie is disappointing, giving the viewer no reason to empathize with any of the bitter, cruel, self-absorbed, and/or reckless characters, particularly the titular protagonist.\nAs the film opens, Jasmine (Cate Blanchett) has arrived out West. It's apparent Jasmine has some psychological issues; she has a tendency to talk to no one in particular and swallow large quantities of Xanax. In short order, she meets up with her sister Ginger (Sadie Hawkins), who lives in a working-class SF neighborhood with her two boys. The contrast between the two is striking: Jasmine is willowy, elegant, and graceful, and yet unstable; Ginger is unassuming, not terribly stylish, and much more down to earth. It's made clear that the sisters are adopted, and not from the same parents; still, they were raised together.\nAllen frequently bounces from the present to the past, filling in the blanks of what brought Jasmine to this stage in her life. Her husband Hal (Alec Baldwin), a high-powered financier, apparently led quite a duplicitous life, both as a philanderer and as a law breaker. By the time Hal is caught by the Feds, he's lost a lot of money invested by others, including Ginger and her then-husband, Augie (Andrew Dice Clay). So there's a lot of resentment of Jasmine on the part of Ginger.\nWhat are we to make of Jasmine? She lived a lavish lifestyle, only to see everything vanish. She has nothing; oddly enough, though, she can afford a first-class ticket and nice luggage. Jasmine seems to suffer from a supreme lack of self awareness - it never occurs to her to not fly first class or to sell items to have some cash on hand. She even overtips the cabbie who brings her to Ginger's house.\nIf Jasmine is somewhat of an unappealing character, what of Ginger? She seems very nice, if naive. Her boyfriend Chili (Bobby Cannavale) is a bit overbearing and definitely earthy, and he takes an instant disliking to Jasmine. The feeling is mutual, and Jasmine, intentionally or not, jabs her sister by frequently noting that Chili is a verifiable loser. Even two men whom the sisters separately encounter (Peter Sarsgaard and Louis C.K.) are jerks in their own right, on their own terms. \nWhen the lead character is not very likable, I look for growth or at least an attempt at self improvement, and herein lies my disappointment. No one, least of all Jasmine, seems to learn anything along the way, despite changing circumstances and spiraling fortunes. The movie is almost a self-fulfilling prophecy in that insults lobbed between characters turn out to be fairly legitimate, not wild character assassinations.\nBlanchett is marvelous as always, playing a difficult character. Hawkins, Baldwin, Cannavale, and C.K. all do quite well, also. But here's the big surprise for me - Andrew Dice Clay turns in some terrific work here in his few scenes. That chest-puffing Neanderthal from 20 years ago remains but is now channeled into authentic acting. Despite tepid plot and character development, Clay is able to knock this out of the park. That is not a sentence I expected to ever write.\nAs with most Woody Allen films, the soundtrack and the cinematography are rich and delightful. It would have been nice if the same attention had been paid to the plot, which feels almost recycled from Allen films from the early 1980s - except with neither wit nor wisdom. The movie essentially asks us to watch characters in a pool of their own filling, as they drown themselves and each other. Instead of moving from point A to point B, the plot takes a detour to points M, R, and T and then winds up back at A, as if nothing of any consequence happened in the previous 90 minutes."}

You're Next is an unequivocal scare ride, impressive enough to make one forgive the occasional lapses in logic.\nFirst to arrive are the mother and father, Paul and Aubrey. They plan to renovate the house, sort of a retirement project for Paul (who had worked for a defense contractor). Shortly thereafter, Aubrey thinks she hears footsteps upstairs. Paul goes to check it out but finds nothing. Meanwhile, son Crispian (yes, that's his name) is driving up with his girlfriend Erin; he's a teacher of some repute who's probably not as successful as he'd like to be. His two brothers and sister and their respective significant others are to arrive the next day. Crispian seems like a nice enough fellow, and he explains to Erin that his family hasn't been all together in a long time. \"It'll be...interesting,\" he tells her that night. \"How so?\" she asks. \"You'll see,\" he adds mysteriously. At this point we're supposed to grasp that there are long- standing issues among the family members, as is not unheard of.\nThe next day, the rest of the guests are on the scene. There's noticeable tension between Crispian and his brother Drake, as well as between Drake and the youngest brother, Felix. One gets the impression that there're been plenty of bickering and sniping over the years. Drake picks on both of his brothers plus his sister's boyfriend Tariq, a documentary director. And then the attack begins, and chaos reigns.\nPeople are picked off, shot by bow and arrow or hit with an axe. Some try to go for help, to no avail. Cell phone service is down, too. No one knows who's attacking the family, it seems; is this a random event, or were they selected for extermination? \nWhile most of the guests are loudly panicking, only Erin has the wherewithal to act quickly and decisively. She knows how to use weapons, including her own body. She knows how to keep intruders out. For example, she has the idea of people rushing out of the dining room while holding a chair, thus giving them some cover. She takes charge better than anyone else there seemingly can. It's not really important why she possesses these skills; it's just enough to know she can employ them. Makes for a better movie than watching a family get cut down, that's for sure.\nThere are two things that intrigued me in this movie. One is the dazzling, breathless direction by Adam Wingard (V/H/S), which puts the viewer right in the middle of everything. This not only makes it tough to think about the motives of the family members but also gives the viewer almost no time to contemplate anything other than pure survival. Just like the family members. Aha. The second is that underlying question of why the family is being attacked, for if they've been specifically targeted, is it because the family has money, or some other, equally nefarious reason?\nHere are some caveats, though: the attackers seem pretty dumb, when all is said and done. Their dumbness doesn't detract from the action/violence/plot, anyway, so it's not a real issue. Along the same lines, the method behind all of the madness seems a little sketchy, even far fetched. But it's not implausible, so again it doesn't detract from the mayhem.\nSo it turns out I liked You're Next quite a bit, although those who aren't thrilled with blood and guts and such should really not bother. There's nothing for you here. There is a story, and it's a pretty interesting one, serving as a nice backdrop for the murdering and whatnot."}

Fast-moving, tense, and dark, this is not one of those laughable underwritten suspense movies with more special effects than actual plot. It's the kind of movie that slowly builds for a half hour or so before figuratively unleashing itself upon its audience. \nIn the same vein as 1979's The Amityville Horror, a family moves into an old farmhouse in Harrisville, Rhode Island. It's 1971. People have porkchop sideburns and wear loud pants. Roger Perron (Ron Livingston) and Carolyn Perron (Lili Taylor) have five - count 'em, five - daughters and a dog. The house was cheap. It didn't take long for the family to find out they picked the wrong farmhouse to inhabit. Yep, you guessed it, malevolent spirits. \nLegs are literally pulled in the middle of the night. A smell not unlike rotten eggs comes and goes. Various pieces of furniture, left behind by previous owners, shake and rattle. There's a boarded-up basement. An old music box is found by an even older tree by a deceptively tranquil stream. Pictures fall. Everyone, particularly the kids, is terrified.\nDesperate for help, Carolyn contacts the Warrens, Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga). Ed is a demonologist - yes - and Lorraine is a clairvoyant. As soon as they step over the threshold of the Perron house, Lorraine sees a presence, and she and Ed, both veterans of investigating the paranormal, are soon faced with the most treacherous, beguiling case of their lives.\nThe framework of the movie is that of a traditional haunted-house story, with the terror turned up past 11. That's because - no spoiler here - there are multiple spirits about, although they share a common ancestor, spiritually speaking. Roger and Carolyn are helpless, which we expect; Ed and Lorraine are as well, which we do not. Also, poor Lorraine has already suffered tremendous emotional trauma from previous investigations. Even if and when the investigators can determine the root of the Perrons' problem, they may not be sufficiently equipped to deal with them, even with their cameras, infrared devices, temperature sensors, and the help of assistant Drew and police officer Brad.\nThis movie is terrifying. Director James Wan is an expert at manipulating light and sound to heighten our sense of dread and fear. When Carolyn descends into the cellar, we descend with her, our hearts palpitating like a lawnmower. Both Ed and Carolyn are inherently relatable, as are their five daughters. Who hasn't played a game like Hide and Clap? (It's sort of like Blind Man's Bluff or Marco Polo, on land.) This is definitely one of the scariest movies of the year, and thankfully it wasn't released in 3D. There are long tracking shots that will exhaust and exhilarate; off-camera noises sound closer and closer with each pressing, bottled-up moment. \nThere is very little blood, but don't be fooled into thinking this is a harmless movie for kids, either. Whereas The Amityville Horror was almost cartoonish - bleeding walls? - The Conjuring relies most heavily on the human psyche for its fright attack. And it is very, very successful at scaring one almost breathless. There are a lot of things to love about this movie, from its creepy atmosphere juxtaposed with its all-American family to the evocative acting by all of the principals, particularly Farmiga and Taylor, for whom this is her best role to date. No character feels generic or ill-formed, and the intricate, tortuous plot is complex without being complicated. This is a movie to see."}

The boy's family quickly retrieves him, but it's soon obvious that something is awry. Is it possible this is not their little boy after all? The Imposter's title gives you a strong indication to the answer to that question, but there's much more to the story.\nThis is a documentary, so let us begin with some cold facts. The story is propelled by interviews given by the real-life people at the center of the drama. Right away, we are introduced to one Frederic Bourdin, a 23-year-old Frenchman. His mission: find and steal the identity of a teenager. It turns out to be a little harder than one might imagine, particularly when the boy chosen by Bourdin turns out to be a cause celebre, and thus Bourdin is not able to simply escape the clutches of the Spanish police but instead must continue his ruse as he's taken to the United States.\nAlong the way, he asks himself why the boy's family is so eager to accept him as young Nicholas. Bourdin has beard stubble and dark hair, whereas teenage Nicholas was blonde and a bit too young to shave. But accept them they do. Is this simply a case where the family just wanted so desperately to believe that their boy was back that they overlooked obvious discrepancies? Or did they have something else to hide?\nIn addition to Bourdin himself, interviews with his older sister, his mother, his brother in law, and his brother - along with law-enforcement officials both local and national (including Interpol) - are interspersed throughout the movie. It is only from these subjective interviews that the audience can make any assumptions or deductions, as director Bart Layton doesn't push the plot in any particular direction. Well, not at first. For a good part of the movie, we are led to conclude two things: that Bourdin is certainly not Nicholas and that Nicholas' family is surely aware of this.\nAnd then, from almost nowhere, an allegation arises that cannot be revealed here. Does it seem plausible? Yes. Is it supported in the movie as a valid theory? Not entirely. It is at this point where the director introduces the allegations behind which he also throws his own weight, a bit of a departure from the plot to that point. Layton seems to believe this allegation has at least a grain of truth - he is not the only one in the movie to think so, although there appears to be no direct evidence to support it.\nAnd that's a shame. Up until then, the movie seems almost amiable: the lovable rogue sneaking into the U.S. by pretending to be someone much younger, fooling officials but not the family, which doesn't care anyway. After the tone shifts (abruptly), the movie itself changes - now it's much more of a mystery, and unfortunately it's one without a satisfying resolution.\nIf this were a work of fiction, the movie could have been effective if it was able to delve into the minds and actions of the Gibson family. Because the movie is nonfiction, throwing in plot devices that may or may not be factual would have been unethical and embarrassing. But it would have been far more entertaining than The Imposter, which promises a lot but cannot deliver on the tone set by its creepy, unsettling premise."}

Or, at least, it didn't work nearly as well as the previous two, which were near masterpieces. Before Midnight is a talkfest, which is not a problem, but it's a boorish talkfest, which sort of is. It has moments of absolute brilliance surrounded by what feel like epochs of people arguing and giving no ground. It may be realistic, but it's sure uncomfortable to watch at times.\nWe catch up with Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) in Greece, where they are vacationing with their twin daughters. They are returning to a friend's house after dropping off Jesse's son at the airport - you might recall he married and had a kid between the first and second movies - and converse while their girls sleep in the back. Jesse is still the rakish, if unshaven, man he's always been, and Celine is still utterly beautiful. But whereas in the previous movies there had been love lost and found, here there may be love lost, period; there is something afoot in their relationship. There are many areas of stress, many complications in their lives, and from the beginning the viewer suspects a break up is around the corner.\nThe movie is a bit of a cross between Scenes from a Marriage and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Well, more precisely, to Scenes from a Mall, Woody Allen's homage to Bergman's Marriage. There's a lot of talking, and some deep-seated feelings are revealed, some inadequacies and vulnerabilities laid bare. Is the relationship on the rocks? It may depend on your own prejudices. I'm probably prejudiced to take Jesse's side, because for the life of me I saw him as the victim (to be fair, only for the most part) and Celine as the aggressor. I'm not quite sure how to process that; do I feel that way because that's what I was seeing or because it was what I expected or could better relate to? I'm not sure. But I can tell you this for certain: each conversation between Celine and Jesse seemed to veer from tenderness to viciousness quicker than a jackrabbit doing handstands while on meth. It became hard to witness after a while, because Hawke and Delpy are both so good that one was immediately invested in their prospects. For me, that meant I would go from being joyful at the love each obviously (still) felt for one another to cringing at the sight of their malicious bickering.\nThe enduring question arises: if either had the chance to do it over, would Celine get on the train with Jesse, and would Jesse ask Celine to get on the train with him? We get conflicting answers, as if each is testing the other's fidelity while professing not to care. One minute they're happy to grow old together, the next each is questioning the other's motives. For Jesse, he feels that his son's childhood is slipping away and wishes he were more a part of it (in Chicago, rather than France); for Celine, she has a chance to take a better job with a man she dislikes but is caught between doing something for herself and doing something for the family in general and Jesse in particular. The bouncing back and forth between melodrama and quiet, romantic interplay is jarring, even if it is realistic. I'm certainly not saying this is how many relationships go, not at all; it's just that I wouldn't want to witness one of these euphemistically named discussions in person, either. It's not entertaining, even if it's real, like eavesdropping on an old married couple across the hall while they argue about duvets or table runners or something equally mundane, only with the conviction of Patrick Henry asking for liberty.\nAs with the earlier films, the movie focuses almost exclusively on conversations between our two leads, with two exceptions: one is a group dinner in which (surprise) truths are revealed, and the other is two scenes in one, with Jesse talking to the men in the film and Celine to the women. Every scene is a cornucopia of philosophies, some earthy and some pretentious, some with hidden meanings within the plot's framework, some existing just to exist. One needs to have one's head on a swivel to keep up with the changes in tone and the number of intentionally misunderstood phrasings.\nThe sheer poetic chemistry between Hawke and Delpy remains palpable as ever. Delpy is outstanding - lovely, sparkling, and passionate. Hawke, who's made quite a name for himself as a scruffy Gen-X nonslacker, is also superb. And Linklater's direction is surehanded. It's just that, in the end, it feels as if nothing has changed, that the previous two hours meant nothing to the characters. The movie took me on such a emotional ride that, rather than be enthralled, I was exhausted and spent by its middling conclusion."}

This isn't some over-sanitized Disney movie. Everything from the lighting to the characters to the tense plot adds up to something you wouldn't want your six-year-old to drag you to, unless you don't mind paying for some therapy. But it's a terrific movie, with a style all its own and a madcap sense of ghoulish delight.\nNorman (voice of Kodi Smith-McPhee) is an outcast. Know why? He talks to dead people. And indeed, we see them as well, chatting with our hero along his walk to school. Oh, and his grandmother (voice of Elaine Stritch) talks to him all the time while sitting on the couch in the living room. No one understands poor Norman, who's as resignedly freaked out as Haley Joel Osment in the Sixth Sense, so he has no one to talk to, not his parents (Jeff Garlin and Leslie Mann), not his sister (Anna Kendrick), and not the school bully (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) for sure. \nIt's only when Norman has an episode during the production of a school play (not coincidentally, about an old legend surrounding the town's dark past) that he gains a friend - another outcast, the portly Neil (Tucker Albrizzi), who teaches Norman that it's best not to let people bother you, to not let them get under your skin. Had the story ended there, we may have had a nice, tidy after-school special. Oh, but it does not! From out of almost nowhere, Norman's black-sheep uncle, Mr. Prenderghast (John Goodman), a heavily bearded, slightly loony chap, informs Norman that he - Norman! - must take the mantle of He Who Holds Off the Witch's Curse. Mr. P. has been doing it for all these years, but he thinks he's about to go. He warns Norman that it's all up to him and he must read from the book and then he dies. That was an intentional run-on sentence, for your pleasure.\nThereby our plot is set in motion! Norman must extricate said book from the dead uncle and then read it by the witch's grave in order to break the curse that no one really believes is real. They don't believe it on account of Mr. Dead Uncle has been reading from the book for his entire life, and someone before him, and so on. But now Dead Uncle is, you know, demised, and just before the witch is to rise from the ashes and wreak havoc! Oh, I should note that the curse goes like this - a little girl was suspected of witchcraft by the town elders and sentenced to death. So you can see why she might want to haunt those elders and the town itself for all eternity.\nThere are people raised from the dead, and the imagery is quite striking; bones, stringy hair, rent clothing, and the ability to remove an appendage and reattach it. Are these - uh - zombies - out to lay waste to the town? Or are they victims of their own device? It's up to Norman, his brain, and his innate ability to talk to dead people to somehow save the day. Despite being grounded, of course.\nParaNorman works on many levels. Adults will love the stylish, almost Gothic atmosphere; older teens will love the menace of both the zombies and the townspeople, not to mention the witch herself. There are, for an animated film, plenty of scares and dark themes - slightly offset by the themes of loneliness, friendship, heroism, and getting adults to just listen to you. For once! Ahem. Anyway, there's a sort of beauty in ParaNorman, as horror and light comedy are somehow blended to form a rich animated film."}

It's a fast-moving, intricate, and solidly acted by the indomitable Brad Pitt.\nOkay, sure, the \"Z\" stands for zombies (in the book and in the film), but let's be frank (or Bob or Justine) - these aren't zombies, really. Well, they're sort of a cross between a zombie and the victims of the Rage virus from 28 Days Later. The bitten turn into homicidal maniacs about ten seconds after infection has set in. But they're attracted to noise and to life itself, so essentially if you both have a terminal disease and are really quiet, they won't see you. These infected are sort of like the T. Rex of the human populace.\nBrad Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a former UN employee with some knowledge about infectious disease. He's driving his kids to school and his wife (Mirielle Enos) to work in Philadelphia when it happens - sudden stop of traffic followed by cars crashing, police scrambling, and finally, a horde of contaminated peoples running amok over the city, coming after those who still live. This sets off the expected chain of events of Gerry and his family ushered out of Newark, NJ to a ship in the North Atlantic, from where the UN is running its operation of Find the Cause. The UN, in the person of Thierry Umutoni (Fana Mokoena), pulls Gerry into the scrum: they feel he's their man; he's the one who can find out not only where the infection began but how to stop it.\nGerry's adventures take him to such incongruous places as South Korea, Israel, and Wales at a frenetic pace. Some scenes are eerily reminiscent of John Carpenter's The Thing; in one, Gerry and a military escort must silently pedal bikes to a plane for refueling, so as not to alert the walking dead and thus turn them into running dead. It's a creepy, chilling scene, and never has riding a bike looked so difficult.\nNow, if you've read the book by Max Brooks and plan to see this movie, you should know that the overall structure of Brooks' book (narration by Lane) is jettisoned for a more straightforward action-movie approach. And you might well be put off by that at first, but once you get over your faux outrage, you may discover that the movie is actually the better for the change; the result is much more suspenseful and riveting on the big screen than a true adaptation might have been.\nI like Brad Pitt, and this makes up for Killing Them Softly in spades. He's his usual terrific self as Gerry, who isn't some hardscrabble, world-weary action guy but rather an authentic everyman who could be any of us, only with better hair. His Lane is shown to be quite vulnerable (physically and psychologically), and Pitt's able to pull it off magnificently - unlike, say, a Tom Cruise or a Leonardo DiCaprio (the latter made a heavy bid for the rights to Brooks' tome). This is part of what makes Pitt such a fine actor. He's malleable; he can play bad guy, good guy, action hero, clever bastard, and so on without looking out of his element. He is the driving force of this film.\nAs I mentioned, the movie moves (shambles?) at a quick pace. Ordinarily, this might mean that there's little plot involved, but if anything the movie is overplotted. Thankfully, time isn't wasted trying to explain to us every little detail about how Lane arrives at certain conclusions or on secondary or tertiary characters and their reasons for being where they are. It's a succinct plot that makes the best use of its runtime.\nWorld War Z, although perhaps not a true zombie film (are the victims killed and then turn or are are they infected and then turn?), is a perfectly good adrenaline-rush movie with a punchy, intelligent script and a typical knockout performance by Pitt."}

It's a really thoughtful slice-of-life seriocomedy with a touch of whimsy and plenty of relatability and not the slightest bit as pretentious as it could have been.\nMatt Pandamiglio (Mike Birbiglia) tends bar at a hotspot that also occasionally has comics onstage. He's been in a relationship with Abby (Lauren Ambrose) for more than eight years, and she's been hinting strongly at marriage and babies and the like, which has poor Matt a little discombobulated. (Hint: he's not sure he's ready, nor good enough, for that.) He hems and haws and just can't commit. Sounds like a typical dude, right? In a way, sure, which makes Matt all the more like the rest of us. And luckily, because Birbiglia (who co-wrote the screenplay with Ira Glass of NPR) is so, well, normal, the role is imbued with a strong layer of honesty. This is not some glossy Hollywood romcom.\nBut Matt has an unusual, additional problem: he sleepwalks. Oh, he doesn't just go into another room, sit down, get up, then go back to bed. Matt's walking is much more violent in nature; he is prone to acting out his dreams, which may mean fighting someone (a shower curtain) or even walking repeatedly into a wall. It's disturbing, to say the least, and his father (James Remar), a no-nonsense doctor, insists that Matt see a specialist immediately, as in now. But Matt shrugs it all off, thinking he needs to focus on his career and his girl, and not necessarily in that order.\nThis is not to say that Matt is a bad guy. He gets a chance at the bar to tell some jokes, and he finds an agent as a result, which soon has him crisscrossing the Northeast US, doing small gigs for actual pay. It's fascinating to see someone so dedicated, driving hundreds of miles to make $100 or so, then driving hundreds more in the opposite direction to make a little more. It's tough work, and only those who truly believe they've found their spot in life's grand scheme will undertake it.\nIt's only when Matt begins to work his real life into his performances that his career takes a genuinely positive turn, a little fact that he keeps from Abby. Now, his combination of observational humor and relationship woes works very well with his audiences, and he begins to develop a name for himself. But where, you might ask, does that leave Abby?\nThat is what I liked the very most about this film. Now, bear in mind that this is a comedy more than anything else, so it is practically assured of a happy ending. And it gets one - just not the one you might expect to get. And the ending works. It works emphatically well, a terrific coda to a beautiful, sincere film about a schlub and his art and his girl. Because Birbiglia is so perfect for the role (yes, he wrote it, but how often does that mean he can act it as well), the movie is a by-gosh success. It's a movie without a Bad Guy. It's a movie that doesn't look at a relationship between a man and a woman and ask the audience to choose one for whom to root. Both Abby and Matt are good people (though you kind of wonder what Abby really sees in Matt other than being able to make her laugh); they're just not necessarily right for each other.\nSleepwalk with Me is, indeed, a true sleeper of a movie. It stars an unknown commodity (both as an actor and as a comic) in a movie he wrote himself, often a recipe for disaster. And yet despite those long odds, the movie is compelling and perfectly told, narrated by Birbiglia himself (often speaking into a camera directly as if he were filming a documentary on his life). Are there laughs? There are laughs. There are laughs complemented by poignancy and optimism. Sleepwalk with me is a well-formed, quirky film that's decidedly outside of the cookie-cutter Hollywood milieu."}

Critics would slam the movie for its lack of plausibility and incoherence. It is only the veracity of the plot that prevents us from having to suspend disbelief, because it truly happened.\nThis is the famed recent story of a fast-food manager who, upon receiving a call from a policeman, is asked to detain and search an employee suspected of stealing money from a customer. The shame doesn't end with a simple inspection of pockets and purse; there is a strip search and more. All the while, the restaurant is packed with people and few staff. It's a stressful situation.\nImagine you're Sandra (Ann Dowd), the manager. A cop's on the phone. You believe him when he says your young employee Becky (Dreama Walker) is thought to be a thief and that the policeman has the victim and is on his way and just needs Sandra to keep Becky there. Oh, and look for the money. Would you follow the orders given by this voice? You might. You're already in trouble because someone left the freezer open, spoiling meat and other supplies; you know the staff doesn't like you too much; you know that Becky herself, being young enough to be your daughter, isn't a big fan of yours. So you readily accept the man's word and detain your miscreant.\nTo agree, I think we all would. But then things get a little weird. Would you consent to strip searching said employee? If you were the young lady, would you allow it to happen? What if it escalated? Would you, as manager, stop and think that maybe things aren't as they appear? Would you question anything?\nApparently Sandra wouldn't. And knowing that this was a true story - in fact, several true stories - forced me to accept that there are people who accept things so readily. Sandra never stops to consider the strangeness of a policeman asking staff to do a strip search, never really questions why it can't wait until the police arrive (they're constantly on their way). Why? Probably a fear of losing her job (she's told the district manager is on the other line, plus the freezer incident), a fear of losing control of the restaurant (it's packed), a fear of seeming inept.\n\"Sandra, I didn't steal anything, you know I wouldn't!\" \"I know, honey, but we have to do what the disembodied voice says...\" Paraphrasing is fun.\nAt any rate, since this did happen in real life, I had to try to see beyond how obscenely dumb people behaved in the movie and allow the actors and director to sell the plot. They failed. In other words, while I had to believe that the scenario would play out in real life, the players couldn't convince me that it could play out in the same way in their own movie. See, just because something happens in real life doesn't mean it is automatically plausible; sometimes the implausible can happen, and sometimes the plausible will not. But the makers of this movie felt the based-on-a-true-story was more than enough. And normally, it would be, with a competent cast and crew, but here a little extra effort was necessary to show that this plot was not only plausible but likely, and that effort is missing throughout the movie - particularly from Dowd's Sandra, around him the movie essentially revolves. (Other characters in the movie do, at times, express concern and suspicion, but Sandra is oblivious to their remarks.) \nThe result is a bullheaded, laughable mess with little going for it. It's almost painful to watch - and, in fact, contains scenes that will make you wince with embarrassment on the part of the actors. It's like watching an ant try to climb a mountain of sand. With a watermelon strapped to its back. The actions of the various characters would make sense over a short period of time, but the more time passes, the less understandable their actions become. And that's the undoing of the entire greasy mess. You probably won't feel entertained or informed after watching this film, except in that you shouldn't make assumptions about who's on the other end of the telephone line. Compliance is a slime-riddled, exploitative movie with no credibility."}

The Dictator is about another foreigner who's in America but utterly clueless about the ways of the States. In this case, more is good; the movie more than makes up for the travesty that was Bruno (shudder) and manages to again inject quite a bit of satire at America and its denizens.\nSacha Baron Cohen plays Hafez Aladeen, ruler of a small African nation that's sort of a stand in for Iran. They might have nukes. They might be weaponizing their plutonium. No one knows. The UN issues an ultimatum (that's how you know it's satire): come to New York and explain yourself to us or we'll take corrective measures. Aladeen, as counseled by his associate Tamir (Sir Ben Kingsley), finally concedes and heads to the Big Apple, strutting around the city astride an elephant. He's all about showmanship, Aladeen. At any rate, he's abducted almost as soon as he arrives at his hotel but escapes his captors - but sans his trademark beard. Now, you just don't go around cutting people's beards off, unless you're part of the Amish Mafia, and even then there are repercussions. So here we have Aladeen, alone on the streets of New York, desperately trying to get back into the hotel where he is to give his speech.\nOf course everything goes awry. Somehow he finds himself at a co-op run by Zoey (Anna Faris), a stereotypical no-armpit-shaved feminist (hey, I didn't write this script) who believes in diversity and kindness and giving people a chance, all things that Aladeen deplores. So he gets a job there. Why? Because as the plot would have it, her company has the contract to supply the hotel with food. Nice coincidence, no?\nUnlike Borat, The Dictator does not rely on the unscripted reactions of average Americans; it's an honest-to-goodness movie. And it is really, really fun if it catches you in the right mood. And you don't mind being grossed out (hint: watch for the cell phone/birth scene). As you might guess, as Aladeen (or, as he is known to Zoey, \"Allison Burgers\") plots to return to the hotel, give a grand speech about how dictators rule and democracies drool, and rip up his country's ostensible new constitution, he is gradually falling for Zoey. Wouldn't you know it. Hey, any lady who teaches you how to self pleasure must be a keeper, right? At least he doesn't have her beheaded.\nLook, a lot of the comedy is juvenile, more so than man-child Adam Sandler, but somehow Cohen makes it really work well. Aladeen has lovingly oppressed his people for years and plans to keep doing so, UN be damned, but adviser Tamir has other plans. Ordinarily, you'd side with Tamir, wouldn't you? Eh, not so fast, my friend. Trust me, there's a darn good reason to not like Tamir and his motives.\nThe movie plays on American's post-9/11 fears and its heightened senses of both security-as-theater and, well, insecurity. Maybe they really ARE out to get us! There's a hilarious scene in a tourist helicopter in which two fellow riders confuse the conversation that Aladeen is having with his compatriot Nadal for a plot to bomb the U.S. Why? Well, two Middle-Eastern-looking men who mention \"bin Laden\" and \"9/11\" and \"9/11 2012,\" with one of them wearing a back brace that, to the untrained eye, looks like a suicide bomber's attire. Too soon? Nah, it's not, because Cohen's satire is so on target.\nThere's a speech given at the end that compares the wonders of dictatorship to the restrictions of democracy. You have to see this speech. If only our leaders saw it for what it was and would act accordingly."}

That's my first advice to those who watch Now You See Me, an otherwise-terrific psychological thriller with a magical theme, in at least one sense of the word. The movie relies on the staple of the magician's act, the sleight of hand, as it repeatedly tells its audience that the closer one looks, the less likely they are to discover the secret. It's an axiom that can be applied to the movie as well. It's fast moving, competently acted, and contains genuine twists - especially the last one, which is a doozy.\nOur story begins with the solo acts of four magicians: the mentalist Merrit McKinney (Woody Harrelson), the showman Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), the spoon-bender Jack Wilder (Dave Franco), and the stunt specialist Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher). After each concludes a performance, he or she finds a Tarot card directing them to a particular apartment building in New York. Behind that door, the fun begins.\nSome time later, the four - christened The Four Horsemen - perform a most unusual act in Las Vegas. Using a volunteer from the audience, they somehow manage to rob a bank in France. Ridiculous? Yes, of course it is - but there you are, nonetheless. The money is missing. What's more, it suddenly rains money into the crowd. Crowd goes wild. This, of course, gains the attention of not only the FBI, in the person of Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) but also Interpol, in the person of Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent). How in the world did the money get from Paris to Vegas? Oh, this is only the beginning.\nNext up is New Orleans. This time, McKinney plays a fun little trick on the group's benefactor, Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine); he has everyone in the audience write down the amount that's presently in their bank account. Then he has the audience look at the number using a flashlight from under the seats. Meanwhile, the group brings out a giant check that lists Tressler's bank holdings. As time passes, the amount on Tressler's check declines, while those of audience members increase. How is this possible?\nEach time the FBI and Interpol think they've grabbed an ankle of the magicians, they've grabbed nothing more than thin air. Atlas and company are at least three steps ahead of everyone. But why? What is really behind all of this? What's the endgame?\nThe key - and this is not a spoiler by any measure - is to bear this in mind: watch everything, but not too closely. There are clues everywhere. And when all is said and done, the last trick complete, the final twist may well shock you into silence. And I sort of like that. I love a movie that can pirouette from one direction to the next, a bit of sleight-of- hand, if you will, with the new direction just as plausible as the first. Misdirection is all afoot in this caper. It's all about what you look at but can't see.\nNow You See Me was cowritten by Boaz Yakin. Don't know the name? Well, he also wrote such luminous films as Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, Prince of Persia, Safe, and From Dusk Till Dawn 2. Not quite the pedigree you'd expect for this quality film. Maybe it's the artful direction of Louis Leterrier, who helmed the first two Transporter films and the Clash of the Titans remake. Not a lot of pizazz in that list, is there? Still, somehow, it works. Everything seems to click. The cast has great chemistry, and the performances are (mostly) nuanced just enough to stay out of the path of a gripping script. Eisenberg's Daniel is essentially the same as Eisenberg's MarK Zuckerberg - smug, cocky, supersmart. Harrelson's Merrit is condescending, a has-been with little going for him. Fisher's Henley, though underdeveloped, adds needed estrogen to the quartet - with the undercurrent of having worked with Daniel as his assistant. And Dave Franco - yes, Dave - is good as the youngest of the bunch; Franco is basically a clone of his older brother James, who I swore up and down this was. Huh. Ruffalo, Laurent, Common, Caine, and Morgan Freeman (as a professional debunker of magicians) round out the cast.\nOne final note about this. Even after the all the magic, the heists, the twists, and the reveals, the very ending is ambiguous. It's like watching someone walk through a doorway without letting you see what's ahead; something has happened, something beyond the powers and will and even imagination of the magicians: something wonderful."}

Better than the first one", "content": "In this second movie in the reboot of the original movies based on the old TV show, Captain James Tiberius Kirk of the Enterprise must face not only the renegade bad guy but also himself. Yes, I know, it's deep. Star Trek Into Darkness is, however, even better than its immediate predecessor, with spellbinding effects that actually look good in 3D, fleshed-out characterizations, and fine acting all around.\nIt's a year after the events in the first movie, and Kirk (Chris Pine) and company have been sent to a remote planet to observe and report. They discover that an active volcano is about to erupt, which would eradicate the indigenous society. Ignoring the Prime Directive, Kirk has Spock (Zachary Quinto) lowered into the volcano via shuttle and line to place and then detonate a nuclear device that would render the volcano inert. But, as they tend to do in ST films, things go wrong and Kirk has to reveal the hidden Enterprise to the society in order to rescue Spock. \nThat's just the leadup. At Starfleet HQ, Commander Pike (Bruce Greenwood) is livid. You see, Kirk's report terms the trip as \"uneventful\"; Spock's, however, details everything. The insubordination, the unwillingness to follow the rules, the hubris, and the lack of humility, all add up to Kirk's being stripped of command and demoted, with Spock to be transferred. However, an emergency meeting of top Starfleet brass is convened to discuss the recent bombing of a Starfleet building that housed archives. The meeting itself is attacked by a former Starfleet agent named John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), who then flees to an uninhabited part of the distant Klingon homeworld of Kronos. The Enterprise, with Kirk at the helm - but minus Scotty - takes off after Harrison, armed with 72 long-range missiles; the idea is to park just outside Klingon space, aim the torpedoes at Harrison, and fire away. But things...well, you know the drill. Things ain't what they seem to be.\nThere are plot revelations in this movie in almost every other scene, and certainly I won't go into them here. They all made sense (save for one, which seemed more like a red herring than anything else). But one point you should know going into this movie: a man without peace may desire war, the best way to gain power.\nElements of some of the original films are in play here. I think this rebooting is better than, say, redoing the Batman or Superman sagas every so often, because director J.J. Abrams simply grabs some plot points from various iterations of the series and inserts them at rational points. There is a feeling of real progression, that the crew grows with each mission, especially Kirk himself. Their transformations are sometimes excellent foreshadowing and sometimes elegant and subtle.\nI also feel that the actors playing the crew members are growing into their roles, growing together as a cohesive unit. We no longer see one person doing one job, incapable of helping; they are a team much more like the The Next Generation gang was, less like The Original Series.\nThe acting ranges from adequate to fantastic. Loved Pine and Quinto, who have several difficult, emotional scenes; loved Zoe Saldana as Lt. Uhura, Anton Yelchin as Ensign Chekov, Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy, John Cho as Lt. Sulu, and especially Simon Pegg as Lt. Cmdr. Scotty. None is a liability; all seem well cast and developed. In fact, we o get to know a little more about Uhura, Spock, and Scotty, and I suspect in future ST films we'll get more backstory as needed.\nStar Trek Into Darkness does contain quite a bit of dazzling effects, and it might be best seen in 3D. Even in 2D, it would be a spectacle to watch. It's one of those rare films that combines visual wizardry with an actual compelling plot and multidimensional characters.\nIt is possible that real Trek fans will be displeased with the movie. Some may have wanted a replica of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Some may have wanted a completely original story. The writers and director knew very well that they couldn't possibly please all mega fans, so they boldly chose a third path. The movie is, above all, a believable entry that is both faithful and original to the Trek universe."}

Guns, robots, robot suits, self-healing people who can regrow limbs, you know, the usual stuff.\nThe new villain to enter the world of Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) is The Mandarin, a mysterious, disheveled terrorist who's supposed to bear quite the resemblance to Osama bin Laden (although bin Laden himself is referenced in the movie). The Mandarin orchestrates several attacks on the US, but, tellingly, the explosions leave no trace of actual bomb. The Mandarin terms these attacks as lessons for the American people, and as they escalate in stature a nation turns its lonely eyes to Mr. Tony Stark, who's still trying to mentally process the events of The Avengers.\nYou might remember that in The Avengers, Iron Man temporarily sacrificed himself to save Earth by traveling through a worm hole and fighting off alien bad guys alongside Captain America, The Hulk, and Thor. For a man who up until that point was essentially a playboy who settled the occasional revenge/grievance, Stark has a lot to go through. Now he suffers from horrific insomnia (72 hours awake!) and night terrors. His place in the universe has been forever altered, and so has he psychologically. So he ensconces himself within his laboratory/basement and works on Iron Man suits to his heart's content, forty-something, actually, each one with different capabilities, each designed to defend the Earth against, well, anything.\nBut this has made for a brooding superhero. He can't sleep, so he does what he does best - build - to the eternal chagrin of his love, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), who's now head of Stark Industries (well, High Up, anyway). Tony's behavior both frightens and confuses her, and now this business with The Mandarin - will Iron Man get sucked into another adventure?\nHere's how this movie differs from its predecessors. We no longer see only the invulnerable, cocky, risk-taking Stark. This new Tony is much more like Batman, looking for a way to escape from his demons and not even knowing what those demons are. He suffers panic attacks and seems on the verge of a nervous breakdown. This makes for a much more evolved, shall we say, superhero. It ain't just about him anymore, or about Pepper. It's about the life, the universe, and everything. And his mortality shows, like the slip of a woman who's dressed hurriedly, and he doesn't like it one bit.\nI saw this movie in 3D. It's worth it, doesn't seem forced. I didn't bother with the IMAX, because I don't really need to be that immersed in a comic-book movie, but your mileage may vary. As far as I was concerned, the 3D was more than enough. \nStark makes copious use of his technology, but there comes a time in the film when he has basically nothing with which to work. I'm talking no suit, no JARVIS, no Pepper, no lab, no nothing. He has to rely on his intelligence and creativity and resourcefulness - the very same traits that got him out of that cave in the first Iron Man movie. It's not an altogether pain-free experience.\nDon Cheadle returns as Rhodes, whom the government puts in the War Machine suit from Iron Man 2, repainted in red, white, and yes blue, sort of a nod to ol' Captain America, called Iron Patriot. Nifty, and it reminded me of the early part of the Captain America movie, in which Cap essentially has to sell out and perform as a sideshow act for the troops, to keep up morale. With a Good Guy robot on their side, the government is pleased - until...well, this is truly not a spoiler, but a resident baddie finds a way to control Rhodes' suit, and we next have a subplot regarding the abduction of the president and the true identity of The Mandarin (guess what - Stark's past is involved).\nNow, those who are avid followers of the comic books may well be unhappy with some changes. Deal with it. The movie is not in a different dimension from its cinematic ancestors, and that's really the correct comparison. Some minor characters may have changed a little from the comics. Does it mean the movie suffers? Of course not.\nThere was a lot more humility than I'd come to expect from these movies, more humanity, more fear of mortality. That injection of reality, following so close behind the tragedies within The Avengers, makes this a very good genre movie. Yes, there are surprises, and yes, there are moments when your heart skips a beat, and yes, there are truly beautiful moments. But in all, this is a high-energy, hyperactive film that still manages to be philosophical and even regretful."}

At least if your parents are of a certain age, which is a polite way of saying they were in college in the 1960s, when the world was fraught with wars at home and abroad, physical and psychological wars, wars waged with peace and wars waged with violence. Robert Redford's The Company You Keep flashes back to a time that unfortunately feels just as real to the youth of today - violence begetting violence in the name of stopping violence, a seemingly unending circle. The movie's poignant, snappy, and full of panache as Redford, who also stars, is surrounded by an astounding cast that's full of Oscar nominees.\nDuring the worst years of America's involvement in the Vietnam War, there were certain protest factions in the country, mainly based on college campuses. These organizations represented the peace movement. They practiced nonviolence: marches, sit-ins, speeches. But when that diplomatic approach didn't end the conflict overseas, some members splintered off into groups that would use violent means to get the attention of the powers that be. One peace group was the SDS (Students for a Democratic Society); its militant spin off - which fractured both relationships and ideals - became the Weather Underground. And that is where the story begins. \nIt seems that members of the SDS pulled off a bank robbery - you know, to stick it to The Man - in which a bank guard was killed. Everyone in the SDS, including those involved in the violent side of things - went on the run for 30 years. Most took on new lives, new identities. Some kept their old lives, believing they were sticking to their convictions. Either way, they were all wanted people. Until one day when housewife Sharon Solarz (Susan Sarandon) turns herself in to the FBI, setting in motion a chain of events that quickly points to Jim Grant (Redford), a single, well-off dad. Is Jim Grant really one of the Weathermen? Journalist Ben Shepard (Shia LaBeouf) exposes Grant's true identity - not a spoiler - and the FBI is quickly on his tail, since the man formerly known as Nick Sloan is among those wanted for the guard's murder.\nNow, this may sound like another one of those man-on-the-run-to-prove- his-innocence movies, but it's not quite that simple. It's true that certain elements in the movie appear in similar films, but there isn't an insincere, forced scene to be found. In fact, it's tough for the audience to know what's really on Nick's mind. We get the idea that he was not involved in the killing - hey, the audience needs someone to root for, right? - but Nick isn't acting like he's running away. He's acting like he's looking for something. Or someone.\nWhat a cast! Sarandon has just a couple of scenes, but an extended bit with her talking to LaBeouf's reporter is intense and mesmerizing. Chris Cooper plays Nick's younger brother; Brendan Gleeson is a retired police chief. Stanley Tucci is Shepard's editor. Nick Nolte, Sam Elliott, Richard Jenkins, and Julie Christie are the present-day versions of the former activists. The sharply written script (by Lem Dobbs, based on Neil Gordon's book) doesn't shy away from tough questions. Many would be spoilers of some sort, so here's a benign one: how does one reconcile being against The Man and society and then, by virtue of experiencing life, becoming The Man and a contributing part of society? It seems nearly everyone has a different answer to that question.\nAnd what about LaBeouf? His Shepard is really the driving force behind everything. He outs Nick and pursues the story, as any intrepid reporter would. He calls in favors, he does research, he acts the part, much as Redford himself did in All the President's Men. But LaBeouf is no Redford. He's really in over his head here, the only miscasting in a film full of remarkable, memorable characters. I'm not sure what Redford saw in LaBeouf, but for my money someone like Joseph Gordon-Levitt would have been a much, much better choice, an actor with serious chops. LaBeouf's best work came alongside giant robots, and even then he was outacted. \nI'm nitpicking. I just ignored the whole Shepard-on-the-case thing and focused on Nick and his reasoning. Where was he running to? What did he need after all this time? What could possibly clear his name after 30 years? I like not knowing things in advance; it's a little idiosyncrasy of mine. I was just happy to be along for the ride, watching some of the best actors work their skills with master craftsmanship.\nThis might be a movie that would be award worthy, were this award season. Alas, it's not, and most people will have long forgotten it by next January. But it's a great movie, and it makes me wish Redford would be in front of the camera more often. Or even behind it. More Bob, is what I'm saying. I think it's safe to say his career's wound up better than his costar from All the President's Men, Warren Beatty, who's been out of movies for a decade. So go see The Company You Keep when you can; it's not a blockbuster, so it won't be in theaters for long."}

Wreck-It Ralph is a wonderful little film that combines smart dialog, brilliant animation varieties, and an abundance of familiar video-game characters - even to those who don't play games on a regular basis.\nRalph (voice by the underrated John C. Reilly) has one job - wreck an apartment building. When a kid puts a quarter into the machine's slot. Ralph shouts his catch phrase and then climbs the building (he's quite large), destroying windows, bricks, the whole nine yards, until the hero of the game, Fix-It Felix (voice of Jack McBrayer) arrives to save the day (with the help of the human player). The game is sort of a combination of Donkey Kong (helpful handyman) and Rampage, a game in which huge monsters scaled skyscrapers just to destroy them.\nAnyway, Ralph has a quandary. While the rest of game's characters live in the fancy building within the game, he lives in a literal pile of bricks and dreams of something more. And when he notices that Felix is throwing a party celebrating the game's 30th anniversary without inviting Ralph...well, Ralph doesn't much appreciate that and vows to win a medal, any medal, in order to convince the building's occupants that he's not as bad as everyone thinks.\nThis leads Ralph to jump into other games, a tactic that's forbidden. He winds up in a first-person shooter game much like Call of Duty, sneaking in as a foot soldier, and manages to grab a medal. Long story short (ha), this sort of screws up that game for the human player, and the main character of said war game has to track Ralph down among the other games in the arcade, because she realizes something else has left the game with Ralph.\nRalph winds up in a game that's a mixture of Mario Kart and Candyland. Actually sounds like fun, doesn't it? He meets Vanellope (voice of Sarah Silverman), who's a glitch, an error in the game's code that would be more trouble to remove than leave in, so in she stays. Vannelope manages to get Ralph's precious medal but promises to give it back if he'll help her build a racecar so she can win the game's race. Well, the race within the game. Still with me? Vannelope is an outcast as a glitch, so she has quite a bit to prove. Ralph, of course, will help her, even though she's a smart-aleck little brat. \nIs there more to all of this than meets the eye? Sure! Will it go over most kids' heads? No! Is it still enjoyable for physically grown-up people? Heck yes! Sure, this is a Disney film, so Lessons will be Learned, but there's so much eye-candy - uh, literally - that the message is not heavy handed in the least. And what is that message? Nonspoiler alert - it might be that Ralph does have what it takes to be a Good Guy after all. \nI loved how there were so many different characters from different game systems (Nintendo, XBox, arcade-only, Sega, you name it); the Bad Guy support group includes one of the ghosts from Pac-Man, Bowser from the Mario games, M. Bison from Street Fighter, one of the guys from Mortal Kombat, and so on. Each is drawn in his own original style. Same for the various good guys who make cameos in the movie, like Sonic the Hedgehog, and Pac-Man himself. The blending of art styles is impeccable and spectacular. I'm also a fan of quick wit, and Silverman can quick-wit with the best of them, particularly when matched against a slow-witted character like Ralph. Oh, and did I mention the Candy King? Yeah, he runs things in that candy racecar game, and he's voiced by Alan Tudyk (Firefly) with an accent right out of old Hanna-Barbera films. Priceless.\nIs Wreck-It Ralph a great film? Not exactly, but it's hard to find a comparable movie. Other Disney movies have their own style, as do the Disney/Pixar films. This one is a stand-alone treat, exhilarating for kids of all ages, especially those who grew up playing that old 8-bit NES. Or those of us who were stuck with the Atari 2600. Or those who spent hours and hours in actual arcades, fighting space invaders and helping a dumb frog cross a freeway. And even if you've never once picked up a game controller, you'll appreciate the humor, the voice delivery, the story, and the message."}

He comes to realize he's just a simple pawn, that he's been set up. He is, at times, on the run from those who had employed him. If you guessed that maybe this was a Tom Cruise movie, you'd be right. Poor old Tom is always getting set up and having to figure out what's what. But, like his earlier Minority Report, Cruise's latest sci-fi is a lot of fun, beautifully shot and tightly plotted.\nIt's the future, sometime, I forget when. Giant bugs invaded Earth. We kicked their butts with nukes, thus rendering almost the entire planet unlivable. Those who survived the war were shuttled off to eventually settle on Jupiter's moon Titan. Meanwhile, drones are set up in low Earth orbit to monitor and destroy any surviving bad guys, known as Scavs. You know, short for scavengers. Nothing grows. It's a big ol' wasteland, this planet. \nJack Harper (Cruise) is a soldier who has the task of being the clean-up crew; he and his colleague Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are in charge of monitoring the drones and the extraction machines that are removing water from Earth's surface to bring it to a huge space station called the Tet, humanity's escape vessel. All Jack has to do each day is check on the drones, fly around in a funny looking ship, and blast away the occasional Scav while ensuring that the rigs gulping down the water are still operational. \nThe Earth at this point is divided into at least two zones: inhabitable (kind of) and radioactive. The rigs are working in the former area, trying to squeeze all they can out of the planet before Jack and Victoria have to head up to the Tet - in two weeks' time. \nBut something funny is going on, down there on Earth. A simple recon mission to check out a rig leads Jack to believe he's not alone down there, and the truth - well, the first truth is shocking enough to him (he's been there a long time, though he has almost no memory of a time before the War), and the second is a stunner to the nth degree. \nCertainly, to give more information would spoil the film for you. I was pleasantly surprised to find a Tom Cruise movie in which there was a surprise of some sort. And his acting was better than usual, too - he's human, not a cardboard monkey playing dress up. When confronted with the truth, he's as befuddled as we are, which is unusual for a Tom Cruise character; they typically Know It All and Save the Day. Not so sure that's the case here.\nHis Jack also shows quite a bit of depth. We get glimpses of his past, through his own fractured memories. He can't shake them. He dreams about things that seem familiar and yet unknowable. He is introspective and cocky. He is daring, yet unsure. He is human.\nMorgan Freeman shows up in a role that cannot be explicated here except to say that he's Morgan Freeman. Melissa Leo is Sally, the commander of the Tet who checks in with Jack and Victoria every day to see how those rigs are a-comin' along (Southern accent). Both are excellent as always.\nI came away from Oblivion with a strong sense of satisfaction. The ending feels right; it's not contrived, it's not forced, it's not really Hollywood. That's not to say this isn't a feel-good movie, because in many ways it is. Just not the way you'd expect from the beginning of the film."}

Eh, it barely landed on him. He'll be fine, at least much better than the movie itself. Killing Them Softly is another hit man movie but without all that back-stabbing and double-crossing nonsense. No, this is simply about revenge. You'd think Pitt could melt into the movie pretty easily as a rough gun for hire, but he seems to have approached this role much like he did for True Romance: lazily laying on a couch with the munchies.\nA young scumbag, who works for an older scumbag, decide to take on a third, even-shiftier scumbag to knock over a Mob-operated poker game that's overseen by a corrupt cop, played by Ray Liotta. They come to this decision because Liotta had already done it, selling out his Mob overlords, and got away with it - but not without some suspicion. So the logic followed that were this incident to occur again, why, it'd be ol' Ray Liotta taking the blame.\nAfter the robbery takes place - Liotta's present, but it's clear the mobsters around him think something different is afoot. That's where Pitt comes in. He's hired to track down the miscreants and their ringleader and shoot them dead where they stand. The title refers to Pitt's method of killing - from a distance, both physically and emotionally. He doesn't want to know their sob story, he doesn't want to see any crying, and he doesn't want any begging. So he shoots from a distance. But that's the funny thing, see? Of all the people shot to death in this movie by one Brad Pitt, all are pretty dang close up except for one - whom Pitt finishes off at close range. So much for that tenuous connection to the title, eh?\nAnyway, Pitt's character does an awful lot of detective work for a gunsel, just to find two teenagers and an old man. But yeah, no spoiler, they get found. I think what bothered me about the movie was how truly low key Pitt is in the movie. Why was he cast? I don't mean he needs to be all-out Brad Pitt, Movie Star, but he - and the rest of the movie, except for a resurgent Liotta - were languid to the point of disinterest in making anything resembling a special film.\nThis seems like a movie that should have stayed a book (it's based on the novel Cogan's Trade, named for Pitt's character), a book that would have a long-running series, a la Spenser or any number of gumshoes/shady characters. But as a movie, there's just not enough of anything: excitement, wit, eccentricities, you name it."}

I mean, it has fun performances, and lots of shooting and blood and guts and whatnot, but essentially it's just another Big Ol' Action Movie about spies and double crossing and plans gone awry. It'll be a decent rental for an escapist evening.\nJason Statham and Robert DeNiro play superspies who jump around the world, stopping bad guys and so forth. After almost killing a small child in the line of duty, Statham retires - sure he does - and that's that, as he retreats to Australia and meets cute with a local. A year later, he gets a package containing a picture of DeNiro holding a sign to the effect that if Statham doesn't come rescue him, DeNiro will be killed. What's Statham gonna do? I have no idea, no fathomable idea.\nTurns out a sheikh wants to hire Statham to avenge the murders of his three sons. He has a fourth, but he wants that one to take over the family biz, which I think we can assume involves oil. Whatever it is, the man's rich, and The Stath has no choice. He takes the job, assembles a small team, and gets to work.\nNow, I'm not going to pretend that this is a nuanced film, unless you think nuanced is a synonym for convoluted - in which case I'll happily pretend. Heck, there are hardly any betrayals, if you can believe that, in a spy movie. In any event, everything is simultaneously not what it seems and exactly what it seems; that is, if there is a surprise, you've expected it. Yes, that's a paradox, or at least it would be if the movie had more than one layer to it.\nAmong the bad guys is Clive Owen, the third star of the film. From the poster I thought he was teaming up with DeNiro and Statham, but no, not only is he the bad guy he doesn't even show up until well into the film, with a really, really cheesy mustache. He looks kind of silly. \nAs for the other two...well, Statham plays the same character he plays in every other Statham movie. He has a five o'clock shadow at all times, even as other characters' beards grow or faces become unshaven. His expression hardly ever changes. He is tender with his gal pal in Aussie land, but that's about it. Otherwise, straightforward, shoot-things Statham. DeNiro is much better than the material, and I'm glad to see he still has the moxie to shoot these violent films and make it look good. He's a pro, and even though he slips into stupid comedies from time to time, he'll always be one of the best actors of any generation. His performance helps edge the movie up a notch or two."}

It's a flight of fancy marked with darkness and tense, scary situations. It's glorious to watch for the visual effects alone, and director Sam Raimi makes great use of 3D (for a change). The story is as straightforward as it was in 1939, and the characters, although not quite as beloved, are a memorable lot.\nIt's Kansas, 1905, and Oz the Magician works with a traveling circus. He's not the best at his craft, but he makes do. Then a tornado arrives, he jumps into a hot air balloon, and off he goes, hither and yon, thither and whither, arriving in a very odd place. He's met at a river's bank by a beautiful young lady, Theodora (Mila Kunis), who soon discloses she's a witch. (But apparently not a bad one.) Theodora explains that it has been prophesied that a great wizard from a far-off land will arrive and restore the Land of Oz to prosperity, following the death of the king, who, she says, was poisoned by his own daughter, the Wicked Witch.\nNow, Oz is no wizard. He knows this, but man is that Theodora fetching, so he goes along with it. Then he gets to the palace, where - should he break the Wicked Witch's wand and thus kill her - he'll sit as king of Oz, and he's awed, even more so by the immense riches in the palace's basement. So he happily agrees to undertake the quest, accompanied only by a talking, flying monkey (Zach Braff).\nThe visual effects are stunning. I'm definitely not a fan of 3D, but here Raimi makes ample and appropriate use of the medium. One of Avatar's good points was the feeling of immersion, that objects were floating toward you, not a feeling of depth, with objects in the distance seen as if they were truly in front of you. In Oz the Great and Powerful, 3D is not abused. It pops up when it should, when it makes sense, and that's all you can ask from it. \nYes, the movie has munchkins - happily, none committed suicide during filming - and a Horse of a Different Color, if you look closely; mostly, it's a backstory to both our favorite Wicked Witch and Oz himself. It's premise is simple - Oz, a generally selfish con man with a tint of greed to his pallor, finds himself in a situation where he must choose to aid those in need. Or not. He is no wizard, yes, but he is a magician and does possess some, er, tricks up his sleeve. It is possible he is the man the witches are looking for.\nThe cast is game, with Kunis and Williams particular standouts. They're both elegantly clothed (must have been Opposite Day in Witchland) and look positively ethereal, particularly Williams, whom I don't believe I've ever seen look so luminous. \nIn all, Oz the Great and Powerful is a terrific film, probably the first true blockbuster of the year. It maintains the wonder and tone of the '39 megaclassic without messing around with the characters. It serves well as a prequel."}

His is a family company, with his daughter Brooke (Brit Marling of Another Earth) and son in full employment. His wife Ellen (Susan Sarandon) runs the various charities to which the company donates as well.\nNow, this being Richard Gere and his character being a finance guy, you can expect a lot of hubris from a man supposedly in charge of his life. He's juggling many things, abstract and concrete, and those who notice the line between legality and not is being trod upon are wise enough to look away. That is, until something unspeakable - and really only tangentially related to his business - happens because of the (in)action of Gere's Robert Miller. Then things do a 180-degree turn for the worst as he tries to put out fires large and small.\nI have no problem with characters who seemingly teeter on the edge between complete control and utter hopelessness, but how many times have we seen Gere in this sort of situation? If there was ever a role model for any kind of slick character, it'd be Richard Gere. It's not as if he turns in a poor performance here, it's just that he offers up no surprises, almost sleepwalking through an all-too-familiar role.\nDespite that, the intrigue of the various conflicts - no, you won't get me to give any away, but some deal with the company and some with the family - was compelling stuff. You truly don't know how things are going to wind up for the guy, which is a good thing. Then again, there's a good chance you won't be satisfied with the ending. Does Robert deserve his fate? He probably deserves something, especially as he digs his own hole deeper and deeper. It's a little tough to feel sympathy for the guy.\nOn the upside, he does get excellent support from Sarandon, Marling, and Tim Roth as a detective; not only that, there are frequent mentions to what will happen to the shareholders who depend on Robert should he make a misstep. Kind of a switch from the movies in which shareholders are just tools for the magnate.\nOverall, Arbitrage covers familiar territory with the right man for the job - since he's done it before. There are some bright spots, but the film is unsatisfying, from minicrisis to maxicrisis. It's certainly not a feel-good movie."}

It's a beautiful look at hope in lieu of utter hopelessness, at romance in lieu of disappointment, and at life instead of, well, not really having one. I truly loved this movie, loved it to pieces, and I think it's one you'll enjoy as well.\nIt all starts with a mysterious ad placed in a Seattle newspaper asking for an assistant to do a little, you know, time traveling. The respondent must bring his or her own weapons. The ad-placer has done this only once before. The title is invoked. The staff at a local magazine are intrigued, mainly because they have no better ideas - is this the work of a nut job, or what? Writer Jeff (Jake Johnson) offers it as a story idea and brings along interns Darius (Aubrey Plaza) and Arnau (Karan Soni). Jeff figures they'll interview the guy, and it'll make for a nice, kooky feature. Win-win for all.\nKenneth (Mark Duplass, who also coproduced), though, immediately sniffs out Jeff as someone who doesn't remotely believe his story and kicks him off his porch. Enter Darius, a loner, perhaps virginal, definitely lacking in self confidence, definitely still mourning the death of her mother. She's in this because she desperately needs a change. She is in a funk. She befriends Kenneth, who is convinced that agents of some sort are out to get him - or are they? You and I would probably think that Kenneth's a wee paranoid. What if he's not? Darius sets out to meet Kenneth's qualifications (no, not sexual), helping him obtain materials for his, uh, machine (which she isn't permitted to see). The two grow a little close. Doubt creeps in about Kennth's sanity.\nMeanwhile, there are two separate-but-equal story lines afloat. Jeff's real reason for traveling to this coastal town isn't the story - which he assumes Darius and Arnau will write - but to reconnect with an old flame, a flame from more than 20 years ago. It's a story that seems almost random in the overarching theme of the film. Arnau is along for something different, just like Darius, but his is more of a life quest than a career quest. He wants to experience life, not read about it, but he's too deep in his shell to do much about it. Enter Jeff. And like Jeff's story, Arnau's seems like it has little to do with the time- travel plot - and yet both smaller plots connect very deeply with each other and with the larger story.\nThroughout the movie, one is never really sure what Kenneth's motives are. Even if he's sane, why is he returning? He offers an explanation to Darius, but is it real? Is his machine real? He has put a lot of thought into his plans. There are no clues either way. We even see agents pursuing Kenneth - but are they out to get him because they don't want him to time travel, or is it something more, well, earthly? The mysteries are vortices of unending complexity.\nBut you know what really ties this movie together? It's the acting. Plaza is simply perfect as Darius. She's not a stereotype, not some self-absorbed emo chick with daddy issues. (Her dad, played by Jeff Garlin, is truly the understanding, perceptive type.) She's been emotionally bruised. She wants more but doesn't know how to get it. She's an endearing misfit, sad but defiant, wickedly intelligent, and creative. I spent the movie hoping Darius would get what she wanted, but we never really, really know what Darius wants, only what she says. I don't know how old Plaza is, but she looks like she's in her twenties but with the poise of someone in her forties. A tremendous performance, one that is complemented with equal amounts of grace and crudity by Johnson, Duplass, and Soni.\nSafety Not Guaranteed is simply a movie that must be seen to be fully appreciated. I mean, I could blather on and on about how awesome it is without giving away actual plot points - that's not easy! - but I'm telling you, this is a movie you should see. It is as intriguing as the classified ad that started it all."}

For half of the movie, it is a persuasive indictment of the pharmaceutical industry and its crass behavior toward its patients; for the other half, it is a three- cornered mystery/thriller, with double crosses and framings galore. It is fair to say that the movie is adequate during each of its disparate parts, but overall it's a convoluted story that immerses itself in faux intrigue and wraps itself up so neatly that you can practically see the bow on it. \nEmily (Rooney Mara) is a depressive; her husband Martin (Channing Tatum) has just returned from a stint in prison for insider trading, but she feels anxious and can't sleep. She visits psychiatrist Jonathan Banks (Jude Law), who prescribes a brand-new drug to help her out when the better-known brands (Zoloft, Paxil, Wellbutrin, etc.) don't seem to break Emily from her ennui. But the drug, as you might have guessed so expertly, does have its side effects.\nIt turns out - not a spoiler - that Emily has begun to sleepwalk. Well, more than sleepwalk, she does things in her sleep, like cook breakfast and set the table, all in the middle of the night and not remembering a thing the next day. Tragedy strikes while Emily sleeps. Is she the culprit, or is the drug to blame?\nAt first, the premise seems to be that involving patients in drugs that are just approved, as part of a study, is pretty unethical behavior by a doctor. Dr. Banks has bills to pay, though, what with his wife losing her high-powered job. So he's working longer hours and taking on more work, including participation in this study. When the tragedy that strikes comes back to haunt him as well as Emily, the movie takes a turn - it manages to turn Banks from being just an overextended shmoe into a manipulative drug dealer who uses his patients as experiments. Up until this point, we don't know whether Banks is actually innocent. From what we've seen, he seems so, but he could have inadvertently caused someone's death by prescribing medication to someone who reacted badly to the side effects. Naturally, his reputation (and marriage) in ruins, Banks works to clear his name. This is actually easier than it is in most movies of this ilk, because he's not in prison or anything. He just needs to piece together clues.\nOne of those clues is Emily's last doctor, Victoria Siebert (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who is helpful but guarded. She relates that Emily left her care in Connecticut when Emily's husband got a job on Wall Street, which ultimately led Emily to see Dr. Banks.\nThe second half of the movie deals with Banks' efforts to find things out. Racing against time and struggling to believe various stories, he is now in full-on victim mode as presented to the viewer. It's not an unusual role; in fact, it's sort of a trope, the innocent trying to prove themselves. We're now sold on his innocence, and we as the audience just want to know what's happened.\nI mentioned before that the movie ends rather neatly. Too neatly for my tastes, although it's not as if the explanations were implausible. But there's nothing wrong with some loose ends, some ambiguity, and this film - the 50th and final (maybe?) to be directed by Steven Soderbergh - leaves nothing ambiguous behind. We know, in full, the motives and fates of each character. Is this a good thing? Many won't be bothered by it, but for me I just prefer to have some questions left unanswered. \nLaw is adequate, although it feels like he's just stepping in for Tom Cruise when Cruise did all of those \"framed man on the run\" movies, like The Firm. Zeta-Jones is icy and opaque, two beneficial traits for her character. Mara, of course, steals the show, simply because of this: up until the last moments of the movie, we don't know whether anything about Emily is true. Instead of Law being the victim/accused, Mara's character slips quietly into that very role. In Emily, Mara brings the ambiguity the film needs - it's just too bad that ambiguity did not spread to the rest of the film. Shame; that would be a nice side effect indeed."}

It's not that it's not for the faint of heart - it's only PG-13, for goodness sake - it's that the scares are as psychological as they are visual. It's very well crafted, with an atypical ending and top-notch performances by a pair of young girls. It does dabble in some horror tropes and lapses in logic, but overall it's very successful at what it tries to be - a movie that burrows into your head to make you wonder what is coming next.\nVictoria (Megan Charpentier) and Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse) are two very young girls whose father suddenly comes home one day and takes them away - \"Mommy's sick\" - to an isolated cabin in the middle of a snowstorm, and then he's gone. Don't ask me how or why; it'll spoil things. This leaves the girls - aged three and one (!) to fend for themselves. They are found five years later, and after the quickest custody battle of all time, they are handed over to their Uncle Luke (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) and his rock-band girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain, seriously). To facilitate the handover, Dr. Dreyfuss, who has been studying the girls, sets them all up in a nice new house, the better to get unfettered access to them. After all, they've been feral for five years. Young Lilly almost never walks upright. Victoria retains some memories of life before losing her mom and dad, but even she harbors some very dark secrets - after all, who's been feeding the girls all this time?\nShortly into the movie, Luke is incapacitated and endures a hospital stay, while Annabel - who had been considering leaving him - is stuck with two very unorthodox sisters with a mysterious past. Maybe some nurturing is in order, but it doesn't seem to be rocker Annabel's thing. Even so, she loves Luke enough to give it a go until he can return home. That's when all hell breaks loose. You see, readers, it seems something has followed the girls from that lone cabin in the woods, something that had been protecting it, something that sees Luke and Annabel as intruders, not helpers. Something...well, something not good. Things happen in the house that prove to be very unsettling to Annabel; the girls seem to have a new, unseen playmate but remain mostly incommunicado. It's not quite Amityville Horror-level, with bleeding walls and such, but it's not a relaxing environment. Only Lilly seems at ease; Annabel knows something is up but has no idea what's in store for her, and Victoria is caught in the middle, having known a life before the abandonment.\nOne of the treasures of this movie is in piecing together what's happened to launch all events into motion. Why did the dad take the girls away? Where is the mom? You have to listen closely to news reports - which usually feel like nothing more than background noise - to learn the truth. \nOne side note about Chastain - she is virtually unrecognizable. Gone is the flowing red hair. She looks more like Courtney Cox in the Scream movies. She does fine with the material she has to work with, in fact a bit better.\nIt's a dark, dark movie, Mama is. Who is Mama? Is it the girls' mother, not really dead? Is it her ghost? Is it someone else? Is it no one else - an imaginary friend created by the girls to cope with living alone? It takes the adults in the movie about as long to figure it out as it will take the average viewer, and that's a good thing. Motives are not always obvious, and research - by Dreyfuss - is undertaken. This movie manages to pull off the trick of including a scary demon/ghost/whatever without showing her too fully (as in bright light or even fully formed). There are just enough unanswered questions - too many, and it's a flawed film, and too few and it's an overly neat film. And even though we can all guess where all roads lead in a geographic sense, the ending is a solid, plausible, emotional surprise."}

Instead of fleeing when a massive storm approaches, the duo (along with other residents) remain to pick up the pieces of their now flooded lives in Benh Zeitlin's tremendous Beasts of the Southern Wild. It's a movie about passion and love and survival, about dreams and coping. It is anchored by an Oscar-nominated performance by young Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis, around whom the movie centers and who serves as the film's voice. \nHush Puppy (Wallis) is but six years old. Her mother is gone (her dad tells her that mom went into the water and swam away), so she lives with her daddy, Wink (Dwight Henry), who has a quick temper and poor, declining health. Hush Puppy and the local denizens live in what is essentially squalor (she and her daddy live in different \"houses\"), but everyone seems to feel they are better off where they are, estranged from the so-called civilized world, than to be a part of it. In their affectionately named Bathtub, the community looks out for one another and finds joy in almost everything.\nA storm approaches. It is meant to be analogous to Katrina, I believe, although the name is not mentioned. Authorities arrive and institute a mandatory evacuation. A few, including Hush Puppy and Wink, stay behind anyway, unafraid of the storm. They spend the night in their bathtub/boat, sheltered from the elements. When the morning comes, the water has risen dramatically.\nThis is not a story about people banding together to survive; frankly, it's a hard movie to really pin down. It has mythical properties that blur the line between reality and the imagination. The community's teacher, Miss Bathsheba (Gina Montana) explains to the little children that the polar ice caps are melting, which is causing more water to head southward, and that someday The Bathtub and all around it will either be underwater or bespoiled by the salt within the water, that all will die. She also notes to her impressionable crew that the melting will free ancient beasts called aurochs from their ice prisons, and said creatures will roam the earth to dine on humans and such. Miss Bathsheba is not an optimist, unlike Wink and Hush Puppy.\nThere is severe conflict between father and daughter. Wink apparently wants to do right by his young charge, left alone to look after her, but he is a drunk, and an abusive one at that. When he does reappear, he is even angrier and more frustrated, and he brushes off all questions from his young daughter. It quickly becomes clear that Wink is even sicker than he first appeared.\nMan versus self, man versus nature, man versus man (child), man versus man (government). Narrated by Hush Puppy, the movie takes us directly into her life, a life of a girl untethered by the experience of adults. She worries about her daddy, especially when he scares her, but deep down she believes, very strongly, that her daddy will always protect her.\nThe movie's reality angle - the big storm - is neatly intertwined with the tale of the approaching aurochs; are they real, or do they reside in Hush Puppy's dreams? Zeitlin's expert hand enables us to believe that both are possible. She dreams of them, informed by her teacher, and they exist, informed by nature's encroachment on The Bathtub. The spectacle of the mighty, enormous aurochs, shot by Ben Richardson (who won a Sundance Award for his work here), is unforgettable, and it's just one of many in this powerful, thoughtful, emotional film.\nWallis is its anchor. It's a lot to ask of a girl who was only five when she shot her scenes, to carry an entire movie centered around her thoughts, but she is so spectacularly perfect, so heart wrenching, so - yes - lovable. Her childlike wonder is no act, since she is indeed a child - and an inexperienced actor as well - but it is nevertheless compelling, beautiful work. She is well deserving of her nomination, the youngest-ever Best Actress nominee."}

Although it follows a tried-and-true formula, this is a film worth watching with your wee ones - or even by yourself. Sure, you can write it off as another eco-fascist brainwash experiment, but you'd be wrong to do that. Yes, this film has a message - save the trees, save yourselves - but it's whimsical, mirthful fun, too.\nTed (Zac Efron) is a young denizen in a city that's completely devoid of plant life, including dirt. Oh, there are flowers and shrubs, but they're plastic. And the big commodity that everyone buys isn't bottled water, it's bottled air. Because there are no plants to photosynthesize, you see. Ted has eyes for a beautiful-and-approachable Audrey (Taylor Swift), who confides to Ted that the one thing she wants in the whole world is, of all things, a tree. She's apparently read about them. Eager to impress, Ted asks his mother, who thinks the idea of dirty, smelly plants is just hideous, but Ted's Grammy (Betty White) knows where to find the tree - Ted must venture outside of the walled city and seek out the Once-ler.\nWhen we do meet the Once-ler, we learn why he is alone in a ramshackle home and why there are no trees around him, just stumps, as he relates his fantastic tale to Ted over the course of a few days. A few days is enough for the head honcho in town, Mr. O'Hare (Rob Riggle) learns of Ted's exploits and tries to strong-arm him out of visiting the Once-ler. Well, this is a kids' movie, so you can guess how that goes.\nThe Once-ler relates that he had set out to seek his fortune despite the lack of support from his family. He was convinced that there was a plant material out in the world that was so soft and capable of so many uses that if he could find it and harvest it, why, he'd be a success. He finds a huge forest of trees and chops one down, and then and there is when and where we meet The Lorax (Danny DeVito) himself. The Lorax explains that cutting down the trees is a bad, bad thing, that all of the creatures living in and around them would suffer great harm if the trees were to vanish. The Once-ler agrees to cut down but the one tree, but as you can guess, when he gets the leaves, woven into a Seussian fabric, back to town, they're a hit. And there go the Once-ler's principles. He breaks his deal.\nThe dynamics and plot of the movie are not unlike Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs - crazy inventor whom no one believes in does invent something useful, but at a cost - but it's the whimsy, straight from the imagination of the Good Doctor himself, that make this one a little more entertaining. It's a completely animated film - no live-action junk here, that's for sure - and the settings are direct from the pages of the book itself. Seuss's world is imaginatively realized by directors Chris Renaud and Kyle Balda, not to mention a top-flight animation crew at Universal Pictures (really). \nIf you're wondering whether to take your tyke to this movie, don't wonder. Of course you should. It's a fun movie that even you - yes, you - will enjoy. It has all of the spirit of Dr. Seuss's books and the pretty animation to make it come alive. It's no top-flight Pixar/Disney/Dreamworks movie, but it's full of heart, passion, compassion, and true grit."}

It's an odd- duck movie in that the ending is never in doubt; only the path to the goal. The hunt for the most notorious terrorist of them all, Osama bin Laden, occurs over a ten-year period from the point of view of the Americans and, chiefly, the CIA operative running the operation. It is very compelling, riveting stuff. However, I don't feel that it is a great film; despite a remarkable performance by Jessica Chastain and solid camera work, the movie comes off at its worst as over-the-top jingoism masquerading as patriotism, making America look great to those who wave their arms at how Number One the good ol' USA is, the best of the best, and making America look terrible, perhaps, to those who are not American.\nThe movie is unflinching in its depiction of violent methods, but we should get one thing clear right away: it's a work of fiction based on true events. Just because something occurs in this film does not mean it happened in real life.\nThe film is difficult to watch for a couple of main reasons. For one, there is audio of phone calls from the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, and those alone may raise your hackles. Then there is the use of waterboarding and other forms of torture, and knowing that this sort of thing did go on after 2001 makes for some harrowing viewing. \nHere's an interesting comparison for you. Adolph Hitler was a genocidal maniac. When the war was closing in on him, he took his own life, thus depriving his enemies the same satisfaction. Bin Laden, however, did not; he continued to operate remotely, unseen except by the occasional video to al-Jazeera. His mere presence kept people angry, demanding action. Whereas Hitler's death definitively ended WW II, bin Laden's survival began a new one. What if bin Laden, who had been cooped up in the caves in Tora Bora, had killed himself? No war, perhaps, and no real satisfaction on the part of America and its comrades.\nMaya (Chastain) is a neophyte operative when she begins the search for bin Laden. She needs to fight bureaucracy and lack of good leads; she travels from Langley (CIA headquarters) to Yemen to Pakistan to Afghanistan and on and on, surviving only on her zeal to capture the fugitive. We're never really told why this all means so much to her, after a decade of work. Is it personal, or is just for the sake of country? Somehow, if it is the latter, one gets the feeling that move has been played out in so many other movies - we must get our man. But perhaps her motivation is immaterial. Since we know so little about our main character - just that she is a loner with apparently no friends or family - the main thread is simply Finding bin Laden. Simple and to the point.\nSo. If we remove the relative recency of 9/11/2001 from the equation, this is simply another action movie. Lots of explosions, Navy SEALS, blood and guts, political intrigue, and so on. But we can't remove that from the equation, can we? Many of us were alive and kicking in 2001 and remember this all too well, so it's a little different from watching an old Hollywood movie about the Second World War.\nIt is implied, very subtly, that information gleaned from detainees leads, obliquely, to the capture of bin Laden, but this was never the case. People say all kinds of crazy things under extreme duress. Again, I stress that this is fictitious based on true events; liberties have understandably been taken with plot elements.\nAs I was leaving the theater, I had some questions to face: Did I see what I expected? Well, I knew the ending, so yes, I suppose I did. But was it truly a great movie? I don't think so, no. I think it glorified - to the consternation of the US government itself - many aspects of our operations overseas that we'd rather not have glorified. The movie made us look great to the win-at-all-costs populace and look worse in the eyes of the international community. And, to be clear, this isn't a political statement, this review: President Bush is hardly mentioned, and when President Obama is shown on screen, he's declaring that America does not torture - while a room of CIA operatives who do just that watch, idly.\nZero Dark Thirty is a good film. Kathryn Bigelow's earlier The Hurt Locker was much more entertaining and better crafted; this one is not as well directed, as it feels like a cookie-cutter action/political thriller with a dash of topicality thrown in for spice."}

It features beautiful cinematography, even for those who don't particularly care about such things, and winning performances by Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt. Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, at its heart, is not a movie about fish at all; it is about different kinds of faith and the degree to which people place their trust in them. Alfred Jones (McGregor) is an expert in all things ichthyic and works for the UK's version of the Department of the Interior. He is approached by the representative of a idealistic sheikh who loves to fish. The sheikh has it in his head that bringing the art of fly fishing for salmon to the Yemen River would be beneficial to his people (the river is dried up in places and is, obviously, in the middle of a desert). It is not a popular idea, and Jones, before and after taking a perfunctory meeting with Harriet, dismisses it as ludicrous, unsound, and downright absurd. (Dr. Jones is a bit of a straight arrow, you see.) And it would seem that would be the end of it, except that the Prime Minister's press secretary (Kristin Scott Thomas) sees this as an opportunity to foster Arab-Anglo relations at a time when, well, they're not so good. Long story short \u2013 Jones has to make the project work.\nThere are many obstacles to overcome. The water must be the right temperature and with the right amount of oxygen. Fish have to be found, somewhere, and imported. Negotiations must be had with local tribes who feel that bringing water to the desert is an abomination of some sort. And meanwhile, pressure mounts and mounts for Jones to pull it all off, since the sheikh is paying handsomely to the British government.\nAlfred \u2013 Fred \u2013 and Harriet each have home lives that are in their own unique turmoil. Fred has been married for several years with no children, and it's clear that the love he and his wife once shared in full has dwindled considerably; she suddenly takes a job in Geneva, promising to visit him every so often. As for Harriet, the first man she has fallen for is suddenly deployed to Afghanistan. Each takes solace in their Yemen project.\nWhat works best in this movie is the chemistry between Blunt and McGregor; the former plays an optimist ready for new challenges, and the latter is more of a stick-in-the-mud with little sense of humor. Okay, you who are reading this know that this is a plain setup, as this is not just a drama: it a romantic drama. Luckily for all of us, the movie doesn't descend into double entendres, sideward glances, awkward silences, and the like. Blunt and McGregor manage to avoid making the romance too light, too believable; we shouldn't be able to easily guess precisely how things will wind up, and we can't. Theirs is a working relationship that neither acknowledges as being anything but, and each is torn between their subconscious feelings for each other and for their respective significant others.\nAt one point, the sheikh asks Jones if he is a man of faith, and the expert replies that he is not. The sheikh rightly points out, however, that fishing itself relies on faith \u2013 the hope that something will occur, however improbable. A man puts a lure into the water. The outcome is not predetermined; he will most likely reel it in untouched. But he has faith that a fish will nibble at it and take the bait. The sheikh feels the same way about his fishing project. He has faith that doing so will enable the poor communities surrounding the river to thrive.\nIn the end, this is a quiet, elegant movie about love and hope, both of fishing and humanity. Excellent performances by the leads and able direction by Hallstrom make this a sort of soft-edged drama with romance and a bit of action."}

Jack Black plays a solicitous, generous assistant funeral-home director in a small town who quickly gains the love and respect of the town, particularly the elderly folks, as he immerses himself into their lives. Black leaves the slapstick and crudity at home and instead goes the route of Ben Stiller in Greenburg, although not quite as dramatic, and he's really good in the role. In the end, though, one might wonder what the point of the movie was, and for a comedy - even a dark one - there are a lot of unanswered questions at film's end.\nBernie arrives in town and lucks upon a job at the local funeral parlor. He takes great care in making the deceased look as good as possible, from trimmed eyelashes to the positioning of the hands and head. Bernie takes his job seriously. He runs the funerals, leading the mourners in song, reading from the Bible, and so on; he comforts the widows and does all he can to ease their pain. He's a true find, right?\nOne of these old biddies is Mrs. Nugent (Shirley MacLaine), a despised, bitter older woman who has money and no friends whatsoever. All overtures to communicate and bond with Mrs.Nugent by the town are for naught. Except for Bernie, who - as his custom - pays his respects after the funeral to the new widow. After the second visit, she invites him in, and over some time they become friends. The change in Mrs. Nugent is remarkable; she is a nicer person and much happier. She and Bernie go on vacations and other trips together. Finally, she feels, someone who does not hate her.\nMrs. Nugent gets Bernie to quit his job at the funeral home and work for her part time - essentially as a servant. Seems like a sweet deal at first, but eventually she becomes paranoid that he'll leave her at any moment, and he becomes concerned that she's turning into quite the possessive witch. That, as the synopsis might tell you on other sites - this is not a spoiler - induces him to perform a most heinous deed.\nThe story is told in the framework of a documentary, with on-camera exposition provided by the town's denizens. Most are gossipy, but none of them stand out as mean-spirited - just normal folks, as they might say. About the only two characters who don't open up to the camera are Bernie and Mrs. Nugent themselves. This little trick by director Richard Linklater helps not only move the plot along but also serves us sometimes conflicting information, depending on the source - even when we see things with our own eyes.\nThe first half of the story is amusing, mostly about how wonderfully generous Bernie is to everyone. And then the crime occurs, and the various citizens react differently. But here's the rub - Bernie is such a magnificent guy, there are some who don't even care if he IS guilty. Star district attorney Danny Buck (Matthew McConaughey) has an open-and- shut case, complete with a confession. All that remains is the trial and the aftermath.\nThis is more of a character study - of Bernie alone - than anything else. It could have been played for sharp laughs or even as a suspenseful thriller. Linklater plays it more or less straight, essentially saying, \"Here's your man, here's what others think of him, what do you think?\" And indeed, what are we to think? There are some head-scratching questions by the end. Here's a non-spoiler one: Why was Bernie even in that town? Did he choose it randomly? Did he premeditate the events that unfolded? Okay, three questions, but all valid. None will ruin the movie for you. See it for Black and MacLaine and a realistic look at small-town Texans."}

Wes Anderson's quirky, stylish romantic comedy-drama is pleasant, with all the usual off-beat trappings. It is both tender and amusing and infinitely relatable for anyone who remembers being a preteen and wishing to escape.\nIn 1965, Jared Gilman plays Sam, a Scout member. He's disliked by the other boys, probably because of his over-sized glasses and overactive intellect. His scoutmaster is played by the redoubtable Edward Norton. One morning, when Sam does not show up for the camp's breakfast, Scoutmaster Ward discovers that the boy has left in the middle of the night. He calls in Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis), who canvasses the island and informs the Bishops (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand), just in case they see the boy. And soon thereafter, wouldn't you know it, but their rebellious daughter Suzy (Kara Hayward), is also missing. And so a manhunt is afoot.\nThe most delightful aspect of this movie is that it, like Stand by Me before it, feels as if it's viewed directly through the perspective of young kids. Some adults are nice, some are not. Other kids can be mean. You can count on yourself and few others. Both Suzy and Sam come from unorthodox homes with some measure of regiment, and through the power of being pen pals, decide on a complex plan of action.\nBut this isn't just a movie about two kids on the lam. It's about people discovering themselves, allowing themselves to be reborn as better scoutmasters, better parents, better cops. It's about young love's slow blossoming. It is not about physical intimacy. It's a genuine, honest, and deeply enchanting, colored in luxuriant blues and yellows and earth tones, peppered with the staccato speech of a scoutmaster and the angst of a police officer, and drenched in some terrific character acting. Hayward and Gilman are better than you would expect from neophytes; much, much better. Their pain, their loss, their love, their gain, their everything - we feel it all right there with them. \nIt helps that Anderson has assembled a top-notch cast, even if none of them really get a lot of screen time. Willis, McDormand, and an almost- unrecognizable Harvey Keitel are all standouts. The story moves lightning quick, pausing only to show us tender moments in stark contrast to the mad dash to find the fleeing duo. It's a given that we're to root for the kids, but the adults are by no means presented as evil-doers who wish to punish their offspring. This is a movie that teaches us by allowing us to relive our own childhoods and see the choices laid out before us. And, like any kind-hearted movie, it shows us that love is a shining thing.\nAlthough I enjoyed Anderson's whimsical atmosphere set against some fairly serious backgrounds, including children in danger and even blood, I liked this movie first and foremost because of the dead-on performances of Gilman and Hayward, two stars in the making. Their chemistry is palpable; they are simultaneously a mismatched couple and two meant to be together."}

It's about two uptight New Yorkers who, on the way to relocation in Georgia, spend a night at a bed and breakfast that doubles as a commune - and find out they like it. A lot. The movie features playful performances by Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd and is harmless fun.\nThe movie is written and directed by David Wain, he of Wet Hot American Summer, Children's Hospital, and The State fame, so you should know what you're getting - some gross-out stuff, some over-the-top stuff, and some stuff that doesn't quite work. Assisting him in his mayhem are former State-mates Ken Marino, Kerri Kenney, Joe Lo Truglio, Michael Ian Black, and Michael Showalter. Justin Theroux plays the ad hoc leader of the pack, a mellow man who believes it's still 1985 (apparently); Alan Alda is along as the last remaining founding member; Jordan Peele and Malin Akerman have small parts as well. On screen, that is.\nThe basic gist is this: George (Rudd) has just lost his job when the CEO is arrested for something or other, just as Linda (Aniston) fails to sell a documentary to HBO about penguins. They've just bought an apartment in the Upper West side of Manhattan. Now they have no income. Tails between legs, they drive from New York down to the hinterlands of Atlanta to stay with George's brother Rick (Marino). Along the way - thankfully, in montage form - they bicker and make up, bicker and make up. \nFinally, Linda says she just has to stop; they've driven enough. The nearest place to spend the night is Elysium, and yes, it's as hippie- like as its name implies. There's a nudist who's writing a book. They don't clap, they snap their fingers. Guitar is played. Games like \"truth telling\" are played. Weird roots are eaten. There are no doors inside the house, not even for the bathrooms. It's a quintessential commune, as far as I know. \nI think the motivation of a character is the key to a movie, and here motivation is what (no pun intended) drives the plot. First they leave, then they come back. How could they not? Oh, here's something else - the denizens of the group practice free love. I assume the communes of the sixties were exactly like this one. That's what literature's told me. \nAnyway, let's look at our characters. Both George and Linda vacillate, as you might expect them to, and not at the same time, as you'd also expect. What do they want out of life, anyway? They're not young. Sometimes staying with the oddballs sounds like fun and sensible; other times, returning to Life makes a heck of a better argument. Meanwhile, Theroux's Seth has the hots for Linda, and Akerman's Eva has the same for George. Awkward. Kenney is a laugh riot as a dotty matriarch who's about as offbeat and, frankly, crazed as her character on Reno 911!. Alda is grizzled and constantly seems to be reciting the names of the other, long-lost cofounders of the place. It's trippy.\nTo use a horrible clich\u00e9, Wanderlust is what it is - and nothing more. It doesn't pretend to be either an all-out slapstick or intelligent comedy. It's lighthearted, lacking in any serious mean streak (there's some obnoxious teasing on the part of brother Rick). It's an amiable, if slightly aimless, film. There are no twists to be wary of, no plot intricacies to keep track of. It's straightforward humor. You either go with it or don't, which is why it just misses the mark; the better comedies carry you along with them, either through rapid witty lines or pratfalls galore."}

He plans to do this by giving each a cover: together, they will represent a Canadian movie crew scouting Iran for filming locations for a Star Wars knockoff movie. The clincher? It all really happened.\nAt first, the students who took over the American embassy do not know that six of their captives are missing, which buys everyone some time. The CIA brainiacs try to figure out a way to extradite them to the US. Have them pose as teachers? There are no American teachers left in Iran - they'd be spotted. Have them escape via bicycle? It's winter, no one's riding a bike. How about as farmers? See above. There's snow in Iran. And then Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck, who also directed) gets the idea of getting the Americans out by way of Hollywood. \nTensions are extremely high. There is anti-American hatred in the streets of Tehran, and there's plenty of anti-Iranian sentiment in the U.S. as well. The students want to show the world that they mean business, but the U.S. doesn't negotiate with terrorists. Things don't look good, especially with the knowledge that inevitably someone will notice that six Americans are missing among the captured. Time is not on our side.\nSince the premise of the six Americans' cover is that of a Canadian film crew, there needs to be a script. And a producer, and a director. Mendez contacts John Chambers (John Goodman), a veteran makeup/costume artist, who brings in at-the-end-of-his-career Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin). They find a script, called Argo, that involves an alien invasion. They option the rights and set up an office. It all must look legit; no chances can be taken.\nGetting Mendez into Iran is not too difficult; it's getting his \"crew\" out that's the fly in the ointment. Meanwhile, the houseguests at the Canadian embassy are getting restless and paranoid. They can't go outside. The only other residents at the embassy are the ambassador and the housekeeper, who is Iranian. Something's gotta give, as they say.\nThis true story was declassified only in 1997 by President Clinton, and from what I have read, the story was left basically intact. Amazing. A single American enters a place in which Americans are essentially hated and departs with six more. That's some serious moxie. Them's some serious cojones for sure.\nAffleck's quick-paced film is stunning and evocative; a compelling, artful piece of work. He's well cast as Mendez, an operative who generally looks like he's lost, utterly alone, in the world, hoping that this mission will save him from himself. We get just enough of Mendez's backstory to see him as a sympathetic man with a lot on the line.\nIt could be that 2012 winds up being one of the best years for movies in quite a long time, and as such it might be hard for Argo to dominate as it might in other years. But it should do very well come awards time. It's already been nominated for five Golden Globes, and I can believe Oscar nods for Arkin, Affleck (thrice), Terrio, and co-producers George Clooney and Grant Heslov. \nWatching the movie can be a traumatic experience. History isn't always the best subject of Americans, so let me clue you in on this much: If Mendez had been unsuccessful, we wouldn't be watching a movie about the experience. Even those who were not alive in 1980 will be riveted, rooting for the Americans, cringing when obstacles arise, weeping when those obstacles are overcome. Chris Terrio's screenplay is powerful, but it's the interpretations given by Affleck, Goodman, Arkin, and Bryan Cranston (as Affleck's boss, and looking a LOT like George H. W. Bush) that really generate this film's strength. It's a genuinely astonishing movie, tightly edited, crisply written, and acted with true grit. Affleck himself turns in a particularly gutsy performance."}

Russell, is one of those movies with a protagonist whom you fervently wish can overcome his demons but whose methods and goals you cannot easily reconcile. The movie is witty, foul-mouthed, very poignant, elegant, and, of course, odd.\nPat (Bradley Cooper, playing way against type) has just been released from an eight-month mental-health-facility. His doctors are reluctant, but his mother (Jacki Weaver) insists he's better and that the place is, well, no place for him. She brings Pat back home to live with her and Pat's father Pat Sr. (Robert DeNiro), hoping that after eight months Pat will be able to get his life back in order once again.\nPat, though, has other plans. He had been committed to the hospital because he violently beat a fellow teacher whom he had caught in the shower with his wife. Okay, so he snapped - he was lucky that hospital care was all he got. In any event, what he wants to do now is reconcile with his wife and resume his life. Sure, there's a restraining order, which is why he goes to the trouble of reading the books she teaches in her English class, anything to prove he's more mentally fit. Oh, during his stay he loses a lot of weight (apparently), something his then-wife had harped on. (Note: She sounds like a winner to me.)\nThings do not go as planned. For one thing, Pat never takes his medication (he's bipolar), which leads to the occasional angry outburst; the song that had been played at his wedding and was played while his wife took her infamous shower is now a trigger for more violent behavior, even when he doesn't hear it. He wants badly to make amends, but he's aiming in the wrong direction, as his ex shows no signs of wishing to see him again.\nTo help him along, friends Ronnie and Veronica ask Pat over to dinner, and they invite Veronica's iconoclastic sister Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), who has social skills that are below even Pat's. The dinner isn't exactly a disaster, but Tiffany leaves abruptly and has Pat walk her home. A kindred friendship is born.\nAlthough the reason for Tiffany's behavior is somewhat important to the plot, I won't mention it here, but somehow she sees something in Pat, something honest, someone she can relate to. Meanwhile, Pat Sr., a huge Philadelphia Eagles fan, considers his son to be a lucky charm and practically begs Pat to stay and watch the game with him on Sundays. Pat Sr. desperately wishes to reconnect with his son (there's a recurring theme), but Pat is ambivalent. To cope with his own emotions, he jogs. A lot.\nThe emotional tug of war, punctuated by the Pat's own inability to control himself (still no meds for him) begins to ebb a little when Tiffany makes him a deal: she'll do something for him (not spoiling) and in exchange he will be her dance partner. You see, Tiffany studies dance as a way to cope with her demons, and there's a gala competition coming up - but one cannot compete without a partner, and she has nobody. Even her parents are wary of her. So that's the deal.\nSo on the one hand you have Pat Sr. believing his son is a lucky charm and wanting to spend more time with him anyway, and on the other hand you have Tiffany, who offers to help Pat achieve his overall goal if he'll help her. There's a lot of bickering back and forth among everyone; that is, when there's no jogging involved (note: there's plenty).\nOkay, enough about the plot; I'll stop before I do give something away. Let's look at the performances. Cooper is exceptional. We've seen him be kind of a jerk in The Hangover and a ladies' man in The A Team, and here he is as a completely conflicted man who desperately wishes to reach a goal for which he's striven for eight months. His is a raw, laid-bare performance. \nLawrence is truly stunning as the somewhat-unstable Tiffany. She's passionate, angry, caring, bitter, sweet, and she possesses even more charisma than she did in The Hunger Games or Winter's Bone. Her jaw- dropping work here is very much deserving of award recognition; Tiffany can be brutal and brittle and still completely endearing. It's the best work Lawrence has done in her short but strong career.\nSurprisingly to me, though, the standout in this cast is DeNiro. Now, DeNiro has been sort of phoning it in for a few years now, with the exception (perhaps) of movies like Limitless and Stardust. But here he really shines; it's possibly his best work since at least the 1990s. I've seen tough guys on camera get emotional, and often it just doesn't work. They can't sell it. There's a rare breed of actor who can do the macho angle and the sensitive angle and do it justice, and DeNiro, particularly here, pulls it off. Pat Sr., himself an emotional fellow, is a man full of love and passion and a man who is not without some regrets on how he's raised his kids. DeNiro brings all of that out flawlessly.\nSilver Linings Playbook is not a lighthearted movie. It's compelling drama led by a cast composed of relative neophytes and grizzled veterans. It's quirky, just like its director, and it is a clear-cut winner. Here's the best thing I can say about the movie: It feels authentic. When someone is hurt, I feel bad for them; I don't feel that they're staging it. The script is original and idiosyncratic, and every morsel of every scene is one to cherish."}

There's the adventure itself, a massive sojourn of a boy in a lifeboat - with a Bengal tiger. And then there's the meaning of the story itself, which is happily left ambiguous. It's also about the spirit and resourcefulness of man, and above all it's about hope and optimism. \nPi Patel (Suraj Sharma), named after a famous pool in France, is on his way from his home in India with his mother, father, brother, and a lot of animals (the family owns a zoo) aboard a Japanese vessel, bound for Canada. During a particularly terrifying thunderstorm, the ship sinks, and Pi finds himself on a stocked lifeboat with a few of the lucky creatures (none human) and no idea of his location.\nThe animals are inconsequential except for one - the tiger. How does one survive in a lifeboat with an untamed beast who'd love to make a meal out of him? It's not easy, and luckily our Pi is quite resourceful. Rest assured, though, there is no silent understanding between the two, even as hunger and thirst rob each of his strength. They are not friends. They each wish to survive, although a case can be made that Pi, at least, has no intention of harming/eating the tiger.\nThe tiger is not stupid - oh, quite the contrary, he is a cunning brute. He can't be cowed, and he won't allow Pi to have dominion over the lifeboat, which forces our human hero to construct a sort of floating annex to the boat, tethered and filled with supplies.\nOf great interest to me were the tantalizing, beautiful aquatic scenes. Whether it was the sight of thousands of fish flying through the air at our passengers or a glimpse into the remarkably clear water to see gorgeous - and sometimes quite large - marine life blithely swimming by, there's rarely a slow moment. Picking up the slack in such matters, of course, is how Pi survives, how he keeps his wits about him, how he manages to get by with a ravenous tiger so close by. \nIf you think that Lee is trying to present a moralistic story to us - he touches quite a bit on religion, for example - you are right. But it's not heavy handed by any means. To illustrate this, Pi (as an adult relating his tale to a writer) notes that when he was a young lad in India, he joined up with several different religions, a way to show us that he was having trouble finding his way, choosing the right path. As his father remarks to him at dinner one night, it is fine to be different, but in the end one must choose a path. Net thing you know, Pi is afloat on a raft, drifting aimlessly across the Pacific Ocean. He still had not found his way.\nIn the end, Lee doesn't appear to be trying to teach his audience. He is not moralizing; he is presenting choices and explaining how, in this situation, a single man found his way through life, not simply to survive but to live. This is not a movie about a boy and his pet tiger roaming the seven seas; it's about learning about one's inner self and finding an exciting direction in which to take it. And even apart from the symbolic journey that Pi involuntarily undertakes, there is a second moral quandary posed at the very end that will get the viewer thinking. And that, to me, is the real selling point of this movie. The beauty, the majesty, the excitement of the cross-sea trip is almost surreal - but sufficiently realistic to allow one to enjoy its wonder. Yet that final question, posed by the adult Pi, seals the deal. This is a movie best seen on a large screen, the better to appreciate its epic scope."}
< {"rating": "9", "date": "1 January 2013", "title_id": "tt0443272", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "Splendiferous - hello, awards season.", "content": "Can anyone truly be surprised that Lincoln, starring the gifted Daniel Day-Lewis and directed by Steven Spielberg, is an out-of-the-park, instant classic? The movie was destined for success as soon as those two signed on, and do they ever deliver. Lincoln is a powerful, provocative, timely piece of art that is so well crafted that it diverts focus, as needed, from the president to the issues at hand - the potential end to the Civil War and the potential ratification of the 13th Amendment.\nThe movie covers the time period of December 1864 until Lincoln's death in April 1865, with attention paid in equal amounts to the aforementioned national issues and the character of the 16th president himself, a tactful, down-home man who suppresses his emotions at the expense of his health. His is the most exasperating of dilemmas: should he agree to a peaceful accord with the confederates - and thus risk losing the fight against slavery for all time - or allow the bloodiest war to continue - and thus hope that the surrender would compel the defecting states to observe an amendment to abolish slavery? Ah, but of course there's even more to consider - would said amendment even pass? As more and more young men die each day, the decision becomes burdensome, almost Sisyphusian task.\nIn 1865, it was the Republican Party that was anti-slavery, made up mostly of Northerners, with Democrats coming from the South. In order for the amendment to pass, all of Lincoln's Republicans would need to vote for it - plus a good number of Democrats. As today, lobbyists were deployed, by the Secretary of State (David Strathairn), to convince undecided politicians to vote for the amendment if and when it was presented for a vote. Meanwhile, the confederates are requested by a Lincoln emissary to travel from Richmond to Washington to talk - but will they arrive in time? And is this what the president truly wants?\nOne thing is for certain: the machinations within political circles has not changed all that much. Secretary Seward attempts to woo some lame- duck senators with promises of jobs in Lincoln's new administration, but there are only so many jobs to go around. As these negotiations and overtures go on, the War Secretary (Bruce McGill) orders a massive attack on the rebels. Lincoln's own son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is frustrated by his father's refusal to allow him to enlist, and First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln (Sally Field) has tremendous mood swings and could well be mentally unstable.\nStanding tall above the fray is the inscrutable, yet vulnerable Lincoln himself. He sees his end and believes he can find the means to achieve it, but at what cost? See if this sounds familiar. One argument brought up by a senator against the abolition of slavery is that it would lead to Negros getting the right to vote, to be on the same ground as white folks. Topical, isn't it, with current talk about immigrants and their standing in our country. Lincoln himself puzzles over the ramifications, but he is convinced that he must first get the amendment passed and then worry about the consequences. Why? Here's a sneak-peak story. Lincoln wonders if we are born equal, if we are born for certain times or if we must fit into the times into which we are born. He even uses a Euclidean notion to prove a point, along with countless other stories with some sort of impetus behind them. This Abraham Lincoln is lawyer, teacher, thinker, philosopher, and father.\nDay-Lewis, as is his wont, disappears into the role. Imagine an Irishman playing an iconic American - preposterous! And yet there he is, plain as day, looking and sounding like he jumped out of the Oval Office in the 19th century. To say that his performance is terrific would be an astounding understatement. He breathes Lincoln, gradually allowing us to see various layers of the character. \nBut we have come to expect that from Daniel Day-Lewis, haven't we? What about Sally Field, though? Let's think about this. Sally Field is 66, 20 years older than Mary Todd was in 1865; she's only 10 years older than Day-Lewis. Can we accept her as his wife and not his mother? A resounding yes. Field hits her role hard, with raw emotion and guts, toning down the First Lady's infamous histrionics. For the past couple of decades she's done a lot of television and few big-screen roles. This may change things, oh it just might. Sally Field has just proved that an actress of certain talent can play younger. She's not just a plausible Mary Todd, she's Mary Todd incarnate.\nTheir supporting cast is filled with familiar faces, with not a slouch to be found. Hal Holbrook. James Spader. Strathairn. McGill. John Hawkes. Jackie Earle Haley. Gordon-Levitt. And a dour, bewigged Tommy Lee Jones. Spielberg doesn't mess around when it comes to casting epic masterpieces, does he?\nLincoln is a hit, from beginning to tragic end, thanks to...well, everyone. It's the kind of film that makes you forget you're in a dark room with strange people. It's the kind of film that makes you think you're standing in the balcony of the Capitol, watching the proceedings. It's deliciously detailed and does not shy away from the grisly results of the wars between men."}

It's funny, yes, but it's not a laugh riot, nor is it meant to be. It's a postcard look at a lost time, the first visit of an English monarch to a sitting U.S. president, dappled with a touch of uncertain, unlikely, and illicit romance.\nIt's a few years before The Big One, WWII, but there's a storm a-brewing in Europe. Everyone knows it, but relations between the U.S. and England have been strained, something about revolting and then fighting in the War of 1812. Ancient history to some but not all, it would seem. At any rate, King George VI and Queen Consort Elizabeth (Samuel West and Olivia Coleman, respectively) travel to America to visit Roosevelt with the intention of securing his support for the upcoming war. But rather than host them in stuffy Washington, DC, FDR (contrary to the real visit) invites his royal guests to his home away from home, Springwood, a stately manor in upstate New York. It happens to be on the Hudson River, or near it, in case the title has tripped you up.\nNow, FDR was quite an unusual president. He was the last to serve more than two terms, as the Constitution was amended later. Also, he had polio, which he had contracted as a child. The funny thing is this - people went to great lengths to pretend nothing was wrong with Roosevelt's legs whatsoever. The Emperor had no clothes. Even the press were complicit, gamely waiting for the president to be lowered into the back of a convertible before taking their pictures and asking their questions. Can you imagine that today? The slightest limp by a leader seems to imply a lack of leadership in the minds of some.\nAnd so it was at the time, only not. The nation turned its eyes to Roosevelt as a resolute, optimistic leader, a man who could help them finally rid themselves of that awful Depression, and so they gladly ignore whatever shortcomings he may have. The king of England, meanwhile, is in a similar situation. He is the same George depicted in The King's Speech - you know, the one about the king who stuttered? FDR, who is much older, is not as self conscious about his malady as he used to be, whereas poor George is practically frozen by his own. Now, recall that the king and queen are visiting to gain the support of America; FDR already knows this. He could easily just issue a statement to the effect that the USA would help England in any way it could, but he chooses to host royalty instead. He wishes to meet the man beneath the crown, and he wishes to size him up. \nEnter into the fray a quite-distant cousin of FDR, a Daisy Stuckley (Linney), who narrates the story. Daisy is introduced to the president, and somehow they find a connection. Daisy, like the arriving king, is also unsure of herself, a bit of an ugly duckling among the glamor of the president's residence. They find in each other a kindred spirit. Franklin is more or less estranged from his saintly wife Eleanor at this point (they live in separate houses in New York!), and although he cannot walk, he does enjoy him some female company.\nBut what is this story really about, anyway? It depends on your own perspective. Some will see this as a docudrama reflecting the meeting of two leaders (and their wives); some will see it as a comedy, an intelligent, subtle comedy with a barely smirking Bill Murray. Others still will find romance in almost every scene, no matter who the players, no matter where the setting.\nMurray deserves an Oscar nomination here, and perhaps the Academy will make up for their Lost in Translation snub. Linney does as well; her Daisy never undergoes a sudden transformation into a woman with a real backbone. She seems sad much of the time, working in the White House with tightened lips. Her life appears joyless; that is, until she has some alone time with Franklin, whence a window to a sunnier day slowly opens.\nHyde Park on Hudson is a gorgeous movie with a splendid, bemused, and convincing performance by Bill Murray as our 32nd president and endearing, exhilarating role for Laura Linney. Each should be richly rewarded come award time."}

Heck, you might want to think twice about letting them see a second of this movie, what with all the blood and guts and colorful language. But putting that aside, as we must, Django Unchained is clearly one of the best movies of 2012, even one of the very best of Quentin Tarantino's strong career.\nIt's the antebellum South, and blacks and bought and sold like cattle. One of them, the titular Django, is being led through a thick forest, chained to several other male slaves, when a German dentist, a Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) frees him, slaying his captors and bidding the remaining slaves a fond adieu. Schultz's plan is simple. He is actually a bounty hunter, and he is on the trail of three men wanted for murder and train robbery. He has discovered that Django knows the men on sight, and Schultz himself does not. Thus he deputizes the still-technically-a- slave Django to help him find the three baddies; if Django can point out the men, Schultz will grant him his freedom. \nTheir trek takes them to the plantation of one Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), who's pretty vicious even by slaveholder standards. Schultz and Django pose as a duo who wish to purchase a mandingo fighter, with Django - as a free man - the proclaimed expert on such fighters. You see, Schultz and Django have an ulterior motive - they wish to find Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who was sold separately from Django, and they have reason to believe she resides with Candie.\nAs bullets fly and flecks and spurts of blood practically pirouette in the air, one can easily appreciate the majesty of the art of film. Yes, that's an over-the-top sentiment, but it doesn't apply to many movies. Quentin Tarantino is famed for trying to get just the right shot, much like Stanley Kubrick before him. There's a certain poetic symmetry to every cocked pistol, every framed desert background, every lash of a terrifying whip. This is a brutal film to watch, and it is unflinching in its depiction of the true evil of slavery. The domination of fellow man was bad enough, but the physical and ultimately psychological terrorism defies description. It was not a proud moment in our country's history.\nBut we in the 21st century know all about that, and this film is not simply about the brutality of man versus man. Believe it or not, it is a love story and the lengths to which a man will go, the horrors that he will endure, to be reunited with his beloved. Foxx is astonishing as Django, who's played not as an overzealous vengeful machine but rather a taciturn, intelligent, multilayered man among men. Schultz, his conniving compatriot, is every bit as compelling as he was in Tarantino's earlier Inglourious Basterds; crisp, wise, always many steps ahead of his foe. DiCaprio is (surprisingly) convincing as the menacing, degenerate Candie. At one point, Candie rhetorically asks why, as he is always surrounded by black folks, none of them rise up to kill him; I wondered why there were no white women around him at all, save for his sister, whom he mouth kisses, but maybe that was just mere coincidence. I digress. Samuel L. Jackson turns up as the head black man on campus who serves his master well - but is he more Luke Skywalker or more Darth Vader? He's also almost unrecognizable playing a old, cane-leaning codger with the mouth of a sailor and the crusty sentimentality of the worst grandfather ever. It's a good role for him.\nI did mention this is one heck of a bloody movie, right? You've heard of Quentin Tarantino, right? Okay, then. If you dislike gory stuff, stay away. This is an homage to the old spaghetti Westerns of the past, although Tarantino himself refers to this one as a Southern, seeing as how it takes place mostly in the Deep South. That means confrontations with sheriffs, marshals, bandits, and other colorful - pardon the bad pun - people. It is not a pretty, romanticized ode to the West. It is a mean time filled with vile behavior, and of this comes the love of two.\nNow comes the raving part, or at least more of it. I loved this movie. Thought it was terrific from start to finish. Some twists, all plausible. And you should see the cast list - a who's who of who is that? Don Johnson? Tom Wopat? Franco Nero? Russ Tamblyn and his daughter Amber? I love Tarantino's casting. Not to gush, but it's always nice to see a director who appreciates cinema's long history. Add the attention to detail, the courage to show some grisly scenes that could cause one to look away in horror, and you have a rumbling roar of a movie."}

What makes it work are the flawless performances by Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds and a strong supporting cast (Brendan Gleeson and Vera Farmiga). It does have its twists, and they're plausible. It's a violent, searing, and gritty film that grabs you by the shoulders and shakes real hard.\nReynolds is Matt Weston, which sounds like a superhero's alter ego. Weston is a CIA employee who runs a safe house in South Africa. Nothing ever happens in the safe house. Until one fateful day, when one of the most wanted men in the world waltzes into the U.S. Consulate in South Africa to turn himself in. That man, Tobin Frost, is a notorious seller of secrets, a man known to have sold out his country years ago. And of course, he's the best agent ever, as they typically are in these movies, and here he's played by Washington, who actually is one of the best actors ever. \nNow, a contrived script would have us believe that Frost is innocent, that this is all one big frame job to cover up something or other, but director Daniel Espinosa never pretends that Frost is anything but a bad guy. Well, maybe not terrible, but most certainly not a moral compass. So when he's dragged to Weston's safe house and then - to Weston's chagrin - waterboarded, your first thought is that this may as well be SOP for the CIA, as far as we know. The CIA wants something from Frost, but he's calm and collected, and his chief captor (an oily Robert Patrick) is not. And then, making a tough situation untenable, the house itself is attacked by unknown outside forces. Someone else wants Frost. Safe house, indeed.\nAll of this leads to Weston and Frost on the run from pretty much everyone. Back home, CIA chiefs Farmiga and Gleeson argue over whose fault it is that Frost has been compromised, and Sam Shephard, playing their boss, tells them to skedaddle on over to South Africa. Okay, he didn't say \"skedaddle,\" but he could have. Weston loses Frost, finds him, loses him, and so on through a series of entertaining action scenes in which civilians and cops alike are shot down, which rarely happens in these movies (usually, stray bullets just miss everyone). And it's on to the new safe house! Should go swimmingly.\nThis is a very good pairing, Washington and Reynolds. Both are versatile actors, playing comic, dramatic, good guy, bad guy, jerk. Reynolds is believable as the newbie who wants to get away from South Africa and be somewhere with his French girlfriend. Wouldn't we all, Matt? But darn it, he just can't get a break until now. And Washington, who's more frequently the good guy hero (when he's not the down-and-out loser for whom one feels sympathy) is outstanding as the wily, conniving, but moralistic Frost. His ultimate motives are unclear, and that unpredictability plays in nicely with Washington's portrayal.\nSafe House is solid, riveting action that, although it has the veneer of a derivative plot, escapes the land of the clich\u00e9 thanks to powerful acting, a tight script, and a genuinely nice twist near the end."}

This is the story of Bilbo Baggins, who makes his first appearance as a young lad in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.\nIf I could use just one word to describe the film, it would be \"wow.\" Or maybe \"gosh\" or \"gee\" or \"holy COW\"...but those are two words, and I am digressing. The movie is in 3D and will also be available in IMAX. I saw it in 3D. It's worth it in 3D. It's a beautiful, stunning film that feels right in line with the earlier Lord of the Rings movies, even though it's set 60 years earlier and derives from what's best described as a children's book.\nBilbo (Martin Freeman) is a hobbit. Hobbits are smaller than you and me. Well, you, anyway. They're short. They live simple lives, and they love it. Theirs is an agrarian society. No magic, no oddities, and above all no adventures. And such is the case with Mr. Baggins, who lives in a home called Bag's End in an area known as The Shire. He is content. Until the mysterious wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) appears suddenly, as is his wont, and offers Bilbo a chance at a grand adventure indeed. It involves several dwarfs who wish to trek back to their homeland, which has been usurped by a huge dragon named Smaug, and reclaim it as their own. I know, it sounds simple and that Bilbo might be slumming by tagging along, but off he goes anyway. Reluctantly.\nNow, please bear in mind that, like the LOTR movies, this is just the first of three films. The entire Hobbit story isn't told. That means we spend more time in certain areas than we might have if the book had been filmed in one shot. The unsightly squad, with their faux burglar (Bilbo) run into comical stone giants and put on a rotating spit, then beset by orcs and goblins, and then at some point, deep within the goblins' mountain, Bilbo runs into a familiar (to us) face: Gollum, nee' Smeagol, the keeper of the One Ring. \nMuch of the movie, with New Zealand stepping in admirably again for Middle-Earth, involves the troupe running from things. Running across fields, down into caves, through caverns, across more fields, up and down mountains, and so on. Lots of running. Considering most of these dwarfs are built like beer kegs and not Kenyan runners, I'm kind of surprised none of them suffer a cardiac arrest or two. But again, digression.\nAnd much of the plot, aside from the standard journey to a faraway land, involves the development of Bilbo as, well, a man. Hobbit, whatever. He's meek and mild, but he finds his courage, several times over, through the course of just this film. The gleaming sword given to him by Gandalf helps a mite, too. But still! Cunning and courage and whatnot from a lowly hobbit! (Literally lowly.)\nYou will see some familiar faces. Let's just say that Rivendell is on the way, just as it was/will be in the first LOTR movie. There takes place a debate about whether the dwarfs, led by the great Thorin Oakenshield, really should be doing what they're doing. Saruman the White is pretty set against it, but Lady Galadriel seems to trust Gandalf more than anyone. And so our dwarfs run from place to place, lopping off orc heads as they go. It's pretty neat.\nIs this a movie for kids, though? It's based on a kids-like book that's much lighter than the LOTR stuff to follow. And it is PG-13, of course. But it's not a family film in the sense that, oh, The Polar Express is. It can be scary at times, and the 3D - well used - heightens that. The dwarfs are great comic relief, but they don't dull the edge of a quick- paced, very well shot film. The youngest shouldn't be in the theater, but it's suitable for the tweens and above. With plenty of great action for the rest of us, too."}

It has a bit of a nasty streak, a relatively incoherent plot, and a brief running time, although the latter might be considered a positive. It's grimy, unreasonable, and seems to give off a generally displeased vibe, as if it just didn't want to be made in the first place.\nThe plot synopsis says that three friends find Something underground that gives each of them telekinetic powers. Well, two of them are cousins who only kind of tolerate each other, and one is an introvert with whom the other two hang only because he has a HD videocamera. Comes in handy when you want to film yourself flying around Seattle.\nYes, it's another movie shown through the perspective of another camera lens. In some movies, this gambit works; the process makes the viewer feel more a part of things, as if he or she is experiencing the story just as the characters are. Here, though, we feel conversely removed from the proceedings, as if we're watching a movie being filmed. That's because quite a bit of suspension of disbelief is required for this kind of movie, and trying to introduce the veritas of a camera just doesn't gel with the intent.\nAndrew (Dane DeHaan) is the kid with the camera, Alex Russell plays his smart cousin Matt, and Michael B. Jordan is class president/popular kid Steve. At a rave - yes, they do still exist - the three find a big hole, wind up in it, find something that's not explained (doesn't have to be) and soon find they can lift objects, including themselves.\nThe basic morality of the movie is the use of their new powers - for fun, for good, or for something else? Matt wants rules, such as no hurting people. Andrew, who has been repressed and abused for most of his life, chafes at that possibility. Steve just sort of wants to have fun. Matt uses these new-found powers to help get Andrew out of his shell - he knocks 'em dead at the school's talent show and is the man of the hour at the big party afterwards - but it's soon obvious that the years of pent-up rage are affecting Andrew along with his powers, and something's gotta give.\nI don't need to tell you what. Bad things happen. Friendships are questioned. There is death and plenty of mayhem. After a while, I stopped being interested in the dynamics within the Steve-Matt-Andrew friendship, and even the effects became rather lame, uninspired, and impotent. We see them fly, even toss a football while way up in the sky, but we don't get to see them fly through the city, a la Spider-man. Well, you know what I mean. We see a lot of little stuff, then some parlor tricks. \nThe film moves as if it's late for something. When a character turns, you expect to feel something - glee, disdain - but here there's nothing to be felt, because we're immediately whisked away to action of some kind. In fact, it's not that there's a lot of action but rather many, many short scenes with some action in them. If you add that to shallow plot development, you get a mundane movie that should be anything but. The actors don't do the plot any favors, either; it feels as if they were selected because they were unknown, not in spite of it.\nI didn't have high hopes for the movie, although I did think it would be more like Jumper or Push, which shows you how little I anticipated Chronicle to begin with. But I saw it anyway."}

Not a good movie. But The Collection is very surprisingly good. Well, it does help if you're into bloody violent movies, I suppose. But still: I'd never heard of its predecessor (The Collector), so why would I expect this to be anything but soul-suckingly dull?\nRight from the beginning, you're smacked with gore. A quartet of teens heads to a happening party at an old warehouse, with a special password required to get in. But after a few dances are danced and a few feels are copped, our evil killer shows up, behind the scenes, and sets forth a Rube Goldberg series of devices to slaughter almost everyone. Well, you know, some are left behind for extra special torture and such, but the movie doesn't dwell on them (as Hostel did), and of course one of them, Elena (Emma Fitzpatrick) actually survives. Elena finds a man trapped in a box, and when she lets him out, yet another trap is unleashed that just nearly gets her. Then there's a running around bit, then the man-no-longer-in-the-box uses the body of a dead teen to escape the building entirely. \nThe following gives nothing away. The man is who's left from the first film, apparently, and although he thinks he's escaped for good, some surly looking henchmen with guns come looking for him. Apparently our Elena has a moneyed father who's hired mercenaries to get her back, and our mystery man Arkin (Josh Stewart) is the only possible key; he must lead them to the killer's lair.\nThose of you who have read this far like this kind of movie, probably. You liked the Saw films, more or less. Well, this is like Saw in that there's plenty of icky fluids and shock value, but there's really none of the morality. Not a whit, and that's not a bad thing. What we have is a collector of humans for various purposes. We don't know why. We don't care why. We just want to get out of this place. \nSometimes movies try the same tricks over and over to spook the audience, and eventually the return on investment withers on the vine. But here, even late into the game, moments occur that just seem out of nowhere, blindsiding you into chills. This is a movie that quite consciously decides not to show you everything, to allow looming darkness scare you more than the horrors you can see. As an aside, they're both kind of terrifying.\nSo as a horror movie, this is stunningly stylish without being glossy or gratuitous - at least as far as horror movies are concerned. It's well- thought-out frights; that's what I'm getting at. The characters aren't superficial, but we don't know much more than we really need to know about them. Frankly, for some we know almost nothing, and that too is a good thing. Their backstories could even be a movie. Who knows.\nThe Collection is an artistic gem in the realm of the macabre, a seamless combination of slasher movies and psychological thrillers. The acting is minimalistic, as befits the genre, and the effects are complex and, at times, mind boggling."}

It's quickly paced, perhaps too quickly so, but the action scenes are memorable, as are the usual locales and women. Daniel Craig continues to solidify his hold on the iconic British spy.\nA hard drive containing the secret identities of all of MI6's secret agents has fallen into the wrong hands. You may ask why there would be one drive that contained all of that info, but that's neither here nor there for the purposes of this movie. Bond's mission is to track down the drive and exterminate the thief, but the thief has much bigger plans in mind - and they involve, of all people, M (Judi Dench). M's past has everything to do with this plot, and its central theme is one of trust.\nNow, let me get one plot point out of the way, because it's occurred in several preceding Bond films - James dies. Or maybe he doesn't, who knows. The man has come back from the dead about a dozen times, it seems. It's what happens afterward that may make you scratch your head, an entire sequence of scenes that don't seem to make a lot of sense, based on what we've come to learn about Bond over the past 50 years. The way Bond deals with certain events just doesn't seem in character.\nBond has some help. On an initial mission gone bad, he is accompanied by Eve (Naomie Harris), who can drive and shoot and is otherwise a capable agent. Then there's a new, young Q (Ben Whishaw), who is naturally a computer whiz - a necessity in a movie in which the ages of both M and Bond are contrasted with the rapidly changing outside world. They're relics, you see. \nThe bad guy here is played by a blond-bewigged Javier Bardem. He has control of the list, and he's releasing the identities of all agents, five at a time, for no apparent reason. Okay, there's a reason, it's apparent, but it's mundane. When it's explained to you, you might have trouble buying it as a logical explanation. You see, here's one thing we know about our double-O agents: they sign up for their missions knowing they could die and that their lives are not more important than the mission and certainly not more important than the country itself. So if there's an issue of trust in this movie, it's that I had trouble trusting the movie to be on the up-and-up. It's one of those times when a movie makes a rule for itself and then breaks it just to further a plot.\nThat's not to say that the movie is not entertaining, because it really is. The action scenes are, as typical, well shot; there's car chases, train chases, fights, and even a chase on the London Tube. There are locales as diverse as Macau, Shanghai, London, and Scotland (the country, not the Yard). There are few bon mots and plenty of gunplay. In some sequences, it's as if we're watching an old Western. The cinematography is definitely up to par.\nI believe that while Craig's Bond takes a step forward in development, Dench's M takes a step backward. There's a difference between being stubbornly British and being unrealistically foolish, so I found M to be a little less believable than I had in previous films. Dench does her best in a role that's much more physical here than it had been in the past, too. Bardem makes a terrible villain, and I mean that in the good way. He's diabolical, insane, and yet creepily believable.\nOverall, the movie is like many other Bond films - likable, not too dark, not too deep, filled with action and gorgeous women and settings. It is by no means a bad film, or even a mediocre film. It's a good film. I was just baffled by some of the plot developments, and I felt there was too much time spent on extra, dispensable characters. It was also no surprise to me that, when a particular actor showed up, he would be very, very much involved in not only the end of the movie but also movies to come, and that's a shame (the knowledge, not the fact)."}

I enjoyed it.\nTintin (voice of Jamie Bell) is a young-lad reporter who, apparently, finds himself in extraordinary situations with some frequency. While shopping in a local market, he purchases a model boat called the Unicorn. Almost immediately, Tintin and his faithful canine friend Snowy are pursued by the mysterious Mr. Sakharine (Daniel Craig), ostensibly so that the latter can complete his collection. But of course that's not the real reason, is it? No, he's after more, much more. It all has to do with the Unicorn's real-life namesake and what happened to it (scuttled at sea) and, more importantly, what it carried. Right off, Tintin (okay, Snowy) discovers a scroll hidden in the model's mast that may be a clue to something bigger - but there are two other scrolls.\nIt's an old-fashioned treasure hunt. Tintin runs into a frequently inebriated Captain Haddock (voice of Andy Serkis), who has a strong connection to the original Unicorn and to the scrolls themselves. With Haddock and Snowy at his side, Tintin races across the globe to solve the mystery before Sakharine, a journey that takes him to multiple continents, fighting bad guys with swords, guns, fists, and feet. It's a throwback movie; a movie quite similar to Raiders of the Lost Ark, itself a throwback to the serials of the early 20th century. And, of course, the director here is one Steven Spielberg, whom you might recognize as a progenitor of that Raiders universe himself.\nThe movie is animated, both literally and figuratively, and the animation is so exquisitely realistic that it's easy to perceive it as completely lifelike. The action is intense and relentless, but because of the depth of detail in the animation, it's tough to imagine it as anything other than a terrific live-action film. When Tintin leaps from building to building or from a moving car, we actually cringe - can he make it? \nHere's an added bonus - apparently, the movie is very close to the source material. Tintin has not been updated or modified to mollify new audiences; remember, so many Americans have never heard of the intrepid reporter. And there's no time waste on explaining who Tintin is, or what he is, or how old he's supposed to be. You know why? Because it's irrelevant, that's why. He's just an adventuring dude with a smart dog and a lot of panache. \nBell, Serkis, and Craig are all superb in their roles (the latter two have dual roles each). Simon Pegg and Nick Frost show up as Interpol agents named Thompson and Thompson and offer excellent comic relief; are they bumbling, or are they just that good? It's the latter.\nThere really is so much to like about this movie, and it's one of those rare films that can be recommended not only to children in general but to girls and boys alike. It's artful, engaging, fascinating, and wonderful to behold."}

It looked solid. Denzel Washington as a heroic pilot who may have other, deeper issues? Sounded good to me. Sounded almost like Oscar bait, even. But it's not. It's about fifteen minutes of awesome (at the beginning) and ten minutes of solid sweetness (at the end) and them more than an hour of crap. Washington tries hard (sometimes way too hard), but his character is so incredibly unlikeable that when the expected epiphany occurs I didn't feel empathy toward him, I felt relief that it was finally, blissfully over.\nWashington is Whip Whitaker, an experienced airline pilot. Flying out of Atlanta, he encounters some severe weather but manages to thread a needle through the clouds to clear skies. Problem averted until about half an hour later, when the plane begins to fall apart. Whip pulls off an interesting, unfathomable maneuver, flying the plane upside down for a short time to arrest an extremely steep descent. The plane crashes, and nearly everyone survives. But there's more to the story - had Whitaker been drinking prior to flying?\nYes, it's a FWI (flying while intoxicated) movie, and suddenly it's not about the awesome crash but rather the character of one Captain Whitaker. It's about his fall, rise, fall, fall, fall, fall, rise?, fall, and so on from grace, with the help of a lawyer (Don Cheadle), his best friend (John Goodman), an ex-junkie (Kelly Reilly), and a union rep (Bruce Greenwood). Will Whip rise to the occasion, or will he sink further into decline, hastening his own demise? There's a hearing coming up with the NTSB. Will Whip give it all he's got, and then some, for the sake of his own life, those of his kid and ex-wife, and those of the wreck's survivors? A little while into the movie, you realize these questions are not only moot, they're boring. \nWhitaker is a jerk. He's a charmer, sure, but essentially he's a selfish jerk who rebuffs everyone's attempts to help them (even if they're cynically doing so to save their own careers), until...well, you probably know until when, because the movie follows the blueprint of every down-in-the-bottom-and-then-redeemed story to date. \nIf you enjoy watching Denzel Washington in any movie, this is your movie - because it's any movie, you see. If you enjoy seeing Denzel Washington mumble like a person who's learned that people mumble when they're drunk, this is also your movie. He doesn't act so much as pretend to be a character, and here he thinks that character is Denzel Washington, Drunk Guy. He stumbles, he mumbles, he mutters, he stutters, and that's about it. \nIn most of Washington's movies, he's the one carrying the film. Here, he's surrounded by a very capable cast, and they prop him up like a cigar-store Indian. Cheadle and Greenwood have great scenes together, Reilly is a wonderful find (I didn't realize she was British - excellent southern US accent), and Goodman not only steals his scenes, it's almost as if he's acting in an entirely different movie altogether.\nI wouldn't recommend Flight. Despite previews that almost make it seem like an action movie, or at least a psychological drama, it's neither of them. It's a standard-issue hard-luck story, but by the end you might not care whether the main character overcomes his obstacles or not, and that's a death knell for movies like this."}

You don't show the slashing! You don't show the thing that's coming at you! You hide things in shadows, under layers, beneath covers, physically and, more importantly, psychologically. Consequently, the movie messes with your mind, annihilates any preconceived notions you may have about the genre, and the invites a cataclysm of morbid monstrosities into your living room. It's an honest-to-goodness scary movie.\nCowritten by Joss Whedon, the movie follows a pretty standard premise: a group of five stereotypes journey to a remote cabin for the weekend, and bad things happen when they venture into the basement on a dare and read from an ancient tome. Now, if you're not in on the joke - that is, no one's spoiled it for you - you're probably nodding right now in recognition. This is what happens in these movies. This is not new. To add to that, your characters are straight out of central casting: a jock, a pretty girl, a wallflower, a stoner, and a smart dude. It seems too trite to be true, and it most certainly is.\nThe movie intentionally deals in tropes from all kinds of scary movies. Zombies. Zombie families. Ghosts, blobs, redneck hillbillies with chainsaws. Cave-ins. By now, you're reading this and, still naive to the actual plot, are starting to catch on. You see, this is what the Scream movies should have been. You remember those, right? They loudly and proudly proclaimed they were \"in on the joke,\" but with every known horror-movie rule they explained to a knowing audience, the characters in that movie broke another one. It was a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nBut not here, oh no. Our characters are never in control of anything. They aren't wiseasses; they're just caricatures, symbols of certain archetypes. They make their choices and deal with the consequences. If a game is being played, it's not rigged in their favor; it may not, in fact, be really rigged at all.\nIt isn't long into the movie that we learn the cause of our heroes' distress. It would be unfair to detail it here, but let's just say that others can see every move they make and that there is apparently plenty more at stake than the lives of five measly young adults. \nIn addition to the thrills that the movie offers, there's a great contrast between what the characters experience (as mere victims) and what goes on behind the curtain. When the audience realizes this, the movie...well, it's a whole new movie. Suddenly it's not about the fate of those five, it's about a heck of a lot more than that. Or less than that, if one doesn't buy the given premise at that turning point. \nThere are few recognizable names in the cast. Richard Jenkins, Bradley Whitford, and even Sigourney Weaver show up. They're not the focus here. What will be recognizable are the monsters, the breadth of which cannot be overstated. The action at its best is so frantic it might take a DVD pause to spot a particular baddie. There's mayhem, there's a lot of bloodletting, there's gore, and there's a visceral sense of satisfaction that cannot be simply slapped together by amateurs playing movie makers.\nFor me, Cabin in the Woods was terrifying, and in the gleeful, do-it- again way. I don't think it means to be realistic, even in its created environment. It's scary in the jolts and the surprises and the smack- you-in-the-face action. Does it seem like I'm gushing too much? Not half as much as blood gushes in the movie. Okay, that was a cheap shot, but it was fun to type. This is an essential scary movie."}

It has all of the requisite elements of lavish costumes, true love, love for money, love of money, and true lust. It is easy to see how anyone who's a fan of this kind of movie would enjoy Anna Karenina. I am not one of those people.\nAll right, so we have established I'm not big on period pieces. But I did like Dangerous Liaisons, which is about all of the above, plus murder. I admire fine costumery. I like complicated sets depicting a long-ago time. But why didn't I like Anna Karenina? Well, it probably has to do with the source material.\nTo begin with, I have never read Tolstoy's novel of the same name, and I don't plan to. It is possible that the book is much more detailed and colorful and that it is infinitely better than director Joe Wright's cinematic vision. But because reading the book isn't a requisite for watching a movie, this shouldn't count against me. I had the general idea of the plot, and off we went.\nAnna (Keira Knightley) is the wife of a Russian bureaucrat, Alexei Karenin (Jude Law). But then Anna notices/is noticed by a certain Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who is in the middle of wooing another member of the nobility, Kitty (Alicia Vikander). Soon Vronsky is pursuing Anna, who rebuffs him at first but soon enough can't control her emotions.\nAt first blush, this may seem like a classic love triangle, only Alexei is of such fine character that although he disapproves of his wife's infidelity, he refuses to make a fuss about it - at least until other people begin to notice and Anna and Vronsky begin to make spectacles of themselves. This is mainly because Alexei realizes full well that his is a loveless marriage to Anna, and her happiness is not a bad thing - so long as it does not have a strong negative impact on his standing among Russia's elite. \nAs the characters bounce from unrequited love to mutual lust and back again, I wondered for whom I should root. Surely one of them was a good person at heart and simply had bad things happen to them. Or perhaps they simply made bad choices - nothing wrong with that! We've all made bad choices, whether it's attending community college for more than two years or buying a Zune. We each have our past demons to slay.\nThen I watched the characters' lives unfold. Anna does a lot of things wrong and makes plenty of mistakes. But she does so knowingly, intending to cause harm to make herself feel good. This is not a good character! This is a selfish human being. Almost nothing Anna does throughout the movie is to help anyone but Anna. She is willing not only to stray from her marriage (which affords her all sorts of perks as a member of Russian nobility) but to flaunt it in front of her well-meaning husband. Did I mention they have a son together? None of this matters too much to Anna. Then there's Vronsky. From the very beginning he flits from woman to woman. He doesn't kiss them or more; that'd be too racy for this movie. No, he pitches woo and, worse, makes women think he's into them. Sure, that more or less makes him like most of his gender. But even after he begins messing around with the married Anna, he flirts with others and generally acts like a giant cad. True love? Anna and Vronsky don't have true love. Levin (Domhnall Gleeson) and Kitty, do - although perhaps they don't know it yet. Their story arc is infinitely more interesting and sympathetic than that of Vronsky and Anna could ever hope to be.\nThis is not to say that the movie is a lost cause. It's expertly directed by Wright, who uses a stage motif throughout the picture. That is, characters move from scene to scene, in some cases, when set pieces are moved away from them, and many of the scenes themselves take place at plays or other public recitals. It's really a quite clever way of moving the story along. In fact, the story is fast paced, dissimilar to most period costume pieces.\nKnightley and Johnson are well cast, but for my money they were outacted by Gleeson, Vikander (also in A Royal Affair), Emily Watson (as Countess Lydia), Matthew Macfayden (as Prince Oblonsky), and Law as Karenin, in a wonderfully understated performance. Here's an interesting caveat, too - it's rated R in the United States, but right now I can't recall why. There's no profanity, and even the sex scenes are pretty antiseptic and quite brief. Someone somewhere must have seen something they didn't like.\nIn all, this adaptation of Anna Karenina isn't dull, but when it reaches for something to set it apart from other versions - and, by extension, other costume period pieces - it overreaches. When your main characters are essentially unseemly and self-serving, you need to compensate by doing something different. Wright does, in his sharp direction and the choice to use the theater as a backdrop, but it's simply not enough to obscure the fact that no one in this movie, save Levin and Kitty and perhaps Alexsei himself, is worth worrying about."}
< {"rating": "7", "date": "30 October 2012", "title_id": "tt0471042", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "Fine entertainment", "content": "Tower Heist is about working joes who discover that a fat cat who lives in the high-rent apartment in which they work has absconded with the employees' pensions, a la Bernie Madoff. So the joes decide to rob the guy to get their money back by way of a wacky plan and the help of a jaded career thief and other standards of the plot.\nThe Tower is a stand-in for Trump Tower, it's been said, a high rise with high rollers. Josh Kovacs (Ben Stiller) is the building manager, and like all good managers knows everything about each of his tenants. He even plays chess over the computer with the penthouse resident, Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda), a financial muckity-muck who's so wealthy he owns one of Steve McQueen's old Ferraris. Ah, but then Shaw is nabbed by the FBI for running a Ponzi scheme. Josh is quick to defend his friend until he learns that his staff's pensions are gone with the wind - and that Shaw may have $20 million in undeclared money still in his apartment.\nJosh confronts Shaw and quickly loses both his cool and his job; then, along with his brother and law/concierge Charlie (Casey Affleck), former finance guy-turned-squatter Mr. Fitzhugh (Matthew Broderick), and the new elevator operator Enrique (Michael Pena), he comes up with a plan to get everyone their money back in just the way you'd expect from a movie plot - a hare-brained scheme. This one involves bringing in a criminal named Slide (Eddie Murphy) for help and backup. (I know what you're thinking: Eddie Murphy? Count me out. This will be crap. Please read on.)\nThe movie is not crap. I found it to be entertaining. I know it seems implausible, but hear me out. The movie is supposed to be inspired by the Ocean's 11 films, but it owes quite a bit to a lamentedly overlooked film, Who's Minding the Mint? - which starred Jim Hutton and a cast of odd characters trying to break into the U.S. Mint. In that classic, a complex plan is invoked, with each character assigned a particular cast. Same here, fewer characters. Doesn't matter - like the older film, unforeseen roadblocks emerge, trust is violated, and shenanigans ensue.\nSo why did I find it entertaining? It's so well cast. Stiller could have played this as a slapstick caricature role, but he plays it mostly straight; in fact, he forgoes the nebbishness entirely and makes his character believable simply through leadership capability, forward thinking, and so on. Josh isn't a small man thrust into a big situation; he is a normal man who truly does know his stuff and forms a plan to reach a particular goal - just as you'd imagine a real-life hotel manager to be.\nEddie Murphy also plays his role with a lot more subtlety than you'd expect. You might think he would burst into full-on Axel Foley role or some over-the-top mean ol' gangsta wanna-be, but he doesn't. Oh, his Slide is a bit of a bastard, but the point is that he is a completely believable bastard. The script allows Murphy to, well, act instead of simply playing a role. That's an important distinction, I think. How many times has Eddie Murphy played a role that made you think anything other than, \"Oh, there's Eddie Murphy\"? Not many; Dreamgirls comes to mind. He's so fluid and natural in this movie that you almost forget he's supposed to be Eddie Murphy, Superstar. \nI think the film is also served well by what appears to be a simple plot. Is it that simple, though? Is it possible that you get to the end to find that things aren't quite what they seemed? And when you watch the movie, don't you have a preset notion of how it'll end? Perhaps it ends that way, and perhaps it doesn't. For me, though, I found the ending to be the best of all worlds - plausible, not too tidy, and still at least a mild surprise.\nI singled out Stiller and Murphy for their great work here, but there really are a lot of other good performances: Broderick, Pena, Alda, Tea Leoni (FBI agent), Affleck, Stephen Henderson, and Gabourey Sidibe (the latter is really terrific). Oh, and here's the best part. The movie is directed by Brett Ratner, but there are no wise-ass cops to be found and, thank goodness, no explosions. Not a one. You'd never know Ratner directed it. \nTower Heist succeeds because it doesn't lose sight of what it wants to be - a comedic caper, nothing more. It doesn't pretend to be overly complex, like those Ocean's films. It doesn't rely on deep characterizations. It doesn't allow itself to get tripped up in minutia. It is simply a well-thought-out, well-put-together film with fine, believable acting."}

It's a movie that'll make you check your watch every so often, maybe glance at the exits. It has its moments, and a very good cast, but it lacks strong direction and likable, relatable characters.\nIt's the late eighteenth century in Denmark, which is ruled in name by Christian V (Mikkel Boe Folsgaard). He takes British lass Caroline (Alicia Vikander) as his bride, but neither really likes the other. She's pretty; he's insane. Or is he? Anyway, while the two of them stay apart from each other, enter a German doctor named Struensee (Mads Mikkelsen), who's been nominated to be the king's personal physician as a way for members of the Enlightenment - still with me? - to get into the inner royal circle. They succeed, and thus is set up a quasi love triangle between a German, a Briton, and a Dane.\nIf you like period pieces in general, I probably don't have to tell you what this is all about. It isn't long before the doctor and the queen take a liking to one another, and it isn't long before the doctor is insinuating himself into the Royal Court - at Christian's behest, it should be noted. Struensee has ideas, you see, reformation ideas. Denmark is not exactly on the leading edge of free thinking, you see; its streets are filled with grime and rats and feces, while the nobility enjoy lavish lifestyles. Struensee aims to change this if he can, and he's able to convince Christian to endorse his ideas.\nNaturally, this behavior won't go by unnoticed; the Queen Dowager, the stepmom of the king, wants her son to be the next in line and is quite displeased when the queen gives birth to a boy. And thus the machinations begin to wrest control away from Christian, to divide him from both Caroline and the doctor, and to return Denmark to the Middle Ages.\nOf the three characters, it is the king who is the most intriguing, yet director Nikolaj Arcel gives us almost nothing regarding the character's intentions, makeup, wants, likes, and so on. He's a supporting character, taking a backseat to the other corners of the triangle. Early in the movie, we learn a nifty tidbit - the king is a fan of Shakespeare (he and Struensee trade lines) and loves acting in general. Why wasn't this aspect played up at all? I'll tell you right out how that characteristic could have been useful; like Hamlet, everyone seems to think that Christian is mad. And, like Hamlet, the audience isn't sure if he really is. Had that aspect been explored more deeply, we may have had an interesting movie. Instead, poor Christian is relegated to the sidelines, useful only as a tool handled by others.\nVikander makes for a lovely queen (from an American perspective, she could be a stand-in for Natalie Portman) and really turns in a fine role. She's a good person who does her best. She's not unlikeable, exactly, but again we don't see multiple layers in her. Although Vikander tries her best, the character is one dimensional, a symbol for beauty and righteousness - but not necessarily strength of character or even convictions, if she has any. She seems destined to be a victim and nothing more.\nAnd then we come to Dr. Struensee, a good man thrust into a situation of which he can take advantage. He's a leading voice of the Englightenment, although anonymously, and he can see that with Christian he can do great things. The movie is told mostly from his perspective and how he interacts with the king and the queen. But while we see Christian's madness/acting and Caroline's smiling/gloomy face, Struensee almost never changes his facial expression. It's not that there aren't multiple layers to the man, it's that the layers are equally boring.\nThe movie is slow without being pretentious, at least for a period piece. I would call it contrived and predictable if these events hadn't taken place (at least in general). But it seemed that every time Something Big happened, it was only a result of implausible circumstances. Maybe this was all true, but if so the truth is loaded with ennui.\nAnd of course, if you don't like period pieces, stay the heck away. There are no surprises, nothing out of the ordinary, plausible or not. A Royal Affair feels like someone entered \"royal love triangle\" into a computer and got a workable script."}

In fact, most of you have stopped. Why read a review about the fourth movie in a horror series that uses the same gimmick (found footage) each time? I don't blame you, I blame the game. So you're off the hook.\nFor the rest of you, I'll lay it out simply. The fourth Paranormal Activity movie isn't bad, just not the classic that the first one was or even parts of the next two were. This is not uncommon with horror franchises (Saw). It is worth seeing in the theater (although probably not IMAX), as long as you're invested in the series and have indeed seen the preceding three.\nThe theme of the day is, again, possession. We've learned a few things from prior PA movies and, without giving them away here, I can note that the events in this film take place approximately six years after the events of the second film (the third was more of a prequel about the childhood days of Katie and her sister).\nAs you may recall, the movies are shot as if we're seeing them through a camera (camcorder, laptop, camera phone, etc.), with the intent being to place us directly in the perspective of the particular character (or room). This lends quite a bit of verisimilitude to the proceedings, but it's a trope that can be overdone pretty quickly. \nTo account for this, directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman use laptops and the established video chats between plucky teen Alex (Kathryn Newton) and her boyfriend Ben (Matt Shively). A recorded chat shows something weird about the kid who lives across the street, Robbie (Brady Allen); Robbie quickly comes to live with Alex and her family when his mother needs to be hospitalized, a malady that's never explained.\nStrange things are afoot in the house. Knives disappear. Chandeliers fall. Robbie is as lifelike as a Village of the Damned kid, although he gets along well with Alex's younger brother Wyatt (Aiden Lovekamp). Meanwhile mother Holly (Alexondra Lee) and father Doug (Stephen Dunham) don't get along, and the kids notice. Well, Alex does. Hard to know what's going on in Robbie's head, and suddenly Wyatt is more withdrawn.\nThe shock factor is in full play here. By now, you've become inured to things skulking in the background or people being dragged by unseen forces. The use of a night-vision feature on a laptop camera does break up that tedium, though, as you can see some presence sitting on the couch next to Robbie at one point. What is it? Viewers of the first three movies might have a good idea.\nI remember seeing the first in the series. I saw it at home, well after it'd become a huge phenomenon. It frightened me, I have to admit. For a day or so afterward, I tracked creaks and other noises in the house. That's a pretty effective film. I saw the other three in the theater, and although I became more used to the tricks of the found-footage trade, I wasn't less scared. This fourth one, although a little slower than its ancestors, is still pretty scary, and I think it all has to do with the perspective, usually of young Alex. What she sees, we see. That involves us, and we jump when she jumps and are trapped when she's trapped. \nOf course, we don't see just Alex's adventures; thanks to Ben's placement of laptop cameras in various rooms, the movie switches to different areas of the house when something's a-happening. This is helpful, because if your lead character is trapped in a room and all you hear is noises, you as audience member kind of want more of the story. \nSome may disagree with this with some validity, but I liked the ending. From the end of the previous films, we know the history of our characters, so we know what's behind all of the supernatural goings-on. I'm reminded of the great Spanish horror film Rec, which had a final scene that is utterly unforgettable; Paranormal Activity 4's isn't quite as ferocious, but it's still a ghastly, dread-inducing coda. I'm sure there'll be a fifth, and as usual I'll be there to see it."}

It's a mopefest with an unlikeable character in an unsympathetic premise who manages not to win over the audience but rather only to alienate them further as the movie progresses. Young Adult can't decide whether it wants to be a heart-felt comedy or a melodrama, so it fails in each attempt. It has few funny lines, few touching moments, and seems aimless and unworthy of our consideration.\nCharlize Theron is Mavis Gary, a ghostwriter of a winding-down teen-lit series who learns, via a mass email, that her former flame is about to become a dad. (Why an email is sent to someone who hasn't seen the man in question in many years, or to anyone outside of friends and family, is unexplained.) With a end-of-week deadline approaching for the final entry in her book series, Mavis high-tails it from Minneapolis (the Mini Apple!) with her little dog and big glasses in search of good ol' Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson). They belong together, she believes.\nYou can see where this is headed, right? I don't need to spell it out. For some unknown reason, Mavis truly believes Buddy will drop everything with his long-gone ex back in town. When people explain that Buddy is happily married, she scoffs. Denial? It's a running theme. It shouldn't surprise you to learn that she shows the signs of raging alcoholism.\nIn any event, we come to the purported theme of the movie - Not Moving On. Sure, a lot of folks from the old days stayed in town, but they've gotten jobs, married, kids - you know, grown up. The past is more or less the past. Mavis has a good job and lives alone on bad food in the Big City. And she pines after a high-school fling. Mavis has not Moved On.\nThere is but one person in town, it seems, who seems to care about Mavis - Matt Freehauf (Patton Oswalt), whom Mavis (of course) doesn't remember at first but then recalls a high school incident in which Matt was attacked by popular jocks and beaten half to death because they thought he was gay. Now he has a crutch (literally) and is both funny and bitter at turns. He's also a self-identified fat nerd, big into creating hybrid action figures and making his own bourbon. (Really.)\nMatt tries to dissuade Mavis from visiting Buddy, like that's going to happen. His job in the movie, it would seem, is to be Mavis' conscience. But Mavis has cheerlessly ignored her conscience all these years, so why would Matt be any greater influence? Perhaps he sees her on the same road to ruin that he's already traveled. In any event, it's a hard sell, because although Mavis realizes Matt's the only person listening to her at all, she's too self absorbed to even remember that Matt had the same locker next to her for four years or to register that he's helping her not just because he's a loser but because he pities her for her lack of maturity.\nTheron phones this one in, but she's also undone by an atypically horrendous script from Diablo Cody. It might have made a better movie to play Mavis' odyssey for slapstick laughs or perhaps for deep, internal reflection. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the best parts, and that's not saying much. There are very few good scenes, and they're good only because of Oswalt, who acts circles around his Oscar-winning counterpart. Oswalt's Matt is bitter, although we don't really see the depth of that bitterness until we're well into the movie; he distracts himself with his odd hobbies and nights at the bar and a quick, quick wit, but he is layers upon layers of misery, despair, hatred, conflict, desperation, and love. His is easily the most compelling character in the movie.\nWho can root for the main character who's so self-focused, and that lack of self-awareness is not played for laughs? Very few, I'd imagine. Mavis is just plain not likable; she's pathetic, and she's the only one who doesn't know this, and worse - we know she's the only one who doesn't know this. She acts out of her own interests, and had that been handled in an over-the-top, hair-pulling, door-slamming way, the movie could have been saved. Instead, we're essentially watching a performance akin to a person sleepwalking underwater.\nThe rest of the cast is dispensable, even Jill Eikenberry as Mavis' mother and Mary Beth Hurt as Buddy's mother. They're given almost nothing to do but show up and act concerned, pithy, or ignorant, depending on the needs of the script. They weren't needed at all.\nYoung Adult was a missed opportunity for both Cody and Theron and director Jason Reitman. An all-out comedy would have worked better, but the balancing act of humor versus melodrama never gels in this failed film."}

It's uninventive and feels like a giant missed opportunity. In fact, as the movie wears on (and on) one starts to believe that there's Something behind our protagonists' troubles - but alas, if there is, it's trivial.\nMost of the movie is set in a homemade sauna. Jenna, her friend Renee, Renee's boyfriend Michael, and Michael's friend Ian have zipped over to a remote island to stay in Ian's uncle's cabin for the weekend. Concurrently, it is the weekend of the May Day celebrations, apparently a big deal in the nearby towns, and Wade the uncle is involved with the setup of the festivities.\nWe learn a few things about our main characters right away. Jenna, meant to be the protagonist, is anxious, shy, withdrawn; flashbacks show us (in the first scenes) that her fianc\u00e9' was killed in an auto accident (with Jenna beside him), and she hasn't yet fully recovered. Friend Renee is outgoing, outspoken, caring about her pal and wanting to get her out of her self-imposed shell. Michael is the typical Type A frat boy - controlling, fun loving even at the expense of others. Ian, by contrast, is sedate, passionate, thoughtful, and well spoken; weird, because he looks like the lost Winklevoss twin.\nThe plan is for the foursome to go to this May Day pre-party, so while ol' Uncle Wade goes to set up, they head into his sauna. Then it gets too hot, so they jump in the lake. Then it's too cold, so back to the sauna. This goes on for a while. The entire time, Michael's drinking everything in sight, so you can see where this is headed. They go back to the sauna, he leaves to use the bathroom, and somehow the door gets stuck with the other three inside.\nThe point is to see how each will react to the extreme (and rising) heat, making it less a horror film and more of a psychological freak- out. Someone's going to crack - no surprise or spoiler that it's Renee, who's painted from the get-go as more selfish than most. Ian is determined to get them all out of there - he's played pretty well by Travis Van Winkle - and Jenna just tries to get by. They all assume Michael locked them in as a prank, but after a while the story switches to his passing out and just leaving them in there.\nThe movie could have gone in several directions. I kept expecting a twist; none came. This would have made for a predictable film, but since I naively kept thinking there was more to the story than met the eye, I didn't allow myself to become jaded. \nThe acting is acceptable. In addition to Van Winkle, we have the redoubtable Scout Taylor-Compton (Halloween) as the high-strung Jenna turning in a wonderful performance. But they have little to work with. People do behave as you'd expect, only in the case of some (Renee, Michael), it's more of a case of melodrama than acting. Tears are shed, as is some blood. \nBecause the movie lacks so much in substance and creativity, it's not an easily recommendable film. You have to be prepared for a lot of nothing much happening. After all, there's only so much you can do in a sauna without getting into deep psychological trauma, and the movie - although it had the opportunity - barely scratched the surface of everyone's problems. We know Jenna has issues and why, but we're unclear on how she deals with it. Would have been nice to see better character development - what does she fear now? Same for Renee; even her love for Jenna seems self serving. They've been friends forever, and Renee has an extroverted, love-life personality. Does she have demons? And does Ian do anything other than say just the right thing and be just the nicest guy ever?\nWho knows? Stories like this have been done to death in movies - trapped in an elevator, trapped in a mine shaft, trapped on a boat, and so on. They succeed because the plot involves you with the characters. Do we really care about the state of the relationship between Renee and Jenna? Not really, because the movie gives us no reason to do so. We like Jenna, we don't like Renee too much, and we're quite ambivalent over their long-time friendship."}

Abducted at age nine with his mother, whom is then killed by their kidnapper, the boy is forced to care for and clean up after his captor, a grizzled serial killer. Sheltered from the world, the boy grows up immersed in the unspeakable acts committed by his new father figure, learning about life through the twisted eyes of the killer.\nAt first, the newly named Rabbit (Eamon Farren) is as trepidatious as his name implies. He wished to escape, to return to his dad. But as the days, weeks, and months progress, escape is illusory. When he does attempt to leave, his captor Bob (Vincent D'Onofrio) chains him to his bed, leaving enough chain so that the growing lad can do his dirty work around the house (getting meals ready, cleaning up crime scenes; you know, normal stuff). Eventually, Bob decides to take a greater interest in the boy's future. Will the boy follow in Bob's footsteps, or will he earn his trust just long enough to get the heck out of Dodge?\nThe movie is a fascinating portrait of an ersatz father-son relationship. The viewer is told little of Bob's past (why does he bring so many women home to their demise?), and the story is not told strictly through Rabbit's point of view. Bob rapes and kills; Rabbit cooks and cleans. His mental growth is, at best, stunted; he's not dumb, but he is as sheltered as possible. His situation is bizarre, but it begins so early in his life that it's really all he knows. He knows of the outside world only what Bob permits him to know; one of his duties is to cut out newspaper articles relating to Bob's activities and paste them into a scrapbook. Seems kind of foolish if you're trying to elude capture, but Bob seems pretty secure in his remote farmhouse.\nThe movie itself is not a battle of wills, although Rabbit does show some periodic defiance. It seems mostly to be about brutal, unforgiving violence toward women. In brief, black-and-white flashbacks, we catch glimpses of Bob's childhood and the horrors he himself witnessed and participated in at an early age. In the present, he prowls the city in a cab, looking for victims, kidnaps them, brings them home, rapes and murders them. The boy's job is to open the door, have food ready, clean up messes, dispose of bodies. But Bob is not a stupid man. He believes he sees potential in Rabbit to work as an apprentice and possibly more. He commands the boy to learn about the human body, makes him study thick anatomy books. It's a methodical life that bears similarities in form - but not in function - to that of many working people.\nThe unorthodox relationship bears interesting consequences. Not only does Bob wish to see his young charge succeed in the art of raping and killing, he wants him to, well, feel the touch of a woman. I'm serious; this is important. The sheltered Rabbit isn't on board with the program, and it's a bone of contention - pun intended - between them for some time.\nThe first thing that struck me about this movie was how well acted it was. D'Onofrio is terrifying, and not in the movie-monster way; his character's evil seems real, all the more so because of his attention to detail, usually calm demeanor, logic, and intelligence. The character has depths that D'Onfrio plumbs to great success. Farren, as the skittish, unwilling helper, is his match: not a killer, perhaps, but by no means an innocent bystander, either.\nThe second thing is simply this - the movie's ending is pretty flat. All right, the following is not a spoiler: in the final act, Rabbit must decide whether he wants to be Bob Jr. or to get out for good. He's not fully grown, mentally or physically. So he makes his decision, with unexpected consequences. It was a good twist, well played by Farren and D'Onofrio. But then the movie continued, needlessly adding a second ending, giving us closure when we sure didn't need it. To be frank, the second so-called ending essentially opened up more questions for no good reason. Pointless doesn't begin to describe it. Picture this: you've achieved some resolution, as the viewer. You may not respect Rabbit's choice - or perhaps you do - but at least something's been completed. Then the movie suddenly, without any provocation, goes off into an entirely unasked-for direction that made no sense even after it played out. \nTo say more would truly ruin things, but to me the ending shifted the movie from \"okay\" status to \"pretty bad\" status; all of the competence of 90 minutes or so was trumped tenfold by those final scenes, as details were introduced that attempted to explain prior behavior of characters - but the explanation held little water, a leaky plot bucket.\nOn the plus side, at least Chained is a marked improvement over Lynch's last big-release film - Boxing Helena, in 1993! - with Sherilyn Fenn and Julian Sands. But that's truly damning with faint praise. Although the audience where I saw Chained seemed to really love it, I just saw it as wildly exploitative junk that couldn't even play by its own messy rules - despite compelling performances by its leads. It was almost as if Lynch was trying to sabotage her own screenplay. Chained is a horrendously directed, clueless bait-and-switch movie that dares you to identify with its leads, either one, despite giving no strong reason for you to do so."}

There is a s\u00e9ance. There is murder. There is resurrection. For a live show, it must be a one-of-a-kind experience; as a filmed version, it's still pretty exhilarating and entertaining.\nRobbins is essentially a cross between an old-time Southern minister and Vincent Price, presiding over a macabre sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of ghoulish props. With his careful intonation and quick wit, Robbins is able to play off the fears and sense of humor of the audience members to chilling comedic effect.\nThe entire show is dark, save for various lights around the stage; even the exit signs are off. At the beginning, Robbins dramatically turns over an hour glass and announces that if anyone wishes to leave, he or she may do so any time before the sands complete their fall. After that, the doors are loudly locked, and the audience is immersed in utter darkness and - for a time - quiet.\nRobbins is a master showman. He's surrounded by office-supply boxes labeled with the names of various characters. He notes that each box contains remnants of that person's life, and the story he tells is true. Each tale leads into a visceral interpretation of that character - good or not so good - and how their evil or goodness will soon infiltrate each audience member.\nOh, and did I mention that this is participatory theater? Now, I will not give away one set piece, one story. But I will say this: people get wet. People may get things thrown on them. The theater is completely dark; people are made to feel scared, but in a silly-scared sort of way. After all, they knew what they were getting into.\nAs the film audience, we are able to see the infrared recordings of the proceedings. Therefore although we ourselves don't feel a spray of liquid, we can see the audience reacting to same. It's a lot scarier than it sounds. \nThe stage version was directed by Teller of \"Penn and\" fame; the film itself was directed by Teller with Shade Rupe. You can see why someone like Teller would be enchanted by this sort of show. It's macabre, and it involves fun trickery and effects, just like his shows with Penn Jillette. In a Q and A after the movie's showing, Teller noted that sideshows and the like were tremendously popular at the onset of the 20th century but had begun to die out by the late twenties, when sound was added to movies. Live freak shows that included mediums, geeks, and other assorted freaks were a fascinating bit of Americana, at least an Americanized version of what had come over from the Old World.\nNow, I enjoyed Play Dead, enjoyed it quite a bit. It's inventive, delirious and gleeful in its chase for chills and heart-stopping terror - and yet sweetened just enough by a welcoming host with a wry wit and a real sense of melodrama. I appreciated the message shown at the outset of the film, that the audience members were not stooges. Knowing that helped me to identify with them. Could have been anyone on that stage, could have been me. Robbins was masterful at working the crowd. They - and we - were his pawns, but only with our assent."}

Although it's presented as a horror film - and opened the Spooky Movie International Horror Film Festival - it's a psychosexual thriller, rife with imagery set against a pastiche of normative teenage angst and desperation. It is a brilliant, provocative, unsettling film.\nPauline (AnnaLynne McCord) is the misfit. Scarred with acne and and overall unkempt look and poor posture, she is the poster child for unpopularity. But, like many cinematic rebels before her, she looks upon the idea of being liked almost with disdain. The opinions of others don't influence her.\nPauline aspires to be a doctor, but she is anything but a model student. She challenges her teachers and plays her classmates against each other for her own gain. She has no friends, and her therapy consists of visits to the local priest, whereupon she notes the hypocrisy of his understanding her moral issues when he's by definition pretty repressed himself.\nShe's part of a nuclear family. Dad Bob (Roger Bart) is a success at something, but he's under the thumb of his controlling wife Phyllis (Traci Lords). Sister Grace is the favorite of the family, partly because she's so nice and good and sweet but also because she is suffering from cystic fibrosis.\nOf all the people with whom Pauline interacts on a regular basis, she cares only for Grace. She despairs of her sister's imminent death and wishes the same on her mother. Typical for a teenager, to an extreme perhaps. \nThroughout the movie, Pauline sets particular goals for herself and then completes them, in opposition to her attitude toward school and life in general. When her mother forces her to be (at an advanced age) part of a cotillion, Pauline understandably ruins the affair. But when she wants to pursue a career in medicine, she goes to the library (cutting school) and researches her sister's condition.\nYou may well ask what the title implies. Something is being excised. We've already established that Pauline wants to be a doctor, but what is to be excised is something I cannot reveal here. On a less literal front, Pauline wants to excise her mother's influence from her own life and the pain and suffering from that of her sister. \nThis is not a movie for the faint of heart. It is not dripping with blood and contains no projectile vomiting, but Pauline's dreams - which include impromptu surgeries that equate to intercourse in her mind - are erotic, disturbing, grisly, and symbolic. \nMcCord nails the role of Pauline. Dolled up for the cotillion, she looks almost presentable, but even when she's her slovenly self you can see her beauty - eyes, wit, intelligence, smile - even if no one else in the movie can. McCord sells the film by subtly morphing Pauline from an outcast to a sociopath; at first, you take her for just another weird kid in the hall, but over time you see her as clearly losing her grip on reality.\nAnd I didn't think I'd say this, but Lords is really good - in an ironic role - as the pushy, moralizing mom. Traci, you've come a long way, baby.\nIt's very hard to believe this is writer/director Richard Bates Jr.'s first film, feature or otherwise. The writing is tight, and he gets a lot out of his cast - which includes John Waters and Malcolm McDowell. It's a stunning debut.\nI wasn't sure how the movie was going to end, although it was clear I was being led in a particular direction. I wasn't misled, but the conclusion is still a knockout; leaving just enough unresolved to be satisfying. \nExcision is thrilling, a movie that will resonate with anyone who's felt unloved and with anyone who likes tales of revenge and redemption. It wisely picks a course and never goes too over the top with its set pieces. It's not a mild-mannered film, but it's also not an overwrought, ham-fisted gorefest. It's cleverly nuanced, achingly acted, and a mind- blowing masterpiece."}

But the boy and his sister are both a bit more than each seems in this provocative psychological, daring thriller from Ursula Meier.\nYoung Simon (Kacey Mottet Klein) has procured a season pass to a winter ski lodge. Each day, he rides up the giant lifts to the top of the mountain, where he swipes skis, poles, boots, gloves, and other paraphernalia, selling them to the less-fortunate in the town below. He does this to support he and his sister Louise (Lea Seydoux), an unfocused, somewhat-selfish wanderer who appears too have little concern for the well being of herself or for Simon, flitting from job to job and from lover to lover like a forlorn mosquito. So it's entirely up to Simon to keep them afloat, and he's a quick learner. Even at age 12, he can cook and clean and knows ski equipment better than even expert skiers, even though he is no skier himself. He's an entrepreneur, albeit in a dangerous career.\nHe sells to workers. He sells to kids. He takes advance orders and knows how much to charge. He's not intimidated by anyone. He is, at his tender age, a master thief, knowing where to stow his ill-gotten gains and how best to get them back down the mountain. One can argue that he does what he has to do, since his youth prevents him from getting an authentic job and the adult in the family is wildly undependable. He takes on an apprentice at one point, goes into cahoots with another at a different juncture. But a few of his schemes do not end favorably for him. \nSimon is friendless, utterly alone. But his relationship with Louise is quite complicated. There are tender touches. Inappropriate remarks. Lingering glances. Is this simply typical preteen behavior, or something more? With no other friends - and apparently, no school to serve as a social function - Louise is about the only female with whom he interacts on a regular basis.\nHe meets a visiting family - mom, two boys - at the resort. Mom is kind and buys Simon breakfast, even though he is loaded with cash. They bond a little; she seeing perhaps a lost soul whose story of no parents or siblings isn't ringing true, he seeing a mother figure he desperately desires.\nThe twist in the movie makes its appearance just about halfway through. It's surprising that it arrives so early, and when it does it passes two crucial tests: it is both out of the blue and completely plausible. The perfect twist. \nObviously, the twist coming so early in the film means that the movie's real enticement comes in this major revelation - well, a revelation to the audience, not to the characters. At first, we're not sure who is telling the truth; are we being snookered? When we discover the answer to that question, the relationship between Louise and Simon takes on a whole new dimension.\nBoth Klein and Seydoux, playing characters who are almost aggressively opposite from one another, are phenomenal. Simon longs for a better life even as he excels in his current role. Louise, a tragic heroine, is mentally scarred, unsure, unhappy, and besieged by doubt. She seems of no use to him, and yet he pushes hard to make a life for them both.\nThe ending is one of those that will leave half of the audience wondering if a reel was left off by mistake and the other half nodding appreciatively. It is not a neat ending; it is awash with symbolism of the direction each lead's life is headed. And set against the majestic beauty of the mountains, it is a strong, stark, and beautiful finale."}

It's like Inception, only much less convoluted; provocative without being overwrought. It's the odd time- travel movie that understands the limitations inherent in the genre and not only doesn't gloss over them, it embraces them and makes them part of the fun. I found it so engrossing that I actually overthought one element of the story, thinking it meant something when it turned out not to. \nThe year is 2044, and life sucks just about everywhere. Cities are slums. Even cornfields aren't safe from ravaging hobos. It's bleak, like most futures are in the movies. Time travel, we're told, hasn't been invented yet. But by 2074, it will have been. And in 2074, the government is so on top of things that the bleakness of 2044 looks Paradisal by comparison. They outlaw time travel so that only outlaws can time travel. In this case, that would be organized crime. When they want someone to disappear permanently like, they send him back in time to 2044, where an assassin shoots him dead. Much more fun than dumping his body in the Pine Barrens. This erases all trace of the dearly departed. Clean, tidy.\nThe assassins are called Loopers. They don't know who they're shooting. Their prey arrives on a blanket at a particular time and place, head covered in a bag, hands bound. The Looper shoots, turns the victim over, and claims his pay in silver bars, which are big in 2044. \nLoopers have one standing order: don't let your man get away. Shoot to kill. Even if he's you. And that's the crux of this thriller, when Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) finds himself face to face with...well, himself. His 2074 self, Old Joe (Bruce Willis). Yup, that's who the mob's sent back. This is known as closing the loop, and it means your contract's been terminated. Oh, you can live your life as long as you want, but you won't be a cold assassin anymore, which kind of stinks. At any rate, there's more to it than just a loop closure. Old Joe promptly escapes his execution and is a man on a mission. He needs to kill someone in 2044 so that they don't become someone bad in 2074. That's a mission we can all get behind, right?\nYoung Joe, for lack of a better distinction, has troubles of his own. First, he isn't supposed to be free, what with his victim getting away (the entire city is looking for him). Second, he's a junkie, hooked on some future drug that you drop into your eyeballs. His own men are looking for him, he needs to find Bruce Willis, and what the heck does all of this have to do with the future, anyway? Man, a whole lot, it turns out, a whole lot. \nLet me put it this way. At first, you think Old Joe is just on a personal vendetta - which he is. But it's more than that. What he wants to do could make things a heck of a lot better in good ol 2074. But that conflicts with what Young Joe has in mind, which is to finish his job and take off for France (don't ask).\nThe movie is existential. How did Old Joe get in the position of being sent back by the mob? He IS Joe, after all, and the Joe we know seems to have his head on his shoulders. What happens? Bad stuff, apparently. But back to the existentiality of it all. Let's pose a question - if you had a chance to kill a future terrorist, would you? Is the answer an easy one? What if the baby future terrorist wouldn't become said terrorist if certain branches in his life had led to different conclusions? The old time-travel movies make it much simpler: if you see yourself in the future, that screws things up. If old you kills young you, that means you're dead, too. This movie mashes all of that together and strips out the boring parts. That makes for a really intelligent sci-fi thriller. Tough to find.\nTwists abound. I can't even begin to describe one without giving away another. Heck, Young Joe's not even a really sympathetic character. I mean, he's a nice guy, but the man sells out his friend within the first ten minutes of the movie, so he's not super awesome. Plus did I mention he's a cold-blooded killer? He is. And he is constantly faced with the consequences, ever unreeling, of not only his actions but those of Old Joe and countless other characters. Turns upon turns, a Moebius strip of plot lines.\nWhat's really at the center of the movie, the most terrifying aspect, isn't even touched on until the movie's mostly over. You think the blunderbuss that Young Joe has or the Glock that Old Joe procures are bad-ass weapons? There's another one much worse. I'm talking Stephen King worse. Oh yes.\nBoth Gordon-Levitt and Willis (who do resemble each other here) give commanding, top-notch performances. Earnest without being dull; determined without being infallible. Unheroic, except sometimes. They're strongly supported by Jeff Daniels as Gordon-Levitt's boss, Paul Dano as Young Joe's best friend, and Emily Blunt as the mother of a small, strange child. \nLooper is an awe-inspiring movie, the one that continues to resonate well after the curtain's fallen. What does it mean? Well, it's easier to pinpoint the meaning here than in movies like The Tree of Life and other New-Age nonsense, but it's the kind of movie that wisely leaves questions unanswered. And the last scene is a powerful, poignant, delicious ending. It ain't the best movie in the world (there are some unanswered questions that really should have been answered), but it's damn good among its genre."}

It's a movie that reaches for the proverbial stars in terms of magnitude and meaning, but its reach far exceeds its grasp. It tries hard, but in the end it's much more trying than satisfying, with long, predictable scenes, scenery chewing, and some flat-out dullness.\nLancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a man with a plan. He's written several (unpublished) books. Okay, one's been published, and he wins converts to his new way of thinking - this is the early 1950s - that involves looking into one's past an one's dreams to determine how to make the most of one's corporeal life. He has a couple dozen followers, including his doting wife Peggy (Amy Adams), his daughter Elizabeth (Ambyr Childers), and plenty of rich folk who love to spend money for abstract gratification.\nInto Dodd's life wanders a former Marine, Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), who has several emotional problems. He's a boozer with anger issues and feelings of neglect. When he stows away a boat on which Dodd is performing, Freddie reluctantly becomes a follower. It's not easy to change such a distressed, broken man, but Dodd tries. And Freddie is, just like the movie on the whole, very trying. \nThe entire movie can be summed up like this: Dodd helps Freddie. Freddie does something bad. Dodd takes Freddie back and \"helps\" him some more. Freddie does something bad. One is running away but can't stay away. One doesn't want to give up on his worst student. It's an endless cycle that is nearly unbreakable.\nOne strong criticism I have of the film is that Dodd is supposed to be this powerful, charismatic leader. I don't think Philip Seymour Hoffman was very charismatic at all. Oh, sure, he was loud and hammy, but that's not the same thing. Heck, R. Lee Ermey's preacher in the Chevy Chase movie Fletch had actual charisma. Dodd doesn't, not really, and it constantly made me wonder why anyone was following him, let alone giving him money. \nThere are, naturally, off-screen comparisons to the Church of Scientology, although if ever scare quotes were justified, now would be the time. Just like L. Ron Hubbard, Dodd served in the Navy in WW II and founded his belief system in the same year as Hubbard, 1952. Then there's the whole bit about there being certain rules and a reliance on obeyance, and the comparison is somewhat apt. But producers assure everyone that it's not a true comparison, nothing to see here at all.\nA distinct problem with the movie is that the storytelling is as humdrum as it can get. Because Hoffman's charisma is somewhat lacking, and because Phoenix's character isn't compelling (he's a jerk), there's no thrust to the plot. So when Freddie does do something destructive, we're conditioned to not only accept it but predict that Dodd will try again to \"save\" the troubled young man.\nIt's all hocus pocus, again much like Scientology is purported to be. Hubbard wrote his story, it was said, as a work of fiction, and so here Dodd is accused of making things up as he goes along. There's little religion here, just a cult of mindless twits who would be believable only if they had been drugged, Jim Jones-style, except without the poison. Anyway, because the main characters and the plot lack any real punch, the movie suffers tremendously. \nThe actors try their best. Phoenix is fine; Hoffman overacts a little (as if compensating for his character). Amy Adams deserves better; in some scenes, she seems to be the real brains and leader, but in others she is as meek as the smallest child. She's a very good actress, but it's tough to take a character that behaves erratically when there's no apparent reason for her to do so.\nReportedly, this movie was screened by director Paul Thomas Anderson for noted Scientologist Tom Cruise, with whom the director worked on the dreadful Magnolia. Cruise disputed some parts of the movie. Anderson didn't remove those parts. I don't think removing them would have helped anything.\nIf one were to assume that this was meant as a criticism of Scientology, then one would wonder why it seemed so shallow, focusing so much on two men and their strong wills and so little on the hierarchy of the church. To an outsider, this looks like a movie about a lunatic who either believes he knows The Way or a charlatan who knows he doesn't - and nothing more. It's a movie lacking in substance, with few turning-point scenes and merely repeated conflict.\nIt is not a movie, I believe, that knows what it's meant to be. Any movie that struggles so hard to find its identity, however small, is doomed. It must be something. It must mean something to people. The characters must connect with each other in some way. I saw none of that in this movie. The Master is a stain of a film, a movie that should have been a powerful parallel to a purportedly dangerous cult in real life but instead slips into a sleepy, unresolved mess."}
< {"rating": "7", "date": "22 September 2012", "title_id": "tt0905372", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "It's a prequel! A prequel of good repute!", "content": "This prequel - yes, you read that right - to John Carpenter's 1982 eponymous film is successful both as that movie's ancestor and as a horror film in its own right. There won't be a lot for fans of the original to complain about, as this one neatly segues into the opening scene of the the '82 movie, and newcomers to the plot will be startled, jarred, and invigorated by the amount of visceral violence and pandemonium and paranoia. \nLet me set the stage. A remote outpost in Antarctica in 1982. A paleontologist named Kate Lloyd is recruited by a Dr. Sandor Halvorson to join his group at the outpost, where they've made a remarkable discovery, an alien spacecraft buried in the ice that's apparently been there for 100,000 years or so, give or take a millenia. Shortly after Kate and other visitors arrive at the Norwegian base, the long-frozen body of one of the ship's occupants is found. Note that I said a body was found, not a corpse. But I digress. Soon the scientists and engineers are being picked off one by one in gruesome, bloody, horrific ways. I liked it.\nOne thing I really liked about this movie was that it presented itself as not only a standalone story but also as a backstory to the '82 cult classic. Questions from the earlier film are answered here, as the end of this one moves right into the beginning of the other one. It reminded me a bit of the relation between Alien and Prometheus, although the latter has been disavowed as an actual prequel. Still, a movie that helps explain later events while still providing a lot of terror and exhilarating action on its own is a movie worth watching.\nTo be sure, there are some downsides. A lot of the fight scenes - alien versus man, man versus man - take place in very poorly lit places, making it tough to follow some of the action. Who's winning? Who's arm is that? Did someone already get assimilated? Another problem might be the totality of characters - there are ten on the base when the visitors arrive, and that's a lot of people to track. When one is killed/assimilated, you might have difficulty remembering who that person was and whether you should really care that they're not around anymore. Plus, most of them are Norwegian, although luckily all but one speak English, and there are some other nationalities as well - but not enough for you to think, oh, that's the French guy, or oh, that's the Japanese lady. So some of these deaths sort of blend together.\nMovies like this - Alien, and The Thing (1982) and many others - work off the trope of there being a group of people, isolated from Outside Help, who die one by one. Luckily, writer Eric Heisserer adroitly keeps us guessing as to who is alien and who is not. It'll take more than a blood test to figure out who's a good guy.\nKate is played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, whom I know best from her role as Ramona Flowers in Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World. She was quirky and likable there. Here, she's serious and likable. Sure, there's a point where she makes a discovery and No One Believes Her (duh), but that's hardly Winstead's fault. I think writer Heisserer concentrated less on character development and interaction than on moving the plot along with alien attacks. Which is fine by me.\nPersonally, my bottom line is just this. The 2012 The Thing is close to as good as the original, with an amped-up budget and gorgeous cinematography (for the scenes that aren't in utter darkness, that is). It's an entertaining, tenacious film."}

Neeson is effective as always, the setting is both beautiful and terrifying, and the wolves themselves will turn any heart colder than their home tundra.\nThe men must face four enemies: the wolves, who are smarter than the average bear; the harsh environment; each other; and, of course, their own fears and mortality. Shortly after the plane crashes, it's clear that only Neeson's Ottway has any real leadership abilities. Most of the passengers and crew are dead. The fuselage is torn in two, and pieces of the plane are scattered. Wolves are closing in. \nDirector Joe Carnahan does a serviceable job of moving things along without letting things like backstory get in the way. It's not important who these men have left behind or what they have to live for. It's only important that they survive. And although you get the requisite man-who- doesn't-want-Ottway-to-lead and the man-who's-sort-of-a-nebbish, Carnahan makes it clear that this is Neeson's show. We're permitted to know just enough about each character to empathize with them without getting distracted from the engine driving the plot - their actual survival.\nYou couldn't ask for a better action lead. Neeson has this quality of being able to Lead no matter what the role is without seeming to be just an Action Star. It's tougher than it looks. Harrison Ford is basically an action guy; so is Tom Cruise. They do other stuff, but when you see them in a movie you think of action roles they've had. Not so with Neeson, a wonderfully adaptable actor. Here, he is tough, hard nosed, but in pain. So much pain that he almost doesn't get onto the plane in the first place, if you catch my drift. Hey, living in Alaska for a long period of time would drive me a little crazy, too.\nThe men can't stay near the wreckage, as apparently they've stumbled into the territory of a den of wolves. So trek on they do, in thigh-high snow drifts and with little to protect them. They're roughnecks themselves, more or less, but with a blinding blizzard before them and carnivorous creatures bent on their destruction besetting them on all sides, the odds are not at all in their favor.\nYou have to admit that some of the shots are really astounding. At one point there's a gorge that must be crossed. You or I might think it wiser to walk farther down the edge of the gorge to find a safe place to cross. Not Ottway and crew. They fashion a makeshift rope and shimmy over. Nothing to it. It's either that or the wolves, really, and having already seen the alpha and his crew up close, it's an easy decision for them to make.\nYou know, I liked this movie. I admire tough characters and tough performances, and there's enough action packed into the movie to satisfy the casual fan. The crash itself is brief - not like, say, Alive - and there's no hint of cannibalism. It's more of a fight against expected elements, such as wolves and bitter, blinding cold. I liked the treatment of death, how for some it was a happy embrace as each was escorted by a loved one to somewhere or other. \nAnd Neeson really is terrific. There are some movies in which he looks and acts tough, and then he'll have a tender scene or two to sort of temper things a little. Here he's gutsy, steely, and conflicted. The final scene is perfect."}

When a movie begins with an out-there plot (here, in that people use time as currency in order to live past age 25), it must support that storyline with something that makes the viewer forget how illogical it all is. In Time doesn't quite do that.\nThanks to a helpful plot device called genetic modification, in the future everyone lives to be exactly 25 years old, and then they have one year left (without aging), during which time they must barter, beg, borrow, steal in order to live longer. Weird premise (why would they genetically modify themselves to this end?), but okay. It is what it is, to use a clich\u00e9. Also, the world (city?) has been divided into districts, each well guarded, and each of course set up according to one's class. It's kind of interesting to see one district paying for a bus fare of ten minutes and another one betting one million years in a poker game.\nWill Salas (Justin Timberlake) is from the slums and lives day to day with his mom, played briefly by Olivia Wilde. Will helps a stranger who happens to have a century stored up in him (don't ask how) out of danger in a seedy bar, only to watch helplessly as the same stranger, having donated almost all of his time to Will while the former slept, jump to his death. Naturally, a public camera recorded this, and just as naturally Will is suspected of murder.\nThe rest of the plot is just as simple, really. Will, who's running out of time in more ways than one, kidnaps the daughter of a rich businessman in order to, you know, buy more time. They meet cute, she helps him, and so on. Sure, it's implausible, but don't you know she's a rebel who's been chafing under the constant surveillance from her father? She even has guards in her hoity-toity district!\nYes, it's another fight-the-system-that-keeps-the-proles-in-line movie. It might remind you of The Island, which (despite being directed by Michael Bay) wasn't too bad. It, too, involved genetics and the morality of messing with them. But it's not an altogether favorable comparison. The Island had strong leads (Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson) and strong support from guys like Michael Clarke Duncan and Djimon Hounsou. In Time has Timberlake and, as the kidnapped daughter, Amanda Seyfreid. Seyfried usually plays blondes, leading me to believe she IS blonde, and here she is brunette. Trouble is, she looks like she's wearing a wig. She's not supposed to look like that, is she? Only if you're a hooker should you LOOK like you're wearing a wig. Just my opinion.\nTimberlake is quite good, really, but he's up against what's really a dopey plot under a veneer of sci-fi creativity. The genetics angle is almost absent from the movie - the focus is on how much time people have, how they can get more, time lenders, time stealers, time keepers (like Cillian Murphy, here). Some people desperately want to live forever, hence the wagering of huge durations of time, whereas some, like Will Salas, just want to have enough time to get them through a day. Apparently this makes life more interesting.\nHad this movie any real depth, it would have examined not only the moral implications of generically engineering humans to live only so long (while still allowing for extensions) but also the idea of literally wasting time. Live life to the fullest, make the most of your opportunities, stuff like that. But I didn't get any of that from this film at all. What I got was a lot of running, car chases, gunplay, sexual tension - you know, what you'd find in a typical Hollywood action movie anyway. \nBut this one didn't even reach its low standards. In Time may sound intriguing (ooh! genetic modification!), but it's nothing more than a garden-variety action movie set in yet another dystopian future, pitting the haves versus the have-nots. It's derivative, bereft of twists of any nature. It's, yes, I'll say it, a waste of time."}

Puss in Boots isn't a very good movie. It attempts to cling to the tattered coattails of Shrek an is just good enough to sustain interest for you and your littlest of little ones. It does have good voice acting, but the writing's kind of flat - hardly any jokes, puns, pop-cultural references, etc. - and on the whole it's just not very exciting.\nThis is the tale (ha! pun) of how Puss (Antonio Banderas) came to be, growing up in an orphanage where his only friend was Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galiafanakis). The two spend most of their time trying to find the whereabouts of the magic beans owned, apparently, by Jack and Jill (Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris), who here are bad people. The beans will grow a beanstalk that leads to a giant's castle, where the goose that lays the golden eggs lives. Sort of a mish-mash of fairy tales, but what the heck.\nPuss and Humpty, the little scamps, become thieves in their small border town; when a heist goes wrong, Humpty is left to, er, take the fall, and a bounty is put on Puss' head. That's where the mystique develops - the hat, the boots, the sword, the attitude. Later, as Puss is about to finally get a hold of those magic beans, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) shows up for the same score. But it's totally, okay, because she's a foxy feline, and our hero is a lady killer. As an added bonus, she's a plot contrivance.\nThis is a movie about betrayal, revenge, an reconciliation, so it's really a movie that's about the opposite of different from other animated movies and not a small number of live-action ones. If you cared enough, you could predict each turning point in the film, but you and your kids will be better off just letting that tendency zoom right on by. You'll do yourself no favors by thinking about the plot and how uninventive it is.\nSee, unlike the Shrek movies that spawned it, Puss in Boots has precious few references to fairy tales, which is a shame. Jack and Jill were brother and sister in the old stories, and here they're husband and wife. And bad, bad people. So why even refer to them as Jack and Jill? Then the movie has to confuse Jack of \"and Jill\" fame with the Jack of \"and the Beanstalk\" fame; not the same Jack. That's sort of explained by a cameo by the latter in a prison for no good reason.\nIf you did enjoy the Shrek films - any of them - you're not likely to like this one very much. It lacks all of the charm and wit that helped make the others successful. Okay, so the third Shrek and maybe the fourth were both sort of mediocre, but each is much better than this one, which may as well have been done for television by the old Filmation studio that put out the He-Man cartoons each Saturday."}

It's generally well acted, with a simple and simplistic plot, quick-paced action, and an intentionally disjointed timeline. It's summer fluff that's not without its entertaining moments.\nThe plot centers around the fast-paced world of bike messengers in New York, who apparently still exist. One of them is named Wilee (as in Coyote), played with intent and verve by the talented Joseph Gordon- Levitt. Wilee is asked to pick up an envelope from his alma mater (Columbia Law, of course) and deliver it to Chinatown in 90 minutes. But when a crooked cop (Michael Shannon) tries to intercept the delivery, Wilee quickly discovers this is no ordinary delivery.\nYeah, of course it isn't. Anyway, here's what you need to get straight before you watch this. The bike messengers are the good guys, although they do things that non-bike lovers would dislike - running red lights, weaving in and out of traffic, that sort of thing. Anything to get the package there on time. So in order to buy into the plot, you have to overlook the fact that these guys are really kind of jerks on the road. The other thing is that the cops in this movie are sort of portrayed as bad guys (I mean aside from Michael Shannon), when everything they do is both legal and understandable. You just have to accept that they're obstacles to our protagonists.\nAs I mentioned, the story is told sort of out of order. This can get confusing, although timestamps beginning each scene help. The first scene consists of Wilee crashing to the pavement. Then we learn the events of the previous hour or so. Then we learn some in the so-called present time. Then back to earlier still. Back and forth. It's OK, you get used to it.\nWilee's a daredevil! He rides his bike with no brakes and no gears. This is supposed to make him into some sort of bad-ass, which I'll accept on its face, as I know nothing about bikes. I do know you should have a stopping mechanism of some sort, so I wondered how Wilee managed to stop his bike as often as he did. Maybe he meant there were no handbrakes. Anyway, his adrenaline rush has put a wedge between him and his now-ex, Vanessa (Dania Ramirez), who is now in law school and bike-messengering and is mad at Wilee for his lack to live up to his potential. The usual stuff. So she's now with Wilee's coworker and rival, Manny (Wole' Parks). Anyway, Wilee just gotta be Wilee, you know? He doesn't go in for that suit-wearing stuff, no sir. He's a bit of a nutcase. But of course, he's the best at what he does.\nThings go awry when Wilee refuses to hand the envelope over to Bobby Monday (Shannon), who alternately identifies himself as campus security, NYPD, and IRS. Bobby needs the envelope for his own purposes, and he's got a lot at stake. Once again, a guy just doing his job has gotten in way over his head. But it's the details, such as why everyone needs what's inside this envelope, that are most important. In that, cowriters David Koepp (who directed) and John Kamps did an okay job. We're not talking an overly intricate plot, and thankfully it all does make sense in the end. There are hardly any coincidences, and the explanations are at least plausible, if not earth shattering in their creativity.\nSidenote: throughout the movie, sirens are heard almost incessantly, yet there was only one scene in which a police car with flashing lights was visible. So you'd hear these sirens while Wilee races around NYC, and you expect they're after him. Turns out it's just another day in the big city. The cops who chase Wilee do so either on foot or on bike themselves. \nThere are some terrific action scenes, too. When people climb all over inanimate objects, particularly in an urban environment, it's called parkour. This movie had some, er, bikeour in it. Stunts that are pretty to watch, anyway.\nGordon-Levitt is much better than the material, as is Shannon; Aasif Mandvi (The Daily Show) is memorable as the messenger-service dispatcher/owner. The script lags even if the action doesn't. Wilee makes some decisions that don't make much sense; same for his antagonist-junior, Manny. So perhaps the movie doesn't hold up to real scrutiny, but it's not bad for what it is."}

Unsure of whether reality or insanity is behind the mess, he builds an elaborate storm shelter, much to the chagrin of his devoted wife and the consternation of his friends and neighbors. But lest you think this is simply another end-of-the-world movie, the focus isn't on what's to come, it's on how one deals with what might come.\nCurtis (Michael Shannon) wakes up each morning after horrific nightmares. Motor oil drips from the sky. A huge storm cloud approaches. A flock of birds flies in an odd formation and then attacks Curtis and his daughter. The family dog breaks loose and bites Curtis. All of this is in his dreams, he understands, but each seems to have some sort of real-world effect: blood in his mouth, arm pain, and other maladies. Is Curtis crazy? He literally has no idea, and to make things worse, there's a history of mental illness in his family, as his mother (Kathy Baker) has been hospitalized for many years.\nAs the dreams progress and become more terrifying, Curtis decides to go all in and build his shelter. This is a problem, because daughter Hannah (Tova Stewart), who is deaf, is eligible for an expensive procedure, a cochlear implant. Wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) wonders how Curtis thinks he can afford both the expansive shelter and the medical bills, and I don't blame her.\nCurtis is at war with himself. Is something coming? He has no idea. He's sensible enough to consult his doctor, who refers him to a therapist and gives him medication to help him sleep. But the dreams are still there, and Curtis is convinced something terrible will happen. In his mind, even if he is ill, he must find a way to protect his family.\nShannon shines as the damned Curtis, careening from self-doubt to conviction. He doubts his sanity but is sane enough to seek help. The help isn't quite there, although it's well intentioned. Things snowball when the wife finds out about the money spent on the shelter. But we still don't know if anything's a-coming.\nJessica Chastain, so perfect in the flawed The Tree of Life, is absolutely radiant as the determined, understanding spouse. She's not stupid, she's not a pushover, but neither is she the type who sees only the lie (Curtis's hiding the shelter construction from her) instead of the full picture. She loves her husband unconditionally. She is the the true power in this film.\nThe movie exists on two basic levels. There's the visceral, visual level; Curtis's terrifying nightmares, designed to get under your skin more like a Sam Raimi film, or even David Lynch. And there's the subtle dynamic undercurrent of conflict: man versus self. This is especially wonderful to behold, because Curtis doesn't gradually change from Normal Man to Wacked-Out Man, and it's not a drastic transformation, either. Shannon's interpretation allows Curtis to be both normal and not normal, a Schroedinger's character. He knows something's wrong, but is it within him or without him?\nThe ending is almost superfluous, but it is pitch perfect. We truly do not know, along with Curtis and Samantha, if anything is coming. Surely the town thinks him mad, but we the audience have just enough inside information to know that may not be the case. Or it may be. In either event, minus some minor plot quibbles, Take Shelter is a fascinating and compelling psychological drama."}

It manages to be awesome on several levels \u2013 a frantic action movie, a self-deprecating comedy, and\u0085 okay, that's about it. But still! Explosions that make sense! The mocking of catch phrases! Great casting that doesn't feel forced! Stallone not in the director's chair! Yes, there's so much to like about the movie that we can overlook a lot of clich\u00e9s and hammy performances. Let's look at the plot. Barney Ross (Stallone) and his team, having bilked Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) out of $5 million in the first movie, now have to make amends. No, Church doesn't have them tossed into Gitmo, and he doesn't kill them. Instead, he gives them a mission, the accomplishment of which would make them all even-Steven.\nThe mission involves an infiltration into the jungles of Albania to rescue a secret something (a MacGuffin) from a downed airplane. Things don't go as expected. Ross and his team lose not only the MacGuffin but also one of their own. Tearfully, they vow revenge.\nRoss's team consists of Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), Toll Road (Randy Couture) and Bill the Kid (Liam Hemsworth). Church inexplicably adds another member to their team \u2013 a soldier/intel expert named Maggie (Nan Yu). She may have been the second MacGuffin.\nThe team tracks the bad guys to a series of secret mines in old Russia, where apparently a metric buttload of uranium exists for the taking. The bad guys, led by the well-named Villain (Jean-Claude Van Damme), plan to grab all of the unguarded uranium and, presumably, either hold the world hostage or just blow it up. We're not told, because it hardly matters.\nNow, this may not be the best of films. You won't find a truly intricate plot, even by Mission:Impossible standards. It is what it purports to be: men blowing stuff up with lots of weapons. At least this time there's a woman involved, but you can guess one of the reasons she's there. In any event, the stunts are exhilarating to watch and the action is intense, but what makes the film is the deft, complementary comedy. Church versus Ross. Ross versus Trench (Arnold Schwarzeneggar, yes). Trench versus Church. The movie is, in its entirety, a nod to the mindless action movies of the 80s in which many of these fellas appeared. Catchphrases from those old movies are mocked. Everyone looks bad ass, so much so that you forget that guys like Stallone and Schwarzeneggar are in their sixties.\nIt was exciting to see the oldtimers in the first film, and this one adds some new (old) blood. Hemsworth, although not as ripped as his brother Chris, is terrific. Oh, and did I mention that a certain Chuck Norris is in this? I am not making this up. He's in it. I love how he's referred to as a lone wolf, a nod to his movie Lone Wolf McQuade, or that his character is named Booker, a nod to his movie Good Guys Wear Black. I wish he'd been able to do some martial arts, but the man's 70 years old, so I guess we can cut him some slack.\nThis is a manly man movie. There's a lot of blood, many guns, lots of scars in the making. There is no romance, barely some flirting. You wouldn't expect that, anyway. The Expendables 2 delivers what it promises \u2013 it's a whipped-up frenzied concoction of old-school action movies with a generous sprinkling of creativity (in script and in cinematography).\nSo that's why I liked the movie. Blood, guts, witty repartee, that about does it for me when I want not to think. You won't need to think here. Watch it \u2013 your brain will appreciate the rest."}

Ted is a stuffed bear who magically comes to life when an eight-year-old boy makes a wish while a shooting star passes by (he doesn't seem to know about the star, though). The bear and the boy become best pals, through childhood and into adulthood. You can also think of Ted as an even raunchier episode of Family Guy, or even the short-lived series Greg the Bunny. \nFast forward 27 years, and John (Mark Wahlberg) is now a 35-year-old slouching slacker who's happiest just sitting on his couch getting stoned with, yes, Ted. I mean, the dude does have a job at a car-rental place, but he's clearly going nowhere. He does have one truly awesome thing going for him, though - he's dating Lori (Mila Kunis), who's as down to earth, raw, and crass as Ted and John, so she fits right in. Trouble is, she and John have been dating for four years (!) now, and he's getting the impression that she's ready for more. \nIt's a tug of war. Does John jettison Ted in favor of Lori, who feels (very rightly) that Ted is holding John back. Sort of like how, in the Muppet movie, Amy Adams is a tad uncomfortable with Walter the Muppet coming between her and Jason Segal. Anyway, Lori gives John chance after chance to get his act together. At one point, Ted moves out, into a seedy apartment. Eh, it's okay, though, because there are plenty of hookers around. The bear gets busy, you know what I mean?\nAs with most Seth Macfarlane projects, there is a ton of pop-culture humor. You can't escape it. Some of it works, some of it doesn't work at all; luckily, even some of the bad stuff comes off as self deprecating, as if Macfarlane knows the humor ain't quite there. There's an interesting homage to Airplane! at one point, and it works. \nNow, the reason the Muppet movie could take this approach and make it work was that it was sweetly sentimental, an homage to a bygone era. It was cute and funny and mainly for kids or adults who can't let go of the past. Ted, on the other hand, takes the same approach and just amps up the adult content. You want drugs? Yep. Drink? Yep. Naked women? Of course there's naked women, and there are plenty of references to what Ted (uh huh) can and will do to them. It's weird, it's creepy, and it's expected.\nThe plot itself is pedestrian. Everyone needs someone. Ted needs John, John needs Ted, John needs Lori, Lori needs John. Ted leaves, John feels bad, Ted convinces John to party, Lori finds out, Lori leaves John, Ted gets kidnapped... oh yes, there's a kidnapping, too, with a seedy dad (Giovanni Ribisi) and his needy kid. It's a side plot that's really unnecessary except to give us a car chase and a race up the Green Monster at Fenway Park. \nHave I given too much away? Of course not. The plot isn't that big of a mystery, anyway; it's the jokes you come for. Okay, let me put it this way. If you like Family Guy but always felt the creators (Macfarlane) were holding back because of TV censors, then you'll find plenty of laughs here, scattered though they may be. If you've never been a Family Guy fan, you probably won't get into this too much anyway. Sometimes the pop references are funny on their own but make zero logical sense. For example, Ted at one point brags about having met Norah Jones at a Belinda Carlisle party and having sex with her in a closet. Considering how close Ted and John are supposed to be throughout the movie, it really isn't likely that the teddy bear would be off at Hollywood parties while the human is stuck in Boston. Yes, you read me right. I accept a talking stuffed animal, but that's it.\nIf I were to pick just one thing that I loved about the movie, though, it would be the ethereal-yet-humanistic Mila Kunis, who makes for a terrific girlfriend. She's not a caricature (a bit of a surprise); she doesn't demand things from John, hates to issue ultimata (but of course does have to), can joke as nastily as her male counterparts, and is an all-around good person with real feelings, characteristics I wouldn't expect to see in a Seth Macfarlane movie. Maybe it's to make up for all of the crap Kunis' character Meg takes on Family Guy (never seen such a hated character). In any event, Kunis is terrific, better than the material, by far the best part of the entire movie. It's nice to be beautiful, I'm sure, but it's wonderful to be talented.\nTed was never meant to be for everyone, that's for sure. You love raunch, well, then this movie is drenched in raunch dressing. And off- color, non-PC jokes. Some of it is painfully unfunny (who thought having Mark Wahlberg sing was a good idea). Some of the scattered references do stick a little, so it's not a wasted effort - as long as you count yourself among the intended audience."}

Anonymous's premise is that it was the Earl of Oxford, Edward De Vere, who penned the classics and used, indirectly, Shakespeare as a front for the performance of his work. But even if you buy that premise - and it is not essential that you do - the movie is overplotted, dark, and dreary, but with terrific performances by Rhys Ifans, Vanessa Redgrave, and others.\nIt seems Edward has all of these plays that he's been writing, to his wife's consternation, and he wants to see them performed. But plays are not held in high esteem in London in the late 1500s; to avoid sullying his family name, the Earl provides a local playwright named Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto), of whom the more learned of you may have heard. Jonson has his own troupe perform one of the plays, the audience goes crazy, loves it, and so all is good. Except when young Jonson is arrested for sedition, because of course anything that makes the nobility look bad is by definition seditious. And so it goes.\nAll right, so there's conflict. Class versus class. The place of poetry and of creativity in general in society. Did I mention the French also have designs on the throne of Queen Elizabeth I (Vanessa Redgrave) as well? Oh yes, it's one of those movies. Everyone seems to be angling for something, sort of the norm for costume period dramas. I like that, to a point. Intrigue is good. And this is also one of those movies in which everyone seems to be sleeping with someone they shouldn't be, or at least knows about someone in that position, which leads to blackmail, which represents the plot of every British period drama ever, basically.\nOverall, the acting is fine, particularly by Ifans and Redgrave (but of course). Most of the rest of the cast, although competent, is dispensable, even the character of Shakespeare himself. Jonson's more interesting, and Armesto is sufficient, but he's no Sir John Mills. Or Sir Paul McCartney, really, but he tries. There's no hamminess, which is nice, but the passion is relegated to the leads and the leads alone. \nSome caveats. For one thing, although London of the period is basically a muddy city, I don't recall seeing anyone with a speck of dirt on them. OK, sure, the nobility gets to walk on half-foot-wide planks to avoid the mud, but still. No mud? Seriously? And no one has a hair out of place, even under the rotten, unsanitary conditions. Also: way too many characters. Picture this: It's dark, it's gloomy, it's dirty, and all of the men look the same. Someone would rush into a scene, breathlessly importing news of, well, import, and everyone in the scene would instantly recognize him. And I'd be like, \"Have we met?\" I couldn't keep track of them all.\nAnd it wasn't just the characters. There are too many plots. Who wrote the plays? That would have been a nice plot to stick with, and instead of giving us the answer in the first ten minutes, leave it as a - stay with me, now - twist at the end. Then you don't get bogged down with endless prattling about the queen doing this and the earls doing that and ships and swords and why are there guns when other people have swords and on and on.\nWell, you get what you pay for, sort of. The sly ones look sly, the foppish ones look foppish, the witty ones try to be witty, and the queen wears the weirdest makeup in the history of painted faces. In this case, the movie's the thing, wherein we don't even see a king. That's a bad play on words. Let me try again. This movie shouldn't have stopped at being titled \"Anonymous\"; it should have been written by Anonymous as well. I'm making it out to be worse than it probably is, because period pieces aren't my bag (unless they're Dangerous Liasions), so for the sake of fairness I am adding a half star to the review."}

It's mysterious, exciting fun. I can't put it more elegantly. There's mountains of tension, ulterior motives galore, and once again some of the finest supporting acting in the business.\nSome time has passed since the events of The Dark Knight. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) spends his days brooding as only Batman can. He's taken the fall for the misdeeds of Harvey Dent and has therefore stayed out of the spotlight. But when a new supervillain takes Gotham by terroristic storm, the Bat must come out of his, er, cave and right some wrongs - some much more psychological than others.\nBane (Tom Hardy) is a giant of a man who wears what looks like a cross between Darth Vader's helmet and a WW II gas mask. Apparently he needs it to breathe. What's more important is that he's out to destroy Gotham. Why? Well, it's just one of the tidbits you discover during the film that fit into the larger puzzle. Bane has a destiny to fulfill, as does Batman.\nOn a lower level, the new DA Foley (striving for commissioner) is knocking heads with the perpetually in-danger Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) while being upstaged by the tyro cop Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Plus there's a cat burglar (meow) named Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), who makes Michelle Pfeiffer's version seem like Little Lulu from the comics (ask your grandparents).\nWayne Enterprises isn't doing so well, either, not with its wonderboy in seclusion. It does, however, have a huge energy-saving device, destined to change the world. The device, designed by one Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard), is shut down by Bruce, once he learns that it could be weaponized. That would be bad, as it has a nuclear core.\nThe plot is full of twists, the good kind. I don't like it much when something unexpected happens that simply doesn't make a lot of sense or is obviously shoehorned into the plot for no good reason. Surprises are great, as long as they're plausible, and this one has then by the bat-load. Well, a lot of bat-loads.\nOf course, there's plenty of action, and any time there's a woman in a tight catsuit riding a motorcycle, I think you have a winner. Helps when that woman is Anne Hathaway. Anyway, some great set pieces, particularly one on a football field that's already been seen by everyone who watched the trailer, but it still rocks.\nStandouts abound among the cast: Hathaway is cunning and sexy; Cotillard is elusive, handy, compassionate. Hardy is as his name indicates; he's a monster of a man with more than a touch of intellect and cleverness. He looks like a circus strongman but with the showmanship of a magician and the sense of forensic psychologist. Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and especially Michael Caine turn in some of the very best work.\nChristian Bale is Christian Bale. Never liked him much in the first two in this Bat-series, but he is improved this time around. Good thing, because there's more to Batman than simply punching people in the eye. He's supposed to be the crafty type. He should be a good actor, what with being Bruce Wayne as well. Bale, who really is a terrific actor anyway, raises his Batman level a couple of notches and should be lauded.\nI mentioned there were twists. I won't explain them here, but I did love how those twists dovetailed logically with events from the previous two films. That's good writing. Sometimes a twist is thrown in just to mess with the audience. Here the twists confirm foreshadowing or even introduce exposition where it's sorely needed.\nThe ending is a nice touch. It's bittersweet, playing the audience for keeps, and it works splendidly. The Dark Knight Rises is a brilliant coda to a troika of uneven films. It is perhaps the most humanistic of the three. Batman is, more than ever, a human with some special abilities, but even he cannot survive happily without the family and friends he's made along the way. Nolan (and his brother Jonathan) have done a typically fantastic job."}

Thompson, but about the only thing that the movie has in common with a Thompson novel is that the protagonist drinks a lot. This is a tepid, sluggish film that isn't quite the rabble-rousing, iconoclastic story it desperately wants to be. Johnny Depp made a fine Thompson stand-in in the otherwise-disappointing Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, but here he's so sedate that he might as well be channeling Judge Reinhold. Depp plays American journalist Paul Kemp, who's sent to Puerto Rico to work on a third-rate newspaper in the late 1950s. The paper's run by the devious Lotterman (Richard Jenkins), who warns Kemp against drinking to excess. Kemp falls in with a kindred spirit in photog Sala (Michael Rispoli) and a necessary damsel-in-distress named Chenault (Amber Heard). He's quickly recruited by an ex-newspaperman named Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart), who wants Kemp to write up glowing brochures for him and his monied pals, who hope to exploit a neighboring island for tourism.\nAt this point, you may be assuming that the Sanderson and newspaper angles will connect. That's a reasonable assumption, but the connection is nearly superfluous. It just plain doesn't matter; we wind up with two story lines that diverge and converge when the plot demands they do so. Kemp and Sala have wild adventures, such as ducking out on paying for a meal when they think they're going to get killed, but their adventures aren't anything new, and neither actor rises above the mess to make lemonade out of the sour script.\nI waited patiently for Depp to go into Jack Sparrow mode, wherein he just chucks his lines out the window and elevates the proceedings. Didn't happen. You could have cast Eckhart as the journalist and Depp as the bad guy and it would have made little difference. Speaking of Eckhart, hasn't he done far too many of these smarmy, elitist roles? We get it, he makes for a good-looking cad.\nThe movie tracks as if a child wrote it. If you're looking for some subversion, forget it. Even the ending seems like it's from a cut-rate, bargain-basement thriller. I haven't read the novel, but if this is how Thompson's early work played out it's a wonder he got anything else published (as it was, it was published late in his career despite being written decades earlier). Every character is written thinner than tissue paper, and all Depp can do is raise an eyebrow or, more likely, a glass. It's a sad movie that aims low and doesn't quite reach that pinnacle. It does get some points for pretty scenery, though (such as Amber Heard)."}

It has its scary parts, like most Disney movies, but the five year old who saw the movie with me wasn't scared one bit, so you probably won't be, either. But I don't know, she's kind of tough. \nMerida (voice of Kelly Macdonald) is the first-born princess in a mythical Scotland kingdom. Unlike most princesses, though, Merida is feisty, passionate, and more willing to shoot a bow and arrow than to be a demure little lady. Sort of the opposite of what her strict mother, Queen Elinor (voice of Emma Thompson) desires. \nThe feud between headstrong mother and child comes to a head when the former announces there will be a huge party attended by the three other major clans, the head of each bringing along his first-born son to offer to Merida as a husband. It's tradition, of course. That tradition gets upended by Merida's unyielding will, and in her desperate defiance of her mother she encounters a witch (Julie Walters) who grants her a spell that will change Merida's destiny. Not an uncommon theme in these movies; the trouble is that the characters never seem to understand that changing a destiny doesn't mean it's changed for the better. In this case, Merida's destiny - not a spoiler here - is changed in that her mother becomes a bear. Hilarity ensues.\nAll curses in movies, particularly in animated movies, have some kind of loophole. Here, it's that if Merida can repair a certain bond before two sunrises, she can reverse the spell; otherwise, dear old mum will be a bear forever. For a queen who hardly ever ventures outside her enormous castle, this is quite the fish-out-of-water dilemma.\nFrom an animation standpoint, Brave is elegant without being too flashy. It doesn't try to be overly realistic, with a tremendous attention to detail, like the earlier Pixar films had. Truth be told, the movie has much more of an old-time, traditionally animated Disney film than a new- wave Pixar movie. The movie is presented in 3D and in 2D, and I recommend the latter - if only because there are many dark scenes (in a forest, mostly) that will be rendered indiscernible in 3D, which vacuums light up. Some of the forest scenes are very pretty indeed, specifically those involving the appearance of the will o' the wisp, a spirit that helps Merida find that which she seeks. \nThe movie is not without its fair share of humor, even slapstick. Merida's father, the King (voice of Billy Connolly) is a rough-and- tumble, huge, no-necked man who's just as soon drink a gallon of ale with you than break your nose. He's also missing a leg, the tale of which he never tires of telling, to the chagrin of his family. Merida also has three little brothers who, being boys, get away with anything they wish, while the poor princess must conform to strict rules of order. Ain't no fun being a princess, apparently.\nBrave is a modest movie by Pixar standards, but its plot is a little more enriched than those of its predecessors, with myths, legends, and oral traditions leading the way to, in some cases, more questions. Well, more questions if you're eight years old and want to know more about everyone's intentions. If you are eight years old and are reading this, congratulations - our schools has made you a learny person. In any event, the plot is simple on the surface but contains deeper layers of provocative intrigue, never a bad thing. Kids will either gloss over the details or will find them fascinating."}

It's provocative, touching, and masterful, and much of its success is due to the unerring, passionate performance by star Brit Marling, who co-wrote the movie with director Mike Cahill.\nOn the very day that a planet that appears to mirror our own in every physical way, a teenager who has just been accepted to MIT carelessly crashes her car into another, killing a woman and her son and leaving the husband/father in a deep coma. Four years later, having served her time, the young lady attempts to show her contrition to the survivor, who does not know her identity. Her plan does not run as scheduled.\nLosing her nerve, Rhoda (Marling) opts instead to pose as a worker from a cleaning service, and John (William Mapother) agrees to let her clean his house as part of a \"free trial\"; he keeps her on while she tries to find a delicate way of informing him of her true identity. Meanwhile, Rhoda - who had been gazing at the new Earth at the time of the crash - enters a contest to win a seat on a voyage to the newly discovered planet.\nBut bear this in mind: this is not about traveling in space. Another Earth, through Rhoda, tells us to look within ourselves rather than outward to space; what is it about ourselves that makes us unique? We learn in the movie that we have a twin on the twin planet. Does that twin know about us? Do they share our memories? What would you say if you met yourself? \nMarling is unforgettable as the troubled Rhoda, a woman who gave up so much promise in the blink of an eye. Her guilt is so burdensome, so nerve wracking, that she feels compelled to explain her unforgivable action to John. But because she cannot bring herself to do so, she tries to make his life a little better. (When she reenters his life as a house cleaner, he is wallowing in depression, cut off from the world and living in squalor.) Rhoda herself is numb after four years behind bars, voluntarily avoiding contact with people to the greatest possible extent. She appears to be self loathing (understandably). She has not only shattered her own dreams, she has destroyed a family and ended two lives. She seeks redemption, even if she believes she is undeserving. \nThe characterization may have come off as maudlin if it weren't for Marling. I really couldn't tell she was a novice (her only previous feature was back in 2009, and she played a character named Brit). I didn't feel sorry for Rhoda - I felt empathy for her plight. She seems like a nice young lady whose personality has undergone a seismic change. Even when she cannot summon up the courage to confess to John, I understood. Rhoda is not a character we are presumed to dislike, but she is sufficiently complicated that we do not simply root for her by default.\nSide note - look for a fascinating scene in which John, a composer, displays his prowess at playing a handsaw. Yes, a saw. The twangs of the vibrations are so elegant and diverse that they sound utterly symphonic. The music was played by the talented Natalia Paruz.\nThe cinematography, whether it's a scene shot inside John's house or outside looking at Earth 2, is beautiful, offering an atmosphere that has charisma all its own. There is a tremendous shot of Rhoda, alone at dusk, gazing up at this exquisite new planet that's possibly teeming with life. It's a stunning visual metaphor for man's place in the universe, perhaps: an insignificant speck amazed by the wonders around it while remaining in ignorance of the capacity within it."}

It combines elements of every medical drama you've ever seen with every animals-in- peril movie you've ever seen. The result is a dishonest, amorphous pile.\nThe movie is actually a prequel to the Apes movies we all know and love (or not). How did the apes come to rule the planet? Well, here's the thing. You might not get an answer to that from this film at all. I'm sure the creative minds behind it thought that Rise would eventually lead to several more Apes movies, with maybe the next one bridging this one and the Planet of the Apes movie with which we're all familiar. But if one takes this movie at face value, it's a standard-issue, clich\u00e9d film and nothing more, no matter what it aspires to lead into. \nJames Franco plays a scientist searching for a cure for Alzheimer's, with which his dad (John Lithgow) is afflicted. He thinks he's got the right medicine when one - yes, one - chimp shows remarkable cognitive abilities after receiving the drug. This is more than enough for Franco's Will Rodman to show off the primate to investors so that they can provide more money for Phase II, which naturally is when the ape goes, well, ape and destroys the lab.\n(Yes, I'm using ape, chimp, primate, and so on interchangeably. It's more fun than writing \"chimp,\" even when it's completely inaccurate.)\nI'll say this much for sure - the chimps have great personality, more than any of the humans. Andy Serkis plays the central character, Caesar, and by play I mean move about so that the CGI will match up, which is sort of like acting only not. Caesar, who quickly becomes too smart for his own good (he's the son of the chimp who destroyed the lab), engineers an escape from the two-legged meanies who are holding him, with the help of a giant ape, an orangutan, and other assorted nonhumans.\nIt's almost a Disney movie. In fact, it's similar to that overlooked Matthew Broderick movie, Project X, in which Broderick tries to save chimps who are undergoing some testing of their own. But beyond the facts that there are apes involved and that we've been informed this is a quasi prequel, the movie has very little in common with the actual Planet of the Apes movies. Because of that, it feels much more like a standard action/drama. With chimps. \nThe whole thing feels like a setup. Most of the movie deals with Caesar growing up as a ward/son to Rodman, who of course meets cute with a zoo vet (Freida Pinto) and bonds with everyone. The \"rise\" part of the movie doesn't occur until far into the movie. Luckily, the charm of the fascinating nonhuman characters maintains the interest level a little bit. But only just.\nIf you make it to the end (no spoiler here), you might be disappointed. The \"rise\" feels almost tacked on, as if someone suddenly remembered that the primates were supposed to be rebelling against The Man, or something. We never wind up any closer to knowing how the world became the planet of the apes than we were when the movie began, and for that reason it felt like a big waste of time and talent."}

It's an unfortunate mishmash of sci-fi and western, rather than a cohesive mashup of same, that's just riddled with clich\u00e9d writing and acting. You won't want to suspend your disbelief so much as bungee jump it off the Burj Khalifa. Its plot barely works within the narrow confines of its dominant genre (western), and it offers one-note performances and even shallower special effects.\nA man (Daniel Craig) awakes in the middle of Arizona in 1873 with a metal bracelet on his arm that just won't come off, making it one heck of a lousy accessory. He knows nothing of himself or where he is. But that's okay, because after quickly dispatching three gunmen who figure him for a runaway convict, he heads to the closest town, where he gets himself into trouble by kicking the son of the local Big Man squarely in the cojones.\nYou might be wondering where the aliens enter into this. Well, soon as our mystery man and the scion/scourge are locked in a wagon to take them to Santa Fe (not sure why, since they're in Arizona and not New Mexico), aliens attack. They send out these robotic tentacles that grab various, mostly dispensable townsfolk and take them into their little scout ships. Our mystery man is able to destroy one, though, thanks to that nifty jewelry. Neat gadget, that. \nThe arrival of the spaceships befuddles the town, including local bad guy/Big Man Colonel Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford), one of those typical iron-fisted, \"I gave you your job!\" yo-yos who feel that they own the town, which they often do. With perpetually gritted teeth and the occasional sneer, Ford tries very, very hard to be the bad guy, but he's just not that good of an actor. It hurt to type that. He's a terrific actor and makes a great hero, but he can't do evil. Then again, the movie's title might indicate that he's not the focal bad guy anyway, right?\nNo one knows quite what to make of the spaceships arrival and quick disappearance, so everyone does what comes natural and rounds up a posse to track them down. It's quite a posse, with Dolarhyde, our now-named hero Lonergan, a woman gunslinger (Olivia Wilde), a kid, some old fellers, a Native American (Adam Beach, who is always stuck with that role), and a dog. \nThe movie itself isn't terribly noteworthy, as it takes the blandest, most-repeated aspects of each genre and beats them to death very slowly. Putting aliens in a wild-West setting is creative; doing nothing with that premise is a magnificent failure. The aliens, as bad as they may be, are hardly even seen until the third act, as much of the plot has to do with the unbending Dolarhyde and the taciturn Lonergan at loggerheads. \nIt's another one of those movies where Harrison Ford has lost someone dear to him, whether it's his wife (Frantic), his dad (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade), or even his entire family (Firewall). Here, it's his shiftless son, played by Paul Dano. For all of his efforts to find his boy, Dolarhyde spends little time interacting with him or even talking about him. For the Colonel, it's all about running things and getting results. This is more of a Gene Hackman role than a Harrison Ford role. Ford's effort here varies between constipated and ineffectual, depending on the needs of the plot.\nThe rest of the cast isn't bad. Craig isn't asked to do much other than look menacing and dish out some punishment, and he does both well. Wilde's job is to look pretty and reveal a big secret. Sam Rockwell is the town doctor, a nebbish who (why not) must learn to shoot a gun while on the trail. \nI won't blame you if you don't pardon this pun, but the movie is a misfire. It does have some real ugly aliens, though. But they seem easily thwarted, if you catch my drift. But a lot of things in the movie just didn't make enough sense to sustain the creaky plot, anyway."}

This dark, energetic, and unnerving thriller takes us to the purported point of human creation. It's as epic as the hype made it out to be, backed by a fluid, mysterious mythology and a passing nod to not only Alien itself but also to 2001: A Space Odyssey.\nIt's 2093, and man has discovered the same cave painting (predating known human existence) in remote locations across the globe. They take it as an invitation to visit other planets, although you or I may take it another way. They've pinned down where they think the creators of these drawings and have zoomed off on a long, long, cryogenically enhanced journey to meet their Makers.\nLike the Nostromo in Alien, the Prometheus is populated with an array of interesting characters. The scientific expedition is led by Drs. Shaw and Holloway (Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green) and includes engineers, biologists, and geologists. The captain of the ship is Janek, played by Idris Elba. The commander is Charlize Theron, and - as with most Alien movies - there's a nonhuman, David, played by Michael Fassbender.\nWe join the crew as the ship arrives at its destination, an unnamed moon in a far-off solar system. This, they think, is where those long-ago visitors originated. They plan to, uh, talk to them. You know, sort of rap with them to find out why they abandoned them and so forth. \nAlmost nothing goes right. The mission is funded by the Weyland Corporation (its long-dead owner gives the crew a message via hologram), but it's possible that its agenda and that of the scientists aren't a complete match. I guess it's safe to say that everyone finds more than they bargained for. \nShaw and Holloway desperately want to be right - one for the sake of scientific bragging, the other because of more spiritual, internalized reasons. Personally, if I were in their shoes I'd be questioning why I was on the mission (even if I had discovered all the cave paintings) and if my benefactor had any ulterior motives. These are some trusting scientists, is what I'm getting at here.\nThe movie is dark, which begs the question of why anyone in his or her right mind would pay money to see it in 3D. 3D absorbs light. If you have a dark scene shot in 3D, it will be even darker. And you're in a dark room. Poor foolishness. That's why I saw it in plain ol' 2D. The movie looked terrific, from the bulky, craggy surface of the moon to the tight-fitting chambers within it, mimicked to some degree by the interior of the ship itself. \nThe best sci-fi includes answers that lead to more questions, and Prometheus is no exception. We know about as much as the scientists know and almost nothing of what Commander Vickers knows. The plot takes some twists that are both plausible and unexpected, and the action scenes are impeccable. Everything adds to the mythos of the Alien universe, but as soon as we learn something - something else doesn't quite add up. Not in the illogical sense but in the sense that there is so much more that our characters (and we) just don't yet know. And that's good storytelling. We identify with certain aspects of most of the characters, even the cyborg David, and that means we manipulate with and are manipulated by them in turn. \nIt's a majestic movie, especially for one with so many scenes set in confined quarters. Technology, innovation, and creativity, with scarce use of CGI, are on display here. There may not be a scene that's quite the equal of the notorious chest-bursting scene from the original, but trust me when I note that there are plenty of close substitutes, including a couple of pulse-pounding death scenes. \nThe acting is universally excellent. Theron has a tough role as the icy commander with a lot on her mind, but she pulls it off without seeming too detestable. Elba makes for a fine paradox, a laid-back daredevil. Rapace is a truly wonderful find as the gritty heroine. Guy Pearce shows up, although you won't recognize him. But they all take a back seat to Fassbender, who follows quite expertly in the shoes of Ian Holm; in fact, he surpasses Holm's fine earlier work. Fassbender's David is both intelligent and empathetic, even though he lacks feelings himself. He is at the center of all the subterfuge in this film, circles around circles of deceit.\nPrometheus is certainly one of the best in the Alien series, surpassed perhaps only by the second one (Aliens plural). It includes stunning visual effects, a taut, brainy storyline, humanized performances, and an eye-opening denouement."}

Its core audience will like it, probably quite a bit. It's certainly better than most big-budget raunch films out there today, even with its unlikely plot. Or probably because of it. There's a lot of barfing, there is drug use, precious little nudity, and plenty of laughs.\nFinn (Eric Toms) is a longtime college student who rarely goes to class. He's also run through several roommates over the years, ostensibly because his wild antics drive them away. The resident assistant despises him. So do his professors. He spends most days at the only bar in town that opens before noon. He's the ne'er-do-wells to end all ne'er-do- wells.\nHis new roomie is Toby (Todd Gaebe), a teen prodigy who would make Wormser from the Revenge of the Nerds movies look like Ruby Rhod from The Fifth Element. Toby is terrified of everything, especially his dad (Richard Moll), who doesn't understand his brainy offspring much at all. Finn doesn't help matters by essentially making Toby sleep under the bed while he (Finn) brings home college girl after college girl. It's a scarring experience.\nSince this is a comedy, we can rest assured that all will turn out well in the end, and it doesn't matter that we know that. We expect there to be some sort of reconciliation between the two (one makes the other less wild, one makes the other less timid). He expect a growing of character, if not outright development. And we expect some climactic scene in which bad guys, probably jocks, are outplayed in some fashion. We are not disappointed.\nToms is the one who holds it all together. The effortless charm is at just the right level. Too much of it, and a character seems smarmy, self-promoting, and unappealing. Not enough of it, and the character can just disappear into the scenery, not something you want your lead to do. Toms manages to make Finn be both likable and unlikeable. He accomplishes this by being funny, getting the most out of writer Charles Price's script.\nThe movie is low budget, surprising because of the multitude of songs on the soundtrack. And yet each song is well chosen and adds to a scenes atmosphere, rather than distracting from it. Sure, occasionally one is used for a montage - a staple of this kind of movie - but that's the exception. Regardless, the movie doesn't feel like a low-budget movie at all. It has the look and feel of a studio film, if that studio had any idea about how to make a funny college-kids movie.\nDisOrientation doesn't waste time with a complicated plot and wisely lets Toms (and Gaebe) carry the load. The movie is endearing, sure (all college-kids movies must have some heart), but it's also terrifically disgusting and hilarious. The drinking contest alone is a minor comedy gem."}

Because he has a pushy dad, that's why.\nThings go wrong just as they did in the first one in that, after enjoying a toast on the beach, the friends wake up in some hellhole, this time in Bangkok. They then spend the rest of the film figuring out where they are, where the teenager is, and how to save the wedding - again, somewhat of a repeat of the first film.\nRaunchy movies can be a lot of fun, but this one offers very little in terms of wit, just blustery Americanisms (such as yelling louder at someone who might not understand English). Some fun is poked at the seedy underbelly of Bangkok itself and at culture clash in general, but it's an impotent mess. There's much racing about madly as the characters dash from scene to scene. In this case, that may have helped the movie, as one didn't have time to contemplate the implausible plot too much.\nLet's look at some good parts. Paul Giamatti has a quick, showy role as a crime boss and does well. Mike Tyson sings and shows some personality. That's about it. The rest might make you cringe - if you had cared enough about the characters to begin with.

Smart move, because that guy was boring (he was the \"lost one\" they had to find in the previous film).\nI suppose if you got really drunk and didn't care about anything more than a moving picture, you might find this endurable. Or maybe you could make a drinking game out of it - every time a monkey did something interesting, take a shot. Other than that, it's worthless."}

I think Kung Fu Panda 2 surpasses the original, and it's because it introduces some heretofore unseen layers of Po while combining some contrasting animation styles. It's expertly directed by Jennifer Yuh and features the returning voices of Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, and others.\nIn this installment, the Dragon Warrior panda Po (Black) is now teamed with the Furious Five, defending the town from evil doers. Exposition tells us of the banished son of the old king and queen, peacocks, who became prideful and menacing, and now he's back to avenge his parents' treatment of him and to take over China - and, by extension, the world. This son, Shen (Gary Oldman) plans to do this by using fireworks as weapons to usher out the era of kung fu. Meanwhile, Po comes to realize that he is not the natural son of his father, the goose (James Hong). Don't ask why this is news.\nDuring flashbacks, we get to see what tiny snippets of Po's childhood emerge in his subconscious. He was placed by his mother in a pot of radishes and found by Mr. Ping (Hong). But why was he left there? What happened to his parents? Does Shen hold some of the answers? Probably. For - not a spoiler - it has been foretold that Shen will be defeated by a black-and-white warrior, by the local soothsayer (Michelle Yeoh). Shen knows this, Po does not. \nSo much to like about this movie. In those flashbacks, Yuh uses an entirely different style of animation, mostly black and white, to underline the intensity of the scenes. It's reminiscent of the O-Ren Ishii's flashback scenes in Kill Bill, come to think of it. Dazzling and detailed, these scenes are emotional and provocative. A little more than you'd expect from a kids' film, but trust me when I say that the scenes are well done and by no means dwell on violence. They're tense, but not truly intense.\nPo himself takes on a role exuding more confidence and leadership. He's not just a bumbling panda this time around. He is a little quicker, a little smarter, although just as unwieldy and ungainly. He lends the team both clear vision and witty repartee. Although he's just as big as ever, he's become more agile and more thoughtful, more inclined to listen to Master Shifu (Hoffman) and Tigress (Jolie) than before. This makes the action scenes - and there are some terrific ones - honestly compelling.\nIt's nice to see everyone resuming their old roles, even if actors like David Cross, Jackie Chan, and Lucy Liu get short shrift (someone has to). It's Po's story. Importantly, I never felt as if this was an example of stunt casting, as each actor seems to be fitting for his or her role. \nBe warned, though - the movie, like most animated films, does have its hankie moments. Here, they come at the very end, and they are as beautiful and touching as the rest of the film is charming and invigorating. The denouement offers a fitting coda for this masterful film."}

It's appropriately claustrophobic, but the cheesy special effects and humdrum plot offset any suspense or thrills. Its intriguing premise - asking why man hasn't returned to the moon lately - is done in by implausible scenarios, even by sci-fi standards.\nThis is a found-footage film, and everything that happens in it is captured by some camera or other, whether on the moon, the orbiter, or the lander. That adds to the verite' component and involves us, as if we're peeking in on someone's personal videos. The idea is that man DID return to the moon, on the Apollo 18 mission, but it was a super-secret mission. So secret that, apparently, even the three-man crew wasn't told why they had been sent into outer space. Imagine their surprise when they find out. The trouble is that you will probably find out before them.\nI warmed to the idea at first. Okay, they're up there following orders, just like the HAL 9000, except they're not getting conflicting commands, just not all the information. I'd like to think that a commander of a space mission would be privy to that information, but I guess when the Department of Defense is involved (and why didn't that set off alarms right away?), you don't get to know everything. \nIt is not a spoiler to inform you that when our American astronauts reach the moon, they find that they're not alone. And that their communications have been disrupted by some unidentifiable noise. They can hear transmissions from Mission Control, but apparently their own transmissions don't make it off the orbiting spheroid, even to their orbiter. Curious, indeed. If you were stranded on the moon with no way to contact anyone, you might get a little panicky. Our two astronauts, though, are professionals and don't scare easily. That is, until they run into an obvious shocking moment - obvious in the sense that you expect it and are surprised that they don't. Any time a character wanders into a dark area, the audience tenses up, knowing full well that something's jumping out at someone. \nWriter Brian Miller, with his first feature, does do an admirable job in keeping everyone on their toes, the occasional clich\u00e9 notwithstanding, and where I think he really excelled was in not explaining everything, to either the audience or to the characters. Some ambiguity is perfectly okay; unanswered questions make us think. This movie does not come with a tidy bow on it, that's for sure.\nThe real problem is that the plot develops a lot more slowly than you'd think an 86-minute movie would. Then, when things happen, they happen so quickly - and murkily, as dark as it can be on the moon - that neither the characters nor the audience has time to process the new information, much less react. Quick cutaway shots, spots of blood, madness caused by internal or external stimuli, all come too quickly and leave too quickly. When I say that some ambiguity is okay, I mean it; don't introduce a plot device and then discard it. I want some answers, just not all of them.\nYou may be wondering why I haven't mentioned the acting. The acting is fine. The actors are not developed any more than is absolutely necessary; oblique references to life back on Earth don't color in their outlines very much. The two main American astronauts are played by an Irishman and an Englishman, although with perfectly nice American accents, so it's all good. They're not there for their fine acting skills. The screenplay is too straightforward and generic to allow anyone to stretch their muscles. \nThis movie doesn't know what it really wants to be. There have been many excellent cerebral sci-fi movies, and there have been many excellent sci- fi thrillers with lots of action. This one offers small portions from both category, and in the end that's just plain not enough. It's gruel instead of stew."}

It's modestly interesting, but none of the characters - including, fatally, the protagonist - have even a nanometer of depth to them, and ultimately this is a by-the-numbers action movie that's hardly different from any other film with a revenge motif.\nThe little girl is named Cataleya, which the film informs me is the name of a type of orchid but that Wikipedia tells me is made up for the film, that the actual flower is named cattleya. This isn't important for the purposes of the movie, unless you're the sort of person who's bothered that the person Cataleya leaves, as her trademark, a cattleya flower. At any rate, after witnessing her parents' killings, Cataleya finds her way from Bogota to Chicago through the wonderful magic of montage, where she meets her Uncle Emilio (Cliff Curtis), who agrees to train her in the ways of contract killers as long as she goes to school. Hey, at least he has a moral code.\nThe grown Cataleya is played by Zoe Saldana, who's really a good actress disguising herself here as an action-movie prop. It's not her fault that her character is amoral to the point of cruelty; she does the best she can with what she has, as does Curtis. Cataleya kills for profit, people whose names are supplied to her by good old Uncle Emilio, with her endgame being the demise of the drug lord who ordered her parents' deaths. You probably figured that already, because you're smart. You are probably too smart for this movie.\nWhat drives Cataleya? That's something we know. But why is she so amoral? It's not explained. Cataleya (or Jen, as she tells her sometime- beau she's called) is simply a killing machine. Doesn't matter how old or how young or how imperiled her victims are, they all die, and on screen. I suppose that's to show how tough Cataleya is, but I'm not sure it's necessary. Saldana has a way of looking at someone that makes one wish you hadn't crossed her path. Here, her character is definitely no better than a low-rent Batman, except Cataleya isn't saving a city or its citizens, she's just mowing them down.\nIn the fifteen years since the murders, Cataleya becomes not only an excellent shot with all manner of weaponry, she's a skilled martial artist and deceiver. In one clever, amusing scene she allows herself to get arrested just so she can break out of her cell, kill a bad guy (and others), then slip back into her cell. Presumably Uncle Emilio taught her everything she would ever need to know. Which begs the question of why he's not the one doing the killing. It's not a question you should expect to see addressed here.\nI wouldn't dream of giving away the ending, because it's so unpredictable, but it involves an extended shootout at a not-very-secure compound, and some deaths occur. Will Cataleya get the closure she apparently so desperately needs? You may as well ask if the sun will rise in the east and set in the west."}

That's the crux of the effectiveness of The Chernobyl Diaries, a look at a group of tourists in and around the site of the titular 1986 nuclear accident. Although the characters are superficial, there's enough familiarity there to elicit sympathy, and none of their actions seem contrived or manipulative. Their terror feels genuine, and that's what you really want in a thematic horror movie like this.\nAmericans Chris, Natalie, and Amanda are traveling the world. Chris plans to propose to Natalie in Moscow, but first the trio heads to Kiev, where they rendezvous with Chris' brother Paul, who's been away from the family for a long time. Paul talks the group into trying some \"extreme tourism\" - in this case, a trip to the abandoned city of Prypiat, in the shadow of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. Joining them is a backpacking couple, Michael and Zoe. Their tour guide is a former Soviet Special Forces soldier named Uris.\nThe trip gets off to an inauspicious start when the group is denied access by guards at Prypiat's gate. (You may wonder why an abandoned city needs guards. So did one of the characters.) But Uris knows a shortcut, and before long they're all in Prypiat, happily snapping pictures. But are they alone? It would be a sad movie if they were. After a strange encounter with some actual wildlife, the group finds that their van won't start, thus precipitating a desperate situation that very quickly spirals out of control. Bad things happen.\nWe expect bad things to happen. Director Bradley Parker (with a script from Paranormal Activity's Oren Peli), though, keeps things moving at a breakneck pace, focusing on what we can't see rather than forcing some sort of overstated conflict among the tourists. I do thing this is a huge plus. Some movies go to ridiculous lengths to have their characters bickering about some perceived slight, only to band together. The people in The Chernobyl Diaries, though, snipe at each other out of what feels like sincere terror and frustration. Resentment does rear its ugly head, but it's understandable.\nAs you might have guessed, they're not alone in Prypriat. What's out there is a great unknown; in fact, it's not really until the final scene that we get a clear idea of what our protagonists had to deal with. But the conflict in the story is omnipresent: there's conflict among the tourists, to a slight degree; there's conflict between them and whatever lurks in the shadows (remember, our pals not even supposed to be there - although it's purportedly safe to be in the old city for a short period of time); there's conflict between them and radiation. \nUltimately, it doesn't matter that the characters aren't, shall we say, fleshed out. Why would they need to be? You don't need a lot of intelligent dialog - you just need dialog that makes sense given the panic-inducing situation, and that's what you get here. From start to finish, the movie never lets the horror subside, even for a moment. The characters can't relax, and so neither can you.\nIf I had to change anything about the movie, it might be the ending. No spoilers here, of course. The ending isn't terrible and is appropriate horrifying, but I half expected a twist of some sort. But that's really splitting hairs. By and large, the movie is as scary as I expected it to be and uses the backdrop of the Chernobyl accident to great effect. It's a little formulaic, but it still seems to work within the confines of its idiom."}

It's a keeper.\nThis time around, the taciturn K (Jones) finds himself the target of the nefarious Boris the Animal (Jermaine Clement), a bad, bad alien who's just broken out of the maximum-security prison designed to hold him on the Moon. Turns out Boris isn't just out to get K, though; he plans to travel back in time to when K arrested him (and shot his arm off) and kill him there. This, of course, leads to a time-travel journey taken by Agent J (Smith), who must stop Boris before he messes up the future for K - and instigates a full-scale alien invasion in the present day. \nIt's the kind of movie that doesn't need to try too hard to win an audience over. We know the characters; put them in an interesting situation, and everything works out fine. Some movies throw in the figurative kitchen sink, the better to confuse the audience into thinking everything means something - when, in fact, nothing means a darn thing. MIB doesn't bother with trickery. The personalities of J and K - well established and reflective of the public perception of Messrs. Smith and Jones - meld so seamlessly and are so symbiotic that the actual plot is almost (almost) relegated to the background.\nRemember, it can be difficult to create a decent third film in a series. There are no surprises with the characters, and presumably we know all about someone's backstory. In MIB III, though, we do learn a little bit about Agent K's past. But thanks to a vibrant script by Joel Coen, that past history is more complementary than front and center. I think a focus on just K's 1969 life would have made for a pretty dull movie. I mean, it's not as if he's Mr. Excitement, right?\nClement is a terrific, terrible villain as the monstrous Boris the Animal (\"It's just BORIS!\"); he has this nifty parasite thing that lives in his remaining hand, and when he aims the hand at someone, a dart shoots out. Pretty cool. Emma Thompson is also on board as the new head of the MIBs (her name? O, of course. Get it? O and K?); former leader Zed (Rip Torn) has passed away. Alice Eve plays the 1969 version of O as well. \nAn undercomplicated plot doesn't mean that the special effects are blasted in your face, though. In fact, they're kept at a minimum, again lending support to the charisma of Jones and Smith instead of supplanting it. There are some cool transportation devices in 1969 (but not in the current day, weird), and the time-travel device itself is wacky (it's a time JUMP, literally). The effects feel as if they're meant to be there, not that they're shoehorned in to make things look pretty. And that's a positive development.\nMen in Black III is a typical, solid blockbuster action movie. Not all action movies can stand up to much scrutiny, and if you're Michael Bay they don't stand up to any scrutiny at all, not when your third act is always Blow Stuff Up. This is an audience pleaser with a fascinating plot, amiable performances, good effects and set pieces, and some funny dialog to boot."}

Straw Dogs has no bite.\nYou might remember the '71 film. Sam Peckinpah set it in rural England. The main character was a mathematician/pacifist, played by Dustin Hoffman. Soon, he and the missus are terrorized by local hoods. This one, directed by Rod Lurie (The Contender, The Last Castle), stars James Marsden as an LA screenwriter who moves with his wife Amy (Kate Bosworth) to her daddy's old homestead. No mention is made of writer David's pacifism, but we're led to assume he's not the fighting kind, in obvious and stark contrast to the good ol' boys who live in the town. Soon, yep, the local boys are terrorizing both Amy and David.\nAdded to the fish-out-of-water theme is the backdrop of the religion of high-school football. Lot of pressure on the kids, even more on the coach. James Woods appears as a drunken lout of an ex-coach, a foul- mouthed buffoon who's essentially a caricature of redneck ignorance and entitlement. I don't expect much nuance out of Woods anyway, but he's so over the top here that I wonder if he just did the best he could with the material he had. Anyway, Woods' character Coach Heddon has a nubile cheerleader daughter (of course) who, in a subplot that is more meaningful than it ought to be, is ambiguously attracted to the town's one mentally handicapped man (there may be others, but this one is at least diagnosed; Coach naturally doesn't care for this and flies off the handle pretty frequently if he sniffs something's amiss. \nAmy and David hire Amy's ex, Charlie (Alex Skargaard) and his friends to patch the roof of their barn. Big mistake, but understandable, since David wants to make nice with the town (he drives a Jag, wears nice clothes, looks the part of the Better Than You crowd). But soon enough, the couple are menaced by Charlie and company, sometimes with subtlety, sometimes not.\nPeckinpah's original film was about the breaking point of a peaceful man. Lurie's didn't seem to be making that point. That is, the violence in the '71 film existed to substantiate a theme; here, it's there just to shock and anger. But it fails to do the former - everything is easily predictable - and since we never really get into the heads of the two leads, it cannot hope to achieve the latter, either.\nThe acting is pretty atrocious. Neither Marsden nor Bosworth comes off particularly well, but my expectations for either are pretty low, and they met them. It's another contrast with the '71 movie. Dustin Hoffman was entering his peak and offered a terrific, terrifying performance. Susan George wasn't bad, either. But Marsden and Bosworth seemed to have been cast simply because they look good as a couple.I believed they were married, but nothing they said or did invested me in their problems to any real degree.\nWhereas Hoffman's character was a brainy math wizard, Marsden's is... a screenwriter. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying screen writing is easy, although this film does make a good case for that argument. But let's face it; the movie would have worked better if David had been a novelist, or a professor, or a researcher. In any event, despite his work-area props (including blackboard), David never seems to be particularly bright. Such as the time when he lets Charlie talk him into going hunting with the boys, despite the fact that he's never fired a weapon. Oy.\nThe scary scenes aren't scary, the climax is expected but still jarring, there is no nuance to be found in any character, and the movie feels a lot longer than it really is, because there are many scenes that exist merely to pad the running time, rather than to advance something as mundane as a plot. The theme of a peaceful man finally breaking is merely hinted at here; Hoffman's slow change in the original is replaced by a blink-and-you-miss-it transformation by Marsden that, on the whole, is as senseless as the violence it provokes."}

Even as sword-and-sandal type movies go, this remake of the Schwarzeneggar cult fave has many of the requisite ingredients for a cheeseball movie, but there's a lack of charm and, yes, cheese. You might be better off skipping the tepid do-over entirely.\nConan (Jason Momoa) is war-born, meaning his mother died right on the battlefield while giving birth to him. His dad is the barbarian's chieftain, Corin (Ron Perlman), who - no spoiler, really - is quickly dispatched of by an evildoer who's intent on resurrecting his dead sorceress wife by means of a magical mask and the blood of a virgin. (When watching this movie, if you dare, you may wonder why the various tribes didn't just destroy the mask instead of cutting into identical shards to be buried individually. Me too.) \nConan may have the smarts of The Hulk, but he does have some sort of honor code. Hard to imagine that a barbarian would have a moral code, but there you go. When people save his life, he helps them, rather than just slaying them. Maybe he's just smarter than the average barbarian. At any rate, a virgin named Tamara (Rachel Nichols) gets on his good side, and luckily they both have Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang) as an enemy. Zym, a master swordsman himself, has the assistance of his weird-looking daughter Marique (Rose McGowan), who's following in her mom's evil footsteps by being a despicable, magic-wielding wench with a barbed tongue. This makes her infinitely more interesting than either Conan or Tamara.\nThere is much blood shed. There are plenty of battles. Don't look for nuance. It's not meant to make an appearance, although every now and then Conan appears to have a hidden layer. But not really. He has a single minded quest, although he doesn't mind helping others along the way. Aren't barbarians supposed to be, you know, barbaric?\nUnlike the Arnold version, there's no great speech about hearing the lamentations of the women of one's enemies, who are then driven before you. This Conan, speaking as briefly as possible, probably doesn't know what a lamentation is. He's quick with a sword, not with his wit.\nThe movie isn't terribly good, even if it's your thing. It's dark for many action scenes, thus making it difficult to see who's getting beat up by Conan. Even when it's light out, there's not a lot of imagination in the battle, except when Marique's involved. But when she's not around, which is often, it's really just a simple sword fight by a muscleman and some one else.\nAnd poor Morgan Freeman - how did he get roped into narrating this? Did he owe a debt? He lends the movie a lot more gravitas than it deserves, although it's definitely needed. With any luck, he completed his work in a day or so.\nThe rest of the cast is uneven. Lang is his usual constipated self; typecasting, perhaps. Ron Perlman is great in his few scenes as Conan's dad. Nichols is eye candy. Said Taghmaoui provides good comic relief for a spell, and Nonso Anozie is a big, charismatic actor who probably could have been Conan. \nOdd fact: in this movie, the title character's name is pronounced just like Conan O'Brien's - that is, like \"Ko-nin\"; in the original, it was pronounced \"Ko-nan.\" Why this is, I don't know. Did the filmmakers think people would relate better to the former pronunciation? Give me Conan the Librarian instead."}

They did it right.", "content": "Guess I'll come out and say it right away: The Avengers may be the best superhero movie made to date. It has plenty of action, an understandable plot, multiple and discernible heroes, plenty of laughs, and terrific effects. Now, I'll admit it: everyone else seems to be saying the same thing. So do I need to maintain my integrity as an amateur reviewer- person by going against the grain and finding fault with the movie? Or can I feel secure in my own opinion, even if it's shared by fanboys and nonfans alike? (Hint: it's the latter.) Who are The Avengers, anyway? Well, there's Captain America (Steve Rogers), who's actually from the 1940s but was frozen for about seventy years. There's Iron Man (Tony Stark), a man in a weaponized metal suit. There's The Hulk (Bruce Banner), who smashes. There's Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff), a superspy with some powers of her own. There's Hawkeye (Clint Barton), a master archer. And then there's Thor, a Norse god. We've been introduced to most of them already through their own films, so they seem like old pals to us. Helps cut down on backstory issues, anyway.\nIt seems that Loki, the half-brother of Thor, has decided to open up a portal from his side of the universe to Earth itself, thus allowing a rampaging army of aliens to come in and slaughter us wholesale. Colonel Nick Fury, who's been recruiting our heroes to fight as a team, calls everyone in from wherever they were. They don't know each other, except by reputation. Can they stop bickering long enough to save the universe? It is possible.\nI mentioned before that our heroes are, well, discernible. This is no small feat, considering how many there are in the movie. Tony Stark is a narcissist. Steve Rogers is an anachronism. Bruce Banner has anger- management issues. Natasha is manipulative; Barton is manipulated. They're simultaneously human and superhuman.\nAfter assembling his team, Fury gives them the skinny. Banner's job is to find the Tesserac's location, an artifact that can produce immense power \u2013 or be wielded as an immense weapon. Supposedly, the Tesserac is high in gamma radiation, something Dr. Banner knows a little bit about. Meanwhile, the others are tasked with finding Loki, who's quite the badass. All of this is directed by Fury from a flying fortress that also can float. Kind of neat.\nWithout the burden of needing backstories for everyone, writer/director Joss Whedon is free to throw thrills at us. The fight scenes are plausible and, at times, not at all cartoonish. This means that younger kids (it's a PG-13 movie) might find it a little intense. But there's very little blood, and what's seen is more like scratches on a face, or something. At any rate, although it's an unapologetically violent movie, it's carefully done; the amazing set pieces don't get in the way of a compelling story fraught with plenty of angst and anguish. This is how Transformers should have been.\nBoy, is there conflict. It's not as if the superheroes all show up mentally on board with Fury's plan. Not only are some of them mad at him, they snipe a little at each other. Sometimes this is the work of the masterful Loki; sometimes it's the natural difficult of strangers needing to form a cohesive unit.\nThe acting is superb. Nick Fury is a role for which the estimable Samuel L. Jackson was born to play (and which he's played as a cameo in several movies already). Scarlett Johanssen picks up where she left off as Black Widow in Iron Man, and Robert Downey Jr., to no one's surprise, is effortlessly suave and jerkish as Stark. Chris Evans, as the idealistic Captain, and Chris Hemsworth, as the mighty but humbled Thor, are both terrific as well. Mark Ruffalo makes for a quietly intense Banner (and portrayed The Hulk via special effects). Jeremy Renner, seen very briefly in the Thor movie, is Hawkeye, a character with which most of us had had no prior exposure; Renner, however, gives his character so much depth that we're involved in his side story even more than we are with the others.\nSo why wouldn't you watch this movie? It does have a lot of action, so if you hate that you should skip it. It's over two hours long, so if you don't like to sit, you should also skip it. It has strong female characters, hissable villains, heroes of all sizes, complicated love stories that sit in the background, and the fate of all mankind resting in the balance. Wait, I was supposed to be giving reasons not to watch it. Too bad, I've run out."}

It zips through the titular hero's origin story, shoehorns a faux villain into the plot, and ends on a promise of a sequel. I'll say this much for it - it is certainly green.\nHal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) is a hot-shot jet pilot who'd be more at home in a movie like Top Gun. He's cocky but caring, aloof and irresponsible. The latter trait plays a big role in the development of his character in this movie. He comes across a dying alien who bequeaths a magic ring to him; like any of us, Hal takes the ring. The ring is green and is as powerful as the imagination of its wearer. This leads to some inventive problem solving when the first of two evil-doers shows up. The CGI is mostly believable, as long as you understand that this is a comic-book movie and that laws of physics need not apply universally.\nThe crux of it all is that Hal Jordan is now part of the Green Lantern Corps, a legion of guardians who protect the universe from evil, which, by some strange coincidence has congealed together to create a bad guy made of fear. The idea is that the villain Parallax uses fear to suck out the souls of its enemies, or something, and so the Lanterns must have no fear. \nCan Hal Jordan overcome his deeply hidden fears of failure to save the world? Will he be able to reconcile with his beautiful, supersmart coworker Carol (Blake Lively)? Will he rally the remaining Green Lanterns to fight back and not to use fear against Parallax? Boy, if only I could easily predict the answers to those questions. If only this movie were that obvious. Okay, maybe it is that obvious. But in a way, that's all right. You don't really expect intricate plots in a comic- book movie.\nEven though I could suspend my disbelief easily enough, I did have some issues with the movie. It felt like there was a lot of focus on the hero and his Big Transformation from selfish flyboy to savior and not enough on some of the peripheral stuff, such as his relationship with Carol, Carol's relationship with her inventor/bigwig father, and how their mutual childhood friend Hector (Peter Sarsgaard) fits into all of this - and his own relationship with his father. I'm just saying there were a lot of secondary and tertiary characters that were given short shrift, and yet in the grand scheme of the plot they mattered quite a bit. \nA second issue is much more mundane - the plot is pretty mundane, standard-issue stuff. Hero becomes Superhero, wrestles with some inner demons while trying to look cool, fights human and alien bad guys with, as usual, the fate of the universe at stake. As little of the comics as I knew, I was actually expecting a different bad guy; he's in this movie, but he's not The Bad Guy. I believe that's what they call Hoping the Movie Is a Huge Success So We Can Do a Sequel with the New Bad Guy. And although the movie didn't make its money back in the States, its worldwide grosses may have ensured that sequel anyway. The Green Lantern character is interesting, as well as whole idea behind the Corps (Jordan is the first human). Maybe a sequel would elaborate more on that area.\nAs for the acting, Reynolds was a pretty good casting. He had the look, the patter, the swagger. Lively was also surprisingly competent. Tim Robbins offers up a pained - but thankless - performance as a senator, and Jay O. Sanders is smarmy as usual as An Important Guy. Probably the standout is Peter Sarsgaard, who plays the childhood pal of both Carol and Hal and whose attitude plays a heavy role in the story.\nGreen Lantern works sometimes but suffers from an underdeveloped script, too much backstory, not enough front story, and questionable direction. It feels at times as if you're watching not a movie about a comic book but a movie about a movie about a comic book. Not enough attention is paid to the subtleties of the plot or the nuances of the lead roles."}

I hate these guys.", "content": "I admit that I don't know what to make of this, that there's been a run of comic-book movies that have managed to be plausible and thrilling, not cheap knockoffs rushed out to exploit a fad. Captain America: The First Avenger is one of the former. It features a terrific performance by Chis Evans as the Cap, a modicum of special effects and CGI, a slimy villain played by Hugo Weaving, and the famous backdrop of World War II. So help me, I found myself liking the movie despite my preconceptions.\nSteve Rogers (Evans) is a spindly, sickly young man who's full of desire to go fight those dastardly Nazis, but he's just too frail for the military, so he's classified 4F. Several times, in fact, under different names. A mysterious scientist named Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) recruits Rogers to be part of a secret project: he'll inject Rogers' major organs and arteries with a new serum that will turn him into a super soldier. The military, represented by Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones), and the CIA, represented by Agent Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) are very interested in the results. Well, the results aren't too good, as the Nazis grab the serum and prevent anyone from making more super soldiers. But at least the US has Rogers, right? He's now super strong, fast, and agile.\nBut one man is not an army, so instead of leading troops to victory Rogers is instead hired as a sort of USO cheerleader for war bonds. Yep, seriously. But you can't keep the good Captain down for long, and soon he is indeed leading some crazy mission to rescue his best friend Bucky and assorted Allied troops while also looking out for the nefarious Red Skull, head of Hitler's science division.\nIt's well cast. Evans is believable as both the skinny Rogers and the pumped-up Captain America. He's earnest without seeming to take himself or the movie too seriously. Tucci, Jones, Weaving and newcomer Atwell are top notch as well.\nEven bearing in mind that this movie is merely a setup for the big Avengers film coming out soon (as were other movies, like Iron Man, Thor, and The Hulk), one can easily lose oneself in the great old-time action-adventure feel this one has, reminiscent of 1991's The Rocketeer. You have mad scientists, mythical technology, Nazis, all-American good guys, lots of neat guns. It's not a loud bore like Transformers, and the action scenes are well staged, as are the pyrotechnics. Throw in a believable plot (at least in the realm of comic-book movies), and this one's above average for the genre. I've probably said this before about other movies, but this is definitely one that's what a comic-book movie should be - daring, easy to follow, full of pulse-pounding action, and human."}

Sign me up", "content": "We've all had them, although not quite the way these guys do. Mean boss- bullies. What looked at first to be another dopey Office Space wannabe turned out to be pretty hysterical in places. Part of it's the script, but a lot of it is in the casting. Think of it as more than Office Space - it's Office Space with the piquant aftertaste of The Hangover.\nNick (Jason Bateman) has one of those tyrannical hate-everyone bosses (Kevin Spacey). Kurt's (Jason Sudeikis) boss is a coked-up freak (Colin Farrell). Dale (Charlie Day) has an oversexed maneater (Jennifer Aniston, playing way against type). Each for his own reason has issues. And, for reasons not necessary to reveal here, they conclude that each supervisor must be killed off.\nI liked this movie. For one thing, I could - as I'm sure many people can - identify easily with each of the main characters to some extent. They were relatable, not caricatures. I mean, sure, they sort of leap to the conclusion rather quickly that murder should be committed, but that's just nitpicking. You buy into the premise, you take what you get.\nIt's a well-cast film. Bateman surprised me a great deal. When I heard he was to be in this movie, I assumed he'd be one of the bosses, because he's lately played so many smarmy jerks. But not here - here, he's the sensible one, and he gets some of the best lines in the movie. Delivery is flawless. Sudeikis I could do without, but he does add some smarm of his own, thus offsetting Nick's niceness rather neatly. But for me the best was Charlie Day, who's best known for his role on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. He's a manic panic and a true comic find. I hope this turns out to be a bit of a breakout role for him.\nThe bosses are also interestingly cast. I mean, I always pictured Aniston as a goody two-shoes. That's the image, right? The good girl who meets cute with someone? Oh, not here. So not here. Here she's about as X rated as you can get. And she's stunningly good at it, too. Doesn't even feel like she's playing a role. Spacey is essentially playing the same role he had in Swimming with Sharks, only even nastier, and of course he's up to the task. Farrell gets the short end of the stick; he gets limited screen time, but that's okay.\nHorrible Bosses offers plenty of madcap fun at an R-rated level without stooping to poop jokes. A nice switch, wouldn't you say? I mean, it's not Henry V, but at least it's not Freddy Got Fingered. It's at the right intelligence level - you can veg out and enjoy it without feeling the least bit ashamed."}

It's another origin film designed to show us how the original X-Men came to be and how their founder, Charles Xavier, teamed up with Erik Lehnsherr to thwart a thermonuclear war in 1962. Along the way, we learn about the Erik's inner demons and thirst for revenge and Charles' implacable sensibility. \nI was interested in seeing this movie not just because I wanted to know how it all began but because I was already emotionally invested in the series, having seen four X-Men movies just in the past decade or so. That's how Hollywood is getting you nowadays, you know. Make a big movie, then make a sequel, then a prequel, then a spin-off, all designed to keep you coming back, because you know each character and recognize a bit of yourself in them as well. Here, you have the dark side (Magneto) and the light side (Professor X) - much like Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Star Wars films, right? A classic setup.\nWe learn that Erik, later to become Magneto, is a concentration-camp survivor who saw his mother shot to death when he could not perform his extrasensory powers to the camp commandant under duress. Now he is out to find that commander, some twenty years later. Alternatively, Charles is a ladies' man who's also exceedingly bright, working on a theses about genetics. He's a telepath and wishes to learn more about genetic mutations. His childhood friend Raven has her own mysterious powers - in her true form she is entirely blue with red hair, a striking if possibly unwelcoming figure. \nThe unifying agent that brings Erik (Michael Fassnbender) and Charles (James McAvoy) together is one Sebastian Shaw, played by an oily Kevin Bacon. Shaw's plan is to get the US and the USSR to declare war on one another, thus wiping each other out, thus (apparently) leaving only mutants, who shall inherit the Earth. Erik wants to kill Shaw; Charles simply wants to stop him. They're consistently at odds with each other as they recruit other mutants to their cause in 1962, even as Charles helps Erik break down his own barriers to harness his powers.\nThis gets the CIA involved (Rose Byrne), and then there's a well-done standoff at the US-USSR blockade showdown (you know, the Bay of Pigs) that tests the wills of everyone involved. I liked that; good action.\nA recurring theme in the X-Men movies is the battle between being who you are (i.e., a mutant) and being accepted by society (i.e., a mutant who looks like everyone else). It's not hard to draw a comparison between being a mutant and being \"different.\" Do you want to just fit in, or do you want to be your own person? Raven, aka Mystique (played to perfection by Jennifer Lawrence) isn't sure, either. Neither are some of the other mutants, leading to a schism that would later show up in each of the other films.\nFirst Class isn't really anything special, but it's pleasing to the eye (both in effects and in cast choice) and keeps true to its familiar characters. It fits in fairly seamlessly with the other films. It's easy to follow, of course, and the cast does a very fine job. McAvoy seems to be getting better with each role (good thing, because he was one terrible actor when he started); Fassbender, Lawrence, even January Jones (as Emma Frost) are fine as well."}

Sure, you have to suspend a little bit of logic, and the great old tradition of a dystopian future is revived, but overall it's an excellent film with terrific camera-work and editing and a knockout performance by the soon-to-be-a-huge-star Jennifer Lawrence.\nSo there was this big war, and the world was divided into 12 districts, and as a reminder of its vicious past the Capitol decreed that each district send two children, ages 12-18, to participate in a fight to the death. Somehow this is to remind them of not only their past but humility and the fact that they're likely to die young. But it seems like a post-apocalyptic society with a blend of technology and rustic charm, so who knows. Anyway, 24 kids, chosen randomly at ceremonies called Reapings, and it's all a Big Deal. They've been doing it for almost three-quarters of a century.\nDistrict 12 is a hardscrabble, coal-mining community whose mine blew up. So people are pretty destitute. They (barely) live off the land. When the Reaping comes, Primrose Everdeen and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) are chosen. Poor Prim's just a little girl, so her older sister Katniss (Lawrence) volunteers in her place. This has apparently never happened before, which seems implausible, but you can go with it.\nThe two Tributes are then taken to the capitol city, where they are judged and evaluated in order to gain sponsors; sponsors can help you when you're in the middle of the forest. Preparing Katniss and Peeta for the Games is Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), who's actually won the games and can offer advice, and Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) whose job it is to make the two Tributes look good when being presented in the parade and the talk show and so on and so on. And then the games begin.\nImagine you're in the middle of a field within a semicircle containing 23 other young people. Some of them are athletic. Some are tiny and may never have left the house. Some have been preparing their entire lives. There is a cache of weaponry and food near the semicircle. Your mission is to survive longer than everyone else. You're under a lot of stress already, and now it really sinks in - you will certainly have to kill one or more of those you see, kids with whom you have no quarrel. Kill or be killed, as they say.\nThe entire Games takes place in a huge climate-controlled dome. In fact, everything can be created/controlled, including fire and animals. As in the TV series Survivor, some of the kids form alliances, led by alpha males. Katniss isn't that kind of creature. She doesn't even want to be there. Who does? The ones who have been training all their lives, of course. \nThe cinematography is riveting. It's sometimes tough to get a read on a situation when all you see are people running through the woods, close up. Not here. The director of photography, Tom Stern, does a miraculous job of keeping us in the story, involved with the main characters, without losing the edge of heart-racing action. \nI thought Lawrence was amazing in her gritty performance in Winter's Bone. This cements, in my mind, her standing as a tremendous talent. She is perfect for this role; her Katniss is tenacious, willful, and both terrified and determined. She's a skilled archer (has to be back home in order to find any food) but lacks a certain, shall we say, charm. Although she's not unattractive, she never smiles, seems resentful, and as a result is tough to get along with. Before the games, anyway. Through the tutelage of Cinna and Abernathy, she's able to show enough grace and poise to win some people over.\nIt's a knockout performance. Sure, you're supposed to be rooting for her anyway, even though she isn't the underdog in the fight. She's the one with the compelling backstory - young sister and distant mother at home, father killed in mine accident. She has a lot to fight for. Lawrence can evoke respect and fear just by her expressive eyes. And, of course, the role itself is physically very demanding, and she's well up to the task. But Lawrence's great skill here is in engaging the audience to the point where even if they believe she will win, they desperately want to know how she'll accomplish it. Will she kill? Will she not kill someone? (Remember, only one can survive.)\nI like it when movies that seem to have a certain predictability about them - a predetermined finale, for example - throw in a twist that makes perfect sense but still isn't really foreseeable. As long as a seismic character change doesn't occur (such as a \"good\" person very suddenly becoming \"bad\" to further the plot), this is a welcome change - and it's tough to do. Big praise to The Hunger Games for throwing in twists that weren't laughable and to leaving the ending a little open ended in some regards. Not all loose ends are tied up. They often aren't in real life, either.\nSo, as long as you don't closely question the movie's overall premise, you'll be very pleased with this film. It's well acted all around, immaculately shot and edited, and has intense, action scenes that will leave you as exhausted as the participants."}

Or twos. For that matter, the first one could be pretty rancid, too. But the intended audience for the Transformers movies don't care; no matter how wretched and incomprehensible these movies are, they make money. Probably partly because they're now being released in 3D, tickets to which are more costly, but I digress.\nSome people like to watch things blow up and require little else in a movie. We refer to these people as Michael Bay fans. Bay here continues his long-standing tradition of churning out a pile of exploding crap - but with robots! They make all the difference. Imagine a movie in which every scene was essentially a \"we're running out of time\" scenario, with every other minute filled with something either getting hit or hitting something else, and you have a Michael Bay movie. This is not news.\nI can't blame Bay for making the movie or for actors like Shia Labeouf and John Turturro and Josh Duhamel appearing in them. The movies are mints, both domestically and internationally. Explosions are the true worldly language. And I can't blame those who want only this kind of movie to exist; after all, in theory their patronage allows smaller films to exist. But all of that aside, this is a trainwreck of a movie. It has a laughable plot, hysterically bad acting, and unfathomable fight scenes and seems to have been filmed by a pixie in the middle of a glue-sniffing marathon. It's inept and probably shouldn't be watched unless one is actually under the influence. Or paid.\nAnyway, it seems something's been dormant on the moon lo these many years - hence why no one's conveniently been back since '72 - and it has something to do with our new friends, the Autobots. Megatron, evil bad guy supreme, is back; Optimus Prime, super good guy revives an older prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy) inside the ship found on the moon, but before you know it the Autobots are fighting Megatron's Decepticons in an effort not to take over the world. Some robots return from the first and/or second movies. Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky (Labeouf), the luckless loser of the first two films who somehow manages to get the girl and his own pet robot/car, is also back - with a new girl, played by the very British newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, and is now looking for a job. He's constantly whining about it, too. Oh, and his new girl - whom he met while getting a medal from President Obama, no less - has a kick-ass job doing something or other with a suspicious-looking Patrick Dempsey.\nIn short - robots attack, other robots fight back, good robot-on-robot action, boy saves world again, gets girl, and roll credits.\nWhat's there to like about this one? Well, Huntington-Whiteley is not terrible. She may even be better than the deposed Megan Fox. But she doesn't screw up, and that's good. She looks pretty, and the camera notices. Hm, other than that, there's some interesting fight scenes. But let me tell you about those fight scenes.\nWhen you have two robots fighting each other, particularly amid an urban landscape, you should make sure they are discernible from each other. I know, sounds elementary and obvious, but not to Michael Bay. There are plenty of fight scenes in which each or all robot participants are gray/beige. Optimus Prime is easy to pick out - he's blue and red. Bumblebee is yellow. Most, if not all, of the Decepticons are gray and black. Even some of the Autobots are gray and black. Then the action is so whiplash inducing that it's tough to understand who's actually winning a battle.\nThis kind of movie requires that one suspend disbelief. This movie in particular, however, requires that you expel disbelief from your mind for an extended, indefinite leave. First, there's the robots. They're sentient and have weaponry. And yet somehow they're not bulletproof. Now, I'm not bulletproof, although I can strap on a vest that will make me so, to a degree, but the reason we humans don't wear them is that a) we're not always in peril and b) the vests are pretty heavy and not at all slimming. Why aren't these robots impervious to Earth bullets? Then there's Sam Witless. Fresh out of college, he expects - because he saved the world twice! - to land a Top Job. He's an idiot. There's literally no reason for him to be hanging around at all in this movie, because he shouldn't possess the skills to fight alongside the Autobots. He's small, he's dumb, he's weak - or so he seems. Yeah, in the fight scenes he's suddenly Superman. He runs like a stuntman. (For that matter, so does Huntington-Whiteley.) How did he come to have such power and strength? How come he's given - more than once - firearms? Has he training in operating these weapons? I am thinking no. He's like a little kid who thinks he's Indiana Jones and John McClane rolled into one. Just awful.\nTo top it all off, we also get the return of Sam's parents, who apparently are RVing around the world and visit Sam a week earlier than he'd thought - oh, sitcom time! As before, his mom's incredibly dumb but well meaning and his dad's a sullen jerk who obviously turns good at the end. (For half the movie he brings up how his son doesn't have a job yet.) I hope none of you saw this in the theater. If you did, I hope you didn't pay extra to see it in 3D. Why bother? This movie's an embarrassment. Amazingly, Frances McDormand is in this movie. She has a rather large role. She should burn all copies of this movie and pretend it never happened. She should return to, you know, good movies. I felt so bad for her here."}

It's in two parts, and it essentially has two plots that are tangentially related. Viewed as a whole, it feels incomplete; when each part is viewed separately, one part seems much more relatable and tangible than the other. It is at times esoteric and full of deep meaning, and it features some interesting performances by Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg. Since it is directed by Lars von Trier, it will as a matter of course not be for all tastes. \nThe first chapter is named after Dunst's character, Justine. The scene is a wedding and reception at a secluded mansion. Justine is getting married to Michael, and the mansion is owned by Justine's sister and brother in law. It is a lavish affair, but Justine becomes more and more morose as the evening progresses. We're not sure exactly why, and it's not evident she knows, either, but in any event she is quickly a psychological wreck, sometimes disappearing before major events as the cake cutting and dinner eating. It's obvious Justine feels she's making a mistake, but she's unable to articulate why. Only her sister Claire (Gainsbourg) attempts to help her, as nearly everyone else seems much more absorbed in themselves than in the happiness of the bride.\nNear the end of the chapter - not a spoiler - Justine notices that a star that her brother in law John (Kiefer Sutherland) had pointed out before, Antarer, is missing from its constellation. An oddity, to be sure. That leads us to the second chapter, which is devoted to Claire and takes place some time after the reception. The reason for the quick disappearance of Antares (a red giant some 1000 light years from Earth) is noted - a heretofore unknown planet, hiding behind the Sun, had briefly eclipsed Antares. Oh, and it's heading toward Earth. But don't be afraid, says John, who's an amateur astronomer; it'll pass by us harmlessly. \nThe chapter is told from Claire's point of view regarding her apprehension of this planet fly-by and her relationship with Justine. In truth, we get a lot more of the astronomical aspect of the rogue planet (named Melancholia) and its approach to Earth. John and Claire's young son Leo (Cameron Spurr) even constructs a device made of wire that allows the user to determine how quickly Melancholia is moving. \nThe first chapter is about an hour long. In my mind, it could have all been cut. My impression is that it was intended to lay the foundation for the relationship between Justine and Claire, but truthfully it seemed superficial and boring. I knew less about either than I should have, and as the chapter progressed I became a little annoyed at Claire's seemingly selfish behavior. I guess we were supposed to feel sympathy for her - and I did, a little - but without some clarification of why she felt so horribly bummed out, it was tough to be on her side, particularly when she seemed to have misgivings about the wedding right from the first scene. (This may have been explained in a scene late in the movie, but if that was the explanation, it was a lame one.)\nImages and imagery are both at full throttle here, but this isn't Kubrick's 2001. The opening scene, showing the slow-motion destruction of planets colliding is interesting to look at but drags on for more than seven minutes. It's arty and portentous, but it's tough to get through. After that we have myriad interactions with unpleasant characters - except for Justine and Leo, and that's about it. By then I was so tired of Justine's mumblings and attitude - even as I sympathized with her, as she tried to get someone, anyone, to talk to her - that I was looking forward to the second chapter. \nClaire's chapter, in which she really takes a back seat to the new planet, is the more intriguing of the two. What will happen when Melancholia passes Earth? Scientists say nothing will happen; John concurs. So why is Justine, now a complete depressive, even more withdrawn and reticent, so passive while others fret about Life? She claims to know things (with some pretty floppy evidence to support it), too. I guess that makes her Claire-voyant. I could have resisted that, but I blame von Trier on making his character Know Things.\nThe final scene does have some deep meaning, and it's very well done. In fact, even as it unfolds I had no idea how it was going to end; von Trier could have gone in a couple of directions with equal plausibility. Those ending shots are wondrous to behold and go a long way to making the film."}

But at least it's based on a graphic novel (which can be seen in the prologue) and carries with it a plausible, intriguing backstory. Priest delivers more than it promises, reinvigorating a clich\u00e9d premise thanks to CGI wizardry and courageous characters, and pulse-quickening action scenes.\nHere's your backstory. A long time ago, vampires attacked mankind. But mankind found a super weapon, namely priests endowed with special vamp- fighting skills. Mankind succeeded in defeating the vampires, relegating the survivors (and their familiars) to sealed-in prisons and such. The super-powered priests then were assimilated into society. But society, it turned out, would need them again. Fast forward years later, with many of the priests dead and gone and people living in walled-in cities ruled by religion, one that takes itself seriously and claims that the vampires are no longer a threat. Wouldn't be much of a movie if it were true.\nWhen a certain Priest's niece is kidnapped (and her dad badly injured, and her mom killed) by vampires, said Priest (Paul Bettany) breaks his vows and goes after her, to the chagrin of the Church. He's joined by his niece's boyfriend (Cam Gigandet), who's also a sheriff, across the badlands of what looks like the Mojave Desert. They must venture into the prisons and hives of the vampires. And if you know anything about vampires, you know that they prefer the dark, meaning that most of this film is rather tough to see.\nLuckily, the fight scenes are either lit by flashlights or take place in broad daylight between beings that are not vampires, which is helpful. There's also a train involved. I'm trying not to give away key elements of the plot here, but there are so elements anyway that it's a daunting task. \nNaturally, our Priest isn't going to be allowed to just leave the walled city. No, the Monsignor (Christopher Plummer) has sent out four other Priests to bring him back. Probably alive, but who am I to judge? At any rate, one of them is the lovely Maggie Q, although technically she's a Priestess. She instead teams with the two men to find this elusive niece.\nHere's a quick list of what I liked about the movie. Paul Bettany. Maggie Q. Karl Urban as the bad guy. The scene on the train. Those bad- ass motorcycles racing across the desert. The martial arts. But I'm glad I didn't see it in the theater. It's good, but it's not big-screen good. It's certainly not 3D good. It's better than your typical man-on-a- mission fluff, but mostly it's because of the relentless intensity that Bettany brings to his role. Reminded me of his part in The Da Vinci Code, although in that movie he was really the bad guy. I'm digressing.\nLet's put it this way. Priest is better than Legion, which was about angels sent from heaven to destroy us all, and only One Man could save us. Not quite vampires, but same general idea. It's also better than Judge Dredd, which of course was set in a city that was controlled autonomously by \"judges\" not unlike the religious leaders here. So it's a matter of perspective."}

Well, truthfully, we don't know what his name is; he merely adopts the name when he has to.

Such denizens include lizards, iguanas, moles, mice, armadillos, rabbits, Gila monsters, and tortoises. You know, desert critters.

After all, it's an animated film that kids are going to be interested in, so don't expect a lot of violence or a detailed plot. It's not important.\nWhat is important, and what truly makes this a wonderful film, is Depp. If I didn't know any better - and I don't, really - I would swear he was ad-libbing all of his lines. Depp's patter is rapid, intelligent, witty, and delightful. Often, if an actor improvises and isn't up to it, you'll darn well notice - none of the made-up lines connect with each other or the rest of the movie, jokes fall flat. Hey, actors aren't usually writers as well. But if he or she is good at improv, then you get lines that seem even more natural than the scripted variety. For the record, John Logan wrote the screenplay, and since he was nominated this year for writing Martin Scorsese's Hugo, I think we can assume that the words we hear Depp speak are indeed from the pen of Mr. Logan. Most of them, anyway.\nGood supporting cast, too, including a creepy, oily turn by Bill Nighy as a rattlesnake; Beatty as the tortoise-mayor (who might remind one of Noah Cross in Chinatown); Isla Fisher as Beans, the nominal love interest who has catatonia as a defense mechanism; and Alfred Molina as a run-over 'dillo. Directing the shenanigans (his first animated feature) is Gore Verbinski, who directed Depp in three Pirates of the Caribbean movies.\nKids will like this movie, although maybe those who are fans of shoot- em-up cartoons will take a greater shine to it than those who like love stories, but we're not going to stereotype here. Truth is, Beans is one of the toughest characters in the movie, much more so than poor Rango. In any event, Rango contains some scenes that may frighten small children (scenes involving the rattlesnake Jake, for example), but much more action and comedy than anything else, and even for jaded moviegoers it's a lot of fun to watch."}

That movie was The Cave, and although I regarded it as a flawed movie, I found it entertaining. James Cameron, on the other hand, thought it needed 3D and even more ludicrous dialog. And so he gave us Sanctum.\nIt's almost the same setup. Super-duper spelunkers dive into a deep hole, and then a storm hits, and it floods the deep hole, and the survivors are trapped. (Meaning it also uses elements of The Abyss, another exponentially better movie.) How ever will they escape their fate? Through sometimes-literally blind luck, it would seem, plus some rippling biceps and a deep disregard for human life. Man must press on! Emotions are not going to save us!\nSanctum recycles all sorts of time-honored clich\u00e9s, such as the son who resents the father but somehow does the same death-defying junk his dad does anyway. That'll show him. On this particular trip - a mission to find a secret passage from said giant hole that leads to the ocean - are, of course, the mission's financier; the crusty, hardcore dad/leader; the surly yet skilled son; the financier's girlfriend, who is naturally inexperienced; and sundry characters who we barely get to know. Which is fine.\nBearing in mind that this was shown in 3D in the theater, I knew I was supposedly missing out on some effects. But considering that 3D technology actually works best when there is light, filming underwater cave scenes in 3D was a pretty senseless waste of the gimmick. Now that I've seen it at home, I'm sure I missed nothing by skipping it on the big screen. Sure, there are exciting scenes of water falling and flowing and rising and people gasping and diving and breathing, but there's no real sense of claustrophobia, like one would get from a movie such as The Descent. The movie's well shot, it's just lacking in, well, depth. To pun a little.\nSo even though some of the effects are pretty good, the dialog leaves much to be desired. What I desired was coherency, for example; apparently the characters are all Australian, but their accents to my ears came off as nearly unintelligible when combined with the roaring deluge precipitated (ha!) by the cyclone on terra firma. Even when things are quiet, I had trouble figuring out the dialog, and when I did understand it, I quickly concluded it wasn't worth understanding. This is the sort of movie where you hear lines like \"Go on without me!\" and \"There's no way out!\" and \"We can't just leave him here!\" and so on.\nMany people had high hopes for this movie. James Cameron! 3D! What could go wrong? Nothing, if you expect the same. Sanctum isn't a pretty movie, it's not a kind movie, it's not a funny movie, and the action scenes are almost incomprehensible. It's full of stupid people making dumb choices and smart people bullying everyone else. There's probably some message in there about a son and father reconnecting after some estrangement, but it's a lost, diluted, muddied message, which is no mean feat to pull off. Simply put, there's no good reason to waste time or money on Sanctum."}

Doesn't matter what for, what the odds are, if it's immoral or illegal, it's what he does. Perhaps that's a metaphor for his life, where he sees himself with one purpose and an incentive to be the very best at his vocation. We're led to believe that he exists to drive.\nHe seems to split his time into three jobs: Hollywood stuntman, mechanic, and getaway car driver. One pays better than the others. He works with people with whom he's had little to no prior contact, and he has some rules. He gets his way, because he truly is a terrific driver with pinpoint reflexes. He says little, listens much, and does his job. Sort of the perfect employee, except for the times when one of his little rules is violated. But if they aren't, he will deliver your package on time.\nThe Driver's life experiences no real bumps until he meets one of his neighbors, Irene (Carey Mulligan), who's apparently a single mom/waitress. They become friends, but nothing more. He helps her when her car breaks down, and she - what luck! - brings it to the garage where he and his boss Shannon (Bryan Cranston) work. Irene confesses that she's not single; her husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) is in jail for reasons unknown. It is giving nothing away to mention that in short time Standard is released and confronts The Driver. But then they become friends, because why not? The Driver likes Irene, and she digs him, as does her kid, but he intuits that Standard, although full of bluster and machismo and probably running with the wrong people, isn't a terrible person. The Driver has no real need to rescue Irene. But, as he quickly learns, Standard does need to be rescued.\nIt appears that The Driver does more than just drive. He cares. He's deadly with his hands and other objects. He can break into cars and elude police. He's tough but reticent. Very reticent, willing to let others dig their own holes before he dives in. He acts without telegraphing his move to everyone, particularly the audience. He's still wildly existential, but now it seems he exists as a man playing by rules of which only he is truly aware.\nGosling is really something. Rather than giving us the impression that, because of his silence, he is dim witted or vulnerable, he shows us that there is much beneath his handsome exterior. We never know his motives other than a desire to help Irene, Standard, and their little boy - in fact, that motive alone seems to a new one on The Driver himself. Does it enrich him? Yes, but only because he mentions it himself; otherwise, he's the same cipher he's always been. Gosling's Driver isn't just a blank-faced object of desire; one can tell he's thinking about something, forming a plan, keeping it hidden deep within. I kind of wish he'd garnered an Oscar nom out of this performance.\nBut he's not alone. Mulligan is excellent as the haunted, torn Irene - much better than she was in the ill-fated Shame from last year or even from An Education. She's sweet and cute but not naive and not the proverbial sex bomb. Cranston and Ron Perlman have showy roles as good and bad guys. But stealing the show - almost the entire movie - is Albert Brooks, yes, the comedian who has dabbled in dramatic acting in the past, who is unbelievable as Cranston's mob contact. He's terrifying but methodical, a horrifying combination if ever there was one.\nDrive is a work of art in many ways. It's meticulously edited by Mat Newman, and the sound is blended perfectly by the team of Lon Bender and Victor Ray Ennis, with the latter two earning Oscar nominations for themselves. Nicholas Winding Refn's direction is crisp, unyielding, confrontational, and engaging, particularly for one's first Big Movie. \nThere's much to like in Drive if you're a fan of adrenaline-enhanced experiences that don't bludgeon you with CGI and other fakery. The level of realism is just right, both in the action scenes and in the person- to-person scenes."}

It's intended to shock, and in many scenes it is successful. It's a moody, psychologically scarring throwback to the old Roger Corman movies based on Edgar Allan Poe stories, with an amazing adult performance by Daniel Radcliffe as a young lawyer out of his depth. \nArthur Kipps (Radcliffe), a down-on-his-luck attorney, is asked to travel to a remote village and find out if a recently deceased woman has left any heretofore unknown wills. It's Kipps' last shot at success, his employer sternly warns him. His journey to the village is eerily similar to that undertaken by Jonathan Harker in Bram Stoker's Dracula. Something's not quite right with the town, which clearly doesn't want him around, something to do with children being murdered and people blaming a dead woman. You know how it is.\nKipps' sleuthing leads to more and more questions. Who was the woman (ostensibly, his client), really? What relationship did she have with the town? And what of those treacherous marshes, and that long and winding road to the main house that is impassable when the tide is in? Why is it that every time Kipps turns around, a shadow darts away? Understanding that these are all staples of the great horror movies of yore doesn't mean that this film is stealing; it is merely authentically replicating the desolate atmosphere, in which a whisper can signal death.\nI entered the theater knowing very little of the movie's content. Was it to be a mystery, and we'd find out who the titular woman was at some point? It is, and we do, but that is only part of the puzzle. The best horror movies, in my opinion, are the ones that build just the right amount of suspense and then pull the rug out from under the viewer. A slow buildup must have a satisfying payoff. Showing the evil the lurks in every other scene dilutes the fright quotient. This movie doesn't do that. It pulls no punches to our psyche. \nIt is so closely shot by Tim Maurice-Jones, who's best known for his work with Guy Ritchie. Maurice-Jones' style here is to capture almost every shot from Kipps' perspective, thus bringing the audience that much closer to the terror he's supposed to be feeling. Radcliffe, to his credit, never comes off as some innocent lad who's just starting out in the business, and although Kipps is perplexed - much like Edward Woodward's character in The Wicker Man - he is determined to see things through, even though he has strayed a bit from his original mission. \nSomething is definitely wrong here, and it involves the children. Are they to blame for the nefarious goings-on? Are their parents? No one is saying anything. To make matters worse for Kipps, he has a young son of his own, whose mother died in childbirth and who is coming to visit Kipps in a few days. The grief felt by the parents of the fallen children only heightens Kipps' own fears. \nThere are several moments that, on the Internet, would be called shock videos. Everything seems normal, and then BAM, something pops out of nowhere. In lesser movies, this might be seen as a crutch, a way to stun your senses to get a particular reaction, but here it all fits in, and it conveys mortal terror. The Woman in Black's identity is revealed very early in the film, so the mystery isn't who she is but why these events keep occurring. Is it all superstition, or is there something more to the spiritual aspect of the plot?\nThe ending is tidy and satisfying, but it is by no means conventional or predictable. In fact, it opens up even more questions. But more importantly, director James Watkins and screenwriter Jane Goldman (based on a book by Susan Hill) do not take the easy way out. People do not necessarily live happily ever after. Story threads are not necessarily sewn up tight. It is a riveting film steeped in a macabre atmosphere teeming with the potential of death with every slow approach to a corner or a locked door."}

It is not really for kids (they'll get bored by the plot), although it sustains a level of wonder and joy you don't expect from a Martin Scorsese film. Hugo will rekindle a love for the movies for some and open up an entirely new universe to others. Hugo (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan who lives in a train station, making sure the giant clocks all run on time. He's been deserted by his soused uncle (Ray Winstone), and his parents are long gone. Hugo is alone with his clock machinery and some various doodads from his father, including an old automaton that had been programmed to write and draw. The automaton requires a special key to be activated, and once Hugo locates said key, the real mystery, involving the proverbial wheels within wheels, just like clockwork, is afoot.\nAs an orphan, Hugo must steal food in order to live. He also takes tools so he can work on the automaton, and he's caught by a toymaker named Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s (Ben Kingsley). M\u00e9li\u00e8s has a granddaughter, played by Chloe Grace Moretz, who takes pity on the poor Hugo and helps him in his quest to solve the riddle of the automaton. When Isabelle and Hugo finally do get the automaton working, they find their plans shifting from a connection between the automaton and Hugo's late father and to the previous owner of the automaton, who identity shall remain a mystery here.\nI'm not a paid reviewer, so I figure it's okay if I take the cheap route and offer up a bad pun. The movie is timely. More than 100 years have passed since the invention of motion pictures, and there are so many people who have no idea what those early films were like. Scorsese, a longtime movie historian, knows all too well his audience, and he gradually allows them to assimilate within the friendly confines of a boy-with-a-mysterious-past story before inviting them into the early world of movies.\nThis is a 3D movie, by the way, and it's the rarest of birds \u2013 the kind in which the 3D doesn't attack you like you owe it even more money but rather the kind you don't notice until you need to notice it. Scorsese, ever the perfectionist, uses the medium to its utmost, with a terrific sense of when to hold back and when to hold forth. Not bad at all for his first foray into the new hip way of shooting movies. So, for me, the 3D version of this film is definitely worthwhile.\nBy the final 20 minutes or so of the movie, I was absolutely entranced by what had by then become an homage to older films, to the very dawn of cinema. Scorsese takes great pains to show how difficult it was for fledgling filmmakers to make a movie look so easy. No special effects, no budget, handmade costumes \u2013 it was like working with a small grammar school. At one point we are shown an early reel, from the nineteen- aughts, and it's in color. A character explains that although the movie was shot in black and white, the crew painstakingly hand-colored various scenes to add a touch of tint. It's a beautiful detail that I assume is true, as Scorsese, in the framework of a lost-child plot, seeks to educate those of us who are not film historians.\nAnd by the end of the movie, the wonderful, poignant performances by Kingsley, Butterfield, Moretz, and Helen McCrory dissolved my senses. There are several touching moments in the waning minutes of the film, and the cast hits all of the right notes. Hugo would serve as a poetic coda if this were the end of the great director's career, but even so it's a love note to the world of movies, translated for a wide, new audience."}

I'm totally cool with that. I find the books funny enough without being degrading, intelligently written, and full of excellent, memorable characters. So I was more than a little leery when I heard that the first book in the series would be translated to the big screen, and even leerier when it was announced that perpetually petulant Katherine Heigl would play the lead role. I'm happy to report that she's not miscast, that she has the Jersey attitude and look down very well (although perhaps still a little too pretty for how I'd imagined Stephanie Plum). In fact, I was pleasantly surprised to see that Heigl actually elevated the movie - which she needed to do, because it's not a plot-heavy movie with strong special effects. \nStephanie Plum is down on her luck when we first meet her. She's just been fired as a lingerie saleswoman at Macy's. She lives in a lower- middle-class part of Trenton, New Jersey known as The Burg. She has a hectic family life. Her car's about to be repossessed, and she's behind on her rent. Her mom suggests she go work for her cousin Vinnie (Patrick Fischler), who owns a bail-bonds company. The opening is for file clerk - up Stephanie's alley - but turns out that's a dead end. All they have is bounty hunter, so our glamour gal takes the job. \nPlum's first skip is a cop named Joe Morelli, who's suspected of shooting an unarmed man to death. If Steph can bring Morelli in, she gets 10% of the bond, which is $500,000. $50,000 can go a long way if you have bills to pay. Trouble is, there's a history between Plum and Morelli (Jason O'Mara); seems that he took her virginity in high school and never called and that she ran him over with her car shortly thereafter. You know, normal stuff. Oh, but she's just in this for the money.\nWe meet some interesting characters along the way. One of Plum's coworkers is a freelancer named Ranger (Daniel Sunjata), who knows all, sort of a ninja who actually does use guns. And then there's Lula (Sherri Shepherd), the talkative hooker who can be bought off with snacks. For my money - no pun intended - the wackiest character in the book is Stephanie's Gramma Mazur, played here by the indomitable Debbie Reynolds, and although she's toned down a little for the movie, she still gets some of the funniest lines and scenes. \nI think that, despite a fairly blah plot (and a sort of dumb ending - guts are figuratively spilled), the movie is indeed saved by Heigl. How this is possible is a mystery. I've never liked her on-screen personas, but here she seems to be more immersed in the role than ever before. Hey, I am from New Jersey. I know Jersey girls. Heigl hits most of the notes pretty damn well. At no time - and this is no small feat - does she come across as a smart-ass, sexier-than-thou princess. Stephanie Plum the character is supposed to be cute/sexy, but not a goddess and most certainly not one with high self esteem. The screen version of her matches the book version fairly well.\nThis might be a movie that people can wait to watch at home. It's not necessarily a big-screen adventure, and I'm glad the studio didn't promote it as one or insist on a lot of explosions (although there are some good ones). It doesn't deviate from its premise - cupcake takes on tough-guy job - and delivers exactly what it promises as a result. Heigl, for once, is much better than the script and keeps the movie afloat. Have to give credit where it's due. John Leguizamo and Fisher Stevens show up in small, but pivotal roles. O'Mara, by the way, is a dead ringer for a young Mel Gibson, complete with charm. \nOne for the Money is a flawed movie. Some might argue that it takes way too little time for the girly girl Stephanie to know how to handle bad guys, including firearms. Some might say that its ending is predictable. They'd all be right. But overall it's not as bad as I'd expected."}

Ball.", "content": "I think the first thing you need to realize about Moneyball is that it's not really a baseball movie at all. It's about innovation in the face of intractable, tradition-bound, go-by-the-gut senses. New thinking versus old thinking. In presenting the view that concentrating on why a particular player is more valuable to a team than another, rather than on his star power or high-profile personality or the number of home runs he's hit is not only prudent but necessary when a team has little money to spend, the movie is an unqualified success. Billy Beane (Brad Pitt, nominated for an Oscar) is the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, a team with a small payroll that must compete with bigger-market teams like the Yankees and Red Sox. The Athletics are not unsuccessful, but they can't quite win it all. When three of their big stars leave via free agency one off season, Beane decides to replace them with players who are not only affordable but who can offer, in composite, more return than the departing trio. Beane's reasoning is that in order to win, a team must score runs. To score runs, a player must get on base. Getting on base is the single most important part of winning. So while other teams make use of players who can hit home runs and steal bases (and pay said players countless millions), Oakland goes after players who can simply get on base.\nThat this is anathema to the Way the Game Is Played would be an understatement. No one's really paid attention to the more obscure statistics, like OBP (on-base percentage), because who cares? Give me 40 home runs and a 120 RBI, and we'll win. Well, Oakland can't afford that guy, so how about three guys who combined make less than that guy but get on base more often. That's more practical.\nBeane is assisted by virtually no one. His manager, Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffmann) despises Beane's attempts to manipulate the batting order to his liking. His scouts are all stuck in the mud of 1932 and refuse to change. Even the players are a little skeptical. But Peter Brand (Jonah Hill, also nominated for an Oscar), gets it. A true stats nerd \u2013 he majored in economics at Yale \u2013 Brand understands the weaknesses and strengths better than any general manager, field manager, or player ever could, because he's crunched the numbers and has data to back up his assertions.\nPitt and Hill are both amazing and have excellent on-screen chemistry. That's not a sentence I figured I'd ever type. Hill isn't playing just some nebbish who cowers in front of Beane or a player; he's his own man, just a little withdrawn and seemingly out of his element. Both actors take great pains to involve the audience in their stories; otherwise, this would be just a movie about pencil-necked geeks playing simulated games on a computer and expecting the real world to do the same.\nThe movie takes place in 2002 and is based on fact, but even so I won't spoil the ending for you now. But I will note this much for sure: Beane's overall philosophy has been adapted to such a wide extent over the past decade that Oakland now must find a new angle to exploit that the bigger teams haven't yet found. The very idea that there are more important stats than the typical power numbers turns baseball upside down, shakes it hard, and collects the loose change. To use a clich\u00e9, this was a teachable moment for baseball executives across America, and although it took a while for many to catch on, catch on they did.\nEven if one removed the many baseball scenes, the movie would still work. It's honest, true to itself, and doesn't digress into meaningless side plots, like forced romance or witty banter. But the baseball action, the result of Beane's work behind the scenes, sells it completely."}

The law of diminishing returns usually applies here. You know the characters, you know the premise, you know there will be a plethora of explosions and perhaps some bon mots. And that's all you want out of escapist, popcorn movies. The new Mission:Impossible movie flouts those conventions, though. Sure, its plot is straightforward (only one man can stop the end of the world!), but the stunts and the spectacular cinematography complement the story, rather than point to its threadbare nature.\nIn Mission:Impossible - Ghost Protocol, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is imprisoned in Serbia. We don't know why, but maybe we'll find out later. Unsurprisingly, he's busted out by fellow agents Benji (Simon Pegg) and Carter (Paula Patton). It seems some bad guy has his hands on a nuclear device and needs only the launch codes, but when Hunt and his team infiltrate the Kremlin to retrieve them... well, the place blows up. The Impossible Missions Force is blamed and disbanded, as the U.S. president (fearing repercussions from Moscow) invokes Ghost Protocol, and the team is left on its own to Save the World.\nThe events take place sometime after those in M:I 3, in which Ethan Hunt quits the IMF. Well, here we are again, so perhaps that was just a decoy, huh? But it's not a simple matter of trying to make the audience forget Hunt had quit; that plot idiosyncrasy is explained. Luckily for us, it's not a driving force behind the plot, which is just a long-hand way of saying that although this one follows that one and refers to events in that one, it doesn't negate that one at all - it plays off it. Trust me, it'll make more sense once you see the movie.\nThe must-find-bad-guys-to-save-self/save-the-world plot is not really new, but the way it dovetails with the subplots (i.e., what happened to Hunt after M:I III and other pieces) is surprisingly well done. Added to the mix is an analyst, played by Jeremy Renner, who finds himself sucked into Hunt's mission and who may not be who he says he is. It's a movie in which we're not left guessing about the big things (e.g., who's the bad guy, what's he up to) but rather about the small things (what does X have to do with Y, what does Y know that we don't).\nI saw this movie in an IMAX theater, and for once the effect is well used. Here's a prime example. Ethan Hunt needs to get to a computer server room within the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Trouble is, he can't access it from the inside. In case you're not familiar, the Burj Khalifa is 2,716.5 feet tall. That's more than half a mile. Ethan needs to scale it (although, luckily, not the entire height). He uses these suction gloves: thwop, thwop, thwop. And while he's doing this, we're treated to a dizzying look at the skyscrapers below him; because of the huge screen, it really felt as if the theater were tilting, rather than the camera. Excellent work. Every explosion, every pounding is amplified; when glass shatters, you duck - and the movie's not even in 3D. \nCruise is Tom Cruise. He is not, as I am fond of saying, an actor - he is a movie star. Ethan Hunt is a hugely successful character for him, but he's not without some flaws. In fact, I think it can be said that there's more to Hunt in this installment than there was before, and somehow Cruise is able to make us feel, well, concern for him. Sure, he's in charge, but he has his demons. Cruise doesn't overact here. In fact, he even slows the tempo down a bit, as if he's realized that sometimes saying nothing is better than saying something. Sure, he grits his teeth and defies all laws of physics, but he does seem to be bringing a little more to Hunt's character, psychologically, than we'd seen before. Big plus.\nMission:Impossible - Ghost Protocol is a near-perfect action/spy thriller. There is plenty of intrigue, and you shouldn't be able to guess it all at first blush. It is a plausible, if not remarkable, plot. Its stuntwork - some performed by Cruise - is staggering to behold. If there ever was a movie that made your jaw drop at times, it's this one. They even manage to mix in a huge sandstorm, which is in itself a little scary. (Side note: how do real Dubai people deal with these things? In the movie they appear to be driving off the road as if they'd never seen one before.) Tom Cruise updates his usual Action Man character with some mental issues, and it works. He has an able supporting cast - great comic relief from Pegg, as usual, and the delectable Patton as a woman with issues of her own - and boggling special effects to move things along. This is definitely a movie best appreciated on the big screen."}

Brandon's reaction is a little more of the enraged type, but he merely bottles it up and stomps away after closing the door. There's a lot of door slamming in the movie.\nOver the course of the movie, we get some clues to the nature of the siblings' relationship. They have been out of touch for some time, although Sissy does have her brother's apartment key. She's flirty and works as a torch singer in various New York clubs. He seems to be perpetually seething at her immature behavior. Is it because she's disrupting his happy fun time, or is it something more\u0085decadent? The movie's title gives us an idea.\nThe movie promises to be intriguing. Why have these two been apart? Where has Sissy been, and why does Brandon hold her in such contempt? We're supposed to assume that his constant masturbating and hooker- engaging portends something, a way perhaps of acting out an emotion or two. But what? We're never told. The hints are there, and one can make an educated guess to the root of the problems, but it's a fool's errand. It's not just that we might not find out the entire truth, we might not find out anything, period. That leaves us with two opposite characters who, under less-profane circumstances, could have starred in a buddy sitcom about mismatched roomies.\nThe movie looks grimy and feels slimy. You want to take a long bath afterward, not a cold shower \u2013 despite the frequent sex and nudity. Sometimes, the movie shows us one thing, leading us to one conclusion, and then shows us a different conclusion. Whammo, you've been hit by a red herring. There's more depravity in here than there was in Abel Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant but without the compelling plot. Novice director Steve McQueen (no relation) seems to have little idea on how to end a scene, as long silences seem pointless rather than pointed. People stare at each other, then off into space, as if this meant something. Maybe it does. You won't care.\nShame is an ugly mess. It's an unhappy, inconsolable wreck of a movie. It's not a train wreck from which one cannot avert one's eyes; it's just a generic wreck that is faceless, dispassionate, and distant."}

If any of them bother to watch The Artist, the chances should be astronomical. This is more than a work of art. It surpasses the medium and our expectations. First, let me explain about the mechanics of the movie. Like its ancestors, it is not really silent; music accompanies just about every scene. Sometimes title cards appear to indicate what a character has said, but these are employed infrequently. Even ambient noise, like a cup being placed on a table, are not heard. Each actor \"speaks\" his lines, and the most basic ones are easily understood by the expressions. It's not as difficult to follow as it may sound.\nIn The Artist, Jean Dujardin plays a silent-film actor named George Valentin (sort of a cross between Rudolf Valentino and Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.). He is the star of his time and makes a good living. He's married to his frequent costar, played by Penelope Anne Miller, and he has an adorable Jack Russell terrier (a nod to the Thin Man movies). In an instance of kismet, he meets fan/aspiring actress Peppy Miller (B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo), for whom he finds a job as an extra in his movie as a dancer (her name itself is probably a nod to the great Ann Miller). And meanwhile, his wife Doris is, shall we say, unhappy with George, noticing the chemistry between him and his new friend.\nReminiscent of A Star Is Born, Peppy becomes popular while, with the advent of talkies, George becomes less employable. No one wants to hear people talk, he rants at his boss (John Goodman). He vows to make his own movie \u2013 silent \u2013 with his own money. It opens on the same date as Peppy's big film, and it doesn't do well.\nThe plot is a simple rise-fall-rebirth drama. Its lack of complexity is a huge asset here, as so much must be expressed visually. And what visuals! The elegant shots from cinematographer Guillaume Schiffman evoke sympathy, stark reality, compassion, humor, and love almost effortlessly. The music is beautiful and well selected. This is a movie about movies, after all, and, much like Singin' in the Rain was about one actor's approach to the new-fangled talking pictures, The Artist shows us a different approach: George Valentin, realizing his career as he knows it cannot continue, simultaneously understands that he is not fit for the future, either. He cannot change, can he? Who, indeed, would want to hear him talk?\nI mentioned earlier that virtually no words are spoken. As in Mel Brooks' Silent Movie, there is some dialog near the very end of the movie. But Dujardin and Bejo are so astounding, graceful, and sparkling on screen that no sound is needed, let alone actual words. They are a remarkable couple, she with the big eyes, coquettish wink, and impish personality, and he with the debonair stare, the chiseled chin, and all the raging self confidence that a stylish leading man should have. They are perfect in this movie.\nI cannot stress how powerful and moving this movie is. It's a stunning achievement and wildly entertaining. It's enthralling, capturing a far- off time with impeccable, glistening accuracy. Director Michel Hanzanavicius doesn't miss a step in directing his cast \u2013 some of whom are quite seasoned. There's Goodman as the studio head and Miller as the wife, and other familiar faces show up, such as Missi Pyle, James Cromwell, Ed Lauter, and Malcolm McDowell. Hanzanavicius' movie isn't just evocative of the old 1920s films \u2013 it really seems to transport you to a theater in the early part of the 20th century. It's a lavish, loving film that is absolutely packed with emotional scenes. It is, at turns, joyous and devastating, but it is always, always a huge treat to watch. It is, most definitely, one of the very best films of 2011."}
< {"rating": "9", "date": "7 January 2012", "title_id": "tt1655420", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "Delightful, soaring performance by Williams", "content": "It's all there: the swishy walk, the breathy voice, the knowing wink. Michelle Williams, in a gracious, tender, seminal performance, hits all the right notes in her performance as the eminently fragile Marilyn Monroe and the effect she had on a young employee on the set of the 1957 movie The Prince and the Showgirl. This is a truly wonderful film, heart stopping in its humanizing of one of the 20th century's most prominent cinematic icons. It's gloriously shot and is filled with ample Britishness by stalwarts like Kenneth Branagh and Judi Dench.\nBy 1957, Monroe was a Movie Star. But she yearned to be an actor, not just a sex symbol. This led her to accept the lead in Laurence Olivier's The Prince and the Showgirl. Now, imagine this for a moment. Imagine you're a good little worker bee and suddenly get a promotion to interact with the bigwigs at your office. They expect you to be at least as good as advertised - only you're too overwhelmed and terrified to do anything other than wreak havoc. This is sort of what happened when Monroe arrived, belatedly, on set. She brings along her publicist and, more importantly, her acting coach, Paula Strasberg, wife to Lee Strasberg. Monroe was habitually late to rehearsals and read-throughs and frequently flubbed her lines, causing much consternation among the cast the crew - and certainly most of all to the movie's director and star, Olivier (Branagh). It is during this most turbulent time in her life that she chances upon a lowly \"third assistant director,\" played by Eddie Redmayne, who's simply happy to be there.\nMonroe and Colin (Redmayne) develop a rapport. The public image of Monroe, of course, was that she was all about sex. Sex and being sexual were her top priorities, right? And yet she was trying so hard to become more than just a curvy beauty. She desperately wanted to be accepted by her peers and knew that the pedigree that Olivier and many of his cast carried could be very helpful to her career, if not her psyche. But almost immediately, she runs into trouble. Why? Because she is a movie star who wishes to become an actress, and the stage-trained actors around her wish they were movie stars. On top of that, Olivier himself was no babe in the woods and was himself trying to regain his lost youth, believing that working with Monroe would help reinvigorate him.\nThe friendship that Colin and Monroe enjoy is, for the most part, platonic. Monroe feels that Colin understands her and is sympathetic to her plight. She feels boxed in, with no one to trust, nearly alone on foreign soil among some of the best actors in England. And, of course, already starting down the path to physical ruin by taking pills to sleep, pills to stay awake, pills to exist. But somehow she senses assurance, support, and most of all, love from her younger friend. (In an amusing line, Monroe tells Colin that she's the first man she's kissed who's younger than she is.)\nWilliams' singular performance is breathtaking and will simply blow you away. She captures the heart of the character so impeccably, infusing her simultaneously with almost casual elegance and raw vulnerability. Marilyn Monroe has been portrayed many times by many fine actresses, but Williams seems to redefine the character not as an actress and not as an ing\u00e9nue, but rather as a loving, feeling woman suffering from acute stress.\nThe supporting cast is more than capable, too. Redmayne has this dullard look about him, true, but he is a perfect match as Colin for Williams' Monroe; he's naive without being innocent, never self-righteous and willing to risk consequences to help a person in need. Branagh is terrific as the aging Olivier (in 1957, even!), a man used to getting his own way but who had never been up against the likes of Marilyn Monroe before. Dame Judi Dench, as Dame Sybil Thorndike (a legend on the London stage) is properly rebellious as always, supportive of Monroe for all the right reasons. \nMy Week with Marilyn - again, based on a true story - is a spellbinding, must-see movie. You don't have to be a movie fan to love this movie. At its heart, it is about relationships among people with different sets of problems, some seeking solace and some offering support. It's a terrific film."}

The first hour or so seems to move quickly, until you realize that nothing has really happened to further the plot in a coherent manner, and it quickly devolves into a quagmire of overcomplications and double crosses, culminating in an ending that strives to be all things to all people and fails at being much of anything. It's a pretty film with pretty actors doing a pretty good job, and that's about it. Johnny Depp plays Frank Tupelo, the titular traveler who has an \"accidental\" interaction with a femme fatale named Elise Clifton-Ward, played by the ever-luminous Angelina Jolie. Thankfully, for once Jolie doesn't play a Lara Croft character who is Just Plain Awesome at everything; her Elise is certainly more worldly and in command than Depp's Frank, but she's not necessarily a superwoman/robot, if such a thing existed. (I think it does.) Elise involves Frank in an intricate spy-versus-spy plot in which he's unwittingly being tapped to impersonate her husband, who's wanted by gangsters, Scotland Yard, Interpol, and probably his local library. Because Elise is so outlandishly gorgeous, Frank just dumbly goes along with it. I don't blame him for it. He follows her around, does what she says. If Angelina Jolie told me to come with her to an expensive hotel in Venice, I could definitely see myself giving it careful consideration, for sure.\nUnlike many other movies in which the protagonists race around wildly from gorgeous locale to gorgeous locale, pausing only to make out a little bit here and there, this one has the twist \u2013 using that loosely \u2013 that Elise's husband hasn't been seen in a long time and is presumed to have changed his appearance through extensive surgery. So you can see how Depp can just step in and fill his shoes.\nIf you watch this movie, you'll be enraptured with the lead performances and little else. Depp plays clueless rather well, and Jolie is probably the Elizabeth Taylor of her generation. Taylor always seemed to be known first as a pretty face with unbelievable violet eyes and then as a damn fine actress. Jolie's the same in many respects. I don't think she knows how to phone in a performance. Okay, maybe The Bone Collector. Anyway, at least she gets to don several beautiful, expensive outfits.\nThe ending just doesn't feel right, either. It sort of makes you feel as if you've been had, and that's the worst kind of ending: a gyp. These spy movies can be complex, wheels-within-wheels ordeals, but that can work if the little details you overlook at first add up to something in the end. If you get a complex story that winds up being made out of papier-mache, then it's a sad, unfit ending. This is the kind of movie whose ending makes you slap your face with a \"Oh, THAT's what I get?\" That's not a compliment."}

But there's a big difference between seeing a movie that depicts events through which you lived and one that's basically history to you. All the President's Men, for example, was a great, great film, but I have a different perspective than someone who was my current age in 1973. Time changes that perspective. When we're closer to an event, our perspective is blurred, subjective, and nebulous. The importance we place on an event shortly after it occurs may well wane in the ensuing years \u2013 or, in some cases, grow stronger. When the movie version of All the President's Men came out, a turning point was reached: trusting the government was no longer the default position for mainstream America. Fair Game, based on the true story of the outing of an undercover CIA operative, is set less than a decade ago. Our innocence of government- as-our-protector is long gone; so, too, is our faith in the media to cover issues thoughtfully, to uncover true corruption. That's just how our perspective is now. In forty years, things may have swung the other way entirely.\nBecause many aspects of life are now so very polarized, we approach a movie like this much differently than its predecessors. Here are the facts: a war was unleashed based on faulty information. A man who had been sent to verify that information (and found it faulty), angered that his assessment was twisted, wrote an Op-Ed article explaining himself. It turned out that the man's wife was an undercover CIA agent and that she had been asked to recommend his mission to verify the information. In apparent retaliation for this act, certain powerful people revealed the real name and address of the covert agent. Had this issue been presented in 1973, our lonely eyes would have turned to the press to sort it out, as Woodward and Bernstein did with Watergate (through a lot of hard work). Those days are gone, and we are left to decide for ourselves what is true and what is not.\nThe movie certainly has a slant to it. Most viewers will have already decided for themselves whether that slant reflects reality or fantasy, as these events were not small scale and under the radar. My personal belief is that the movie is factual (to the degree at which it is trustworthy), and that itself depresses me. That's because, unlike All the President's Men, this story not only has no happy ending, it's an ongoing tale that, as it progresses, makes one feel worse by the second.\nThis is the kind of movie that Warren Beatty would have been in during the 1970s \u2013 it has a good Parallax View feel to it \u2013 and its star, Sean Penn, is no stranger to voicing his opinion on matters politic. If you find his view unsettling, then this movie has nothing to offer you. We know the ending (to date). We know the results. So how much we enjoy this movie depends wholly on how much we identify with the viewpoints of both Penn's character (former Ambassador Joe Wilson, sent to verify the information) and that of Naomi Watts (the outed agent). Are they themselves trustworthy? Do you sympathize with them, or do you feel they brought their own problems onto themselves? We know what the movie wants us to believe. What we wind up believing is probably going to differ from moviegoer to moviegoer.\nThe movie is prefaced by a short speech to the camera by the actual former agent, Valerie Plame, and concludes with her actual testimony to Congress on the matter. But this is not supposed to be a documentary, and I presume that some of the facts have been fudged to make things more cinematic. I can live with that. What does that leave us, then? Passion, compassion, the validity of truth, the arrogance of power, and other writ-large themes. And, it should be mentioned, two terrific, heart-felt performances by Penn and Watts, who as usual inhabit their roles, becoming less actors and more players in a drama that's beyond their comprehension.\nAs pure entertainment, Fair Game isn't at the top of the heap. It's not that it drags, it's that it's hanging its hat on events in progress, a moving target of a point. It never meanders, but its endgame is obvious and knowable. What really saves it, believe it or not, are two crucial scenes near the end, scenes that are powerful in their circumspection and their emotion. Watching those two particular scenes wasn't easy; both Penn and Watts have a way of grabbing you with their characters here and embracing you \u2013 not in an effort to get you on their side but simply to feel something, anything."}

It's a time capsule, and it's a highly informative one for those of us who weren't there. It's a jumping-off point to explain the lovefests, the Be-Ins, the protests, the marches, the Woodstocks, and the Altamonts. It's a relic of its time as well, but it's also a genuine look at a mostly far-gone time.\nIt's 1964. The sixties, we're told, didn't really begin in 1960 (or 1961) but rather in November of 1963, when Kennedy was killed. The nation's innocence was lost, and the younger souls - our baby boomers - looked for something to help guide them into the future. The plastic days of picket-fenced houses and nuclear families were disappearing. People needed something new. That something new, it turned out, was LSD - a perfectly legal substance at the time.\nKen Kesey was the author of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, a writer of some reknown. In '63, he and a few friends were visiting New York City and witnessed the preparations for the following year's World's Fair. Kesey, who lived in Oregon, determined on the spot that he'd grab some people and make a trip across America to the fair. The group would up too big for a station wagon, so an old International Harvester bus was procured and customized, including plenty of filming equipment. The bus was painted in an array of bright, friendly, psychedelic colors, and off they went.\nThe group called itself the Merry Pranksters, and everyone had his or her own nickname. Along for the ride was Neil Cassady. Never heard of him? You should read Jack Kerouac's novel On the Road; the character of Dean Moriarity was based on Cassady. Cassady was a real character, a speed-taking oddity who drove like a maniac and had zillions of stories to tell. All he needed was an audience.\nLike most documentaries, this movie will be enjoyed best by those who were present during that era and by those who wish they were. If you're not emotionally invested in the story, you might think you're watching a bunch of wackos on drugs careen about the country, having sex every three seconds and dropping acid. You'd be right, but you might not enjoy it much. And surely not as much as the participants did.\nIf I recall, the movie uses nothing but the footage shot during the trip to New York, with some new narration by actor Stanley Tucci. This lends quite the feel of veritas to the proceedings; it's exactly like watching home movies, at least if your family is a little deranged. But drugs or not, what's interesting is that we see hardly any real conflicts - people get along, for the most part, even when some leave the trip before reaching the final destination. It's a good-vibe film, and none of it feels manufactured.\nI guess that's what I find most appealing about Magic Trip. It's honest, and it's fun. It gives you a glimpse into those sometimes twisted times - times, it should be noted, look like a cakewalk compared to what we have now. In '64, we weren't even heavily into Vietnam, and the anti- hippie tone had yet to sweep the nation. The bus got pulled over numerous times, but since hippiedom was so new, cops just figured the occupants were college kids out having fun. Ah, for those times now."}

The mood is well set, the scenes are well shot, and the thespians are at the top of their games, but the plot plods, so much so that you wind up not really caring who the bad guy turns out to be. Or, if you do care, you find that you yourself had narrowed it down to Him or The Other Guy about an hour earlier than George Smiley.\nSmiley (Gary Oldman) is a recent retiree of The Circus, the nickname for Britain's intelligence operations. More accurately, Smiley was forced out, along with the operations' leader, Control (John Hurt) when a mission in Hungary went horribly wrong. But now Britain suspects that a mole has infiltrated The Circus - and it's residing at the top of the metaphorical food chain. Smiley is brought in on the down-low to find out who the mole is and what he's up to.\nIf it seems like a standard spy film, that's because it really is. Except that in this case, Control has figured out that one of five men - the tippy-top of The Circus - is the mole. Already, then, our list of suspects is narrow. \nBecause of this, you might expect the movie to include plenty of distracting action, perhaps some crazy chase scenes, people dangling off landmarks, that sort of thing. But it's not to be. Instead, we get a somewhat painful slog through Smiley's endless detective work. There's hardly any action at all; there's a lot of thinking, which is logical given the chess-like nature of the spy business, but it doesn't often make for good cinema. In fact, there are long stretches where Smiley hardly utters a word, even in voice-over. This makes things a little tougher to follow, and I found myself overthinking the plot. The story turns out to be a lot simpler - and more simplistic - than I'd imagined.\nThe novel was adapted into a BBC miniseries in 1979. I have not seen this miniseries, which starred Alec Guinness as Smiley, but I have to imagine that because it was shown in seven parts, more time was devoted to fleshing out the characters and their motivations. It's a little easier to provide subtle details in a longer format, after all, and this big-screen version skimps on the subtleties and leaves us with dull, somnolent machinations, some of which are obvious red herrings. \nOldman, of course, makes a great George Smiley, and it's interesting how much he looks like a younger John Hurt, who here plays his superior. I don't think of Oldman as, pardon the pun, an old man, and he is only 52 years old. But he adapts a quaint, stooped mannerism to Smiley that evokes a man who's always thinking two steps ahead of his opponents. \nBut it's not enough, not even with the capable supporting cast, which includes Colin Firth, Mark Strong, and Toby Jones. There's just not a lot to figure out, and when it's figured out, it's too tidy - especially the ending, which is so obvious that it can be view from outer space, as the saying goes. Side note, though: this version contains quite a bit more blood than you'd expect (even with so little action); the level of gore in those scenes approaches the overall tone of, say, Seven. So be warned - this ain't for the kiddies.\nOverall, the adaptation is a bit of a disappointment, given the source and the talent. It manages to take a spy thriller and remove the thriller part. Less thrilling doesn't taste great."}

Due Date is, in total, neither a terrible nor an offensive film. Its problem is that it's a little too bitter, thus eliminating with surgical precision any empathy we might have for its two protagonists. It's a road trip with an obvious end in sight and somewhat unpredictable wacky hijinks in between. You could do worse, but you could do much better.\nPeter Highman (Robert Downey, Jr.) is an architect who's attempting to fly out of Atlanta back home to Los Angeles to be with his wife Michelle Monaghan, who's about to give birth. But thanks to a bag mixup with a fellow traveler named Ethan Trembley (Zach Galifianakis), Peter finds himself stranded in Atlanta, placed on the national No Fly list (minor misunderstanding, of course). Ethan offers him a cross-country ride in his rental, and off we go.\nThe movie uses the trope of mismatched people enduring a common experience. Peter is uptight, dithering endlessly about what to name his newborn. Ethan is, well, flighty. In fact, Galifianakis seems to be playing the same character he played in the two Hangover films: childlike, maybe psychopathic and/or sociopathic, not all there. He's wildly misinformed about such things as the Grand Canyon and the Hoover Dam, but he is heading west to try to make it as an actor in Hollywood. Oh, and did I mention he's carrying the ashes of his deceased father in a coffee can to dispose of along the way? Well, there's that, too.\nYou and I both know that there's no way Peter and Ethan will make it from Georgia to California without any problems. But Peter has no choice - his wallet was confiscated at the airport, and his bags are on their way to LA. He has no cash and no ID. It could happen to anyone. So he's essentially at Ethan's mercy. Along the way, we learn much about the characters and what makes them tick, but whereas the earlier Planes, Trains got melancholy without getting maudlin, this one achieves no such feat.\nDowney, Jr. and Galifianakis give it their best shot, and to tell the truth they're not bad. They make an okay team; it's just that it's a teaming we've seen before, and much better. Steve Martin and John Candy got into their share of situations that would never happen to a normal person, but they also ran into problems with which we could all relate; here, it's more of the former than the latter. It's as if the movie keeps daring itself to get weirder and weirder.\nThe final, near-fatal flaw of the movie is that it really doesn't give you anyone to root for - except of course at the end. It's a comedy, after all. But these guys do some rather nasty things to each other, and not in the oh-no-he-didn't sort of way, either; rather, in the scowling, almost hateful way. It's a little disconcerting at times. But the actors do their best, as I said, and you could do worse."}

She has experienced much in the two years in which she has been gone from the rest of the world, having disappeared without a trace, and what she has witnessed has left her so traumatized that not only can she not discuss it with her sister, she can't even begin to process what was real and what was a nightmare.\nThe movie plays out in parallel plots \u2013 the present, in which Martha (Elizabeth Olsen) has been reunited with her sister Lucy (Sarah Paulson) and Lucy's husband Ted (Hugh Dancy), and the past, in which Marcy May (also Olsen) lived with the cult/commune. Because of the intensity of her experiences, Martha finds the lines of reality and dreams to blur to the point of indistinction; she lashes out at her new family while flashing back to her old one.\nA quick word about the plot \u2013 it's almost spoilerproof. I say that because although ads had led me to believe that what had happened to Martha to cause her to be so traumatized was the thrust of the plot (that is, a mystery), it's just not so. Director/screenwriter Sean Durkin gives us a lot of information, alternating scenes between her time in the cult and her time in the present. The scenes are fairly well interwoven and make sense, but the result is that we're given too much information. There is no mystery at all. We see exactly what poor Martha has endured, and although it garners sympathy from us, it's not added sympathy; we're with her right from the beginning, when as a frightened girl she calls her estranged sister from a pay phone.\nSo while I was watching this movie, a question kept creeping into my mind: Where was this headed? We know where she's been. We know what's happened to her. We know how indoctrinated she had become in the cult. We know she's with her sister but will require serious professional help in short order. What more is there? I don't like it much when questions occur to me while I'm watching a movie, because to me it means the writer messed up somehow. I should be able to accept things for how they appear and hope that there's more to come, but when it becomes evident that there aren't really any loose ends of import remaining\u0085 well, then questions pop up, don't they? As in, what is the point?\nYou may have heard that this movie contains a rape scene. It does, and it is necessary to the plot, and it is not terribly graphic. (And make no mistake \u2013 it is a rape scene, however willingly Marcy May appears to give herself.)\nBoth Olsen and John Hawkes (as the leader of the cult) deliver astoundingly powerful performances. This isn't a surprise for Hawkes, who was nominated for an Oscar just last year for Winter's Bone, but for Olsen this is a huge breakout role. Yes, folks, turns out there's an Olsen sister who's pretty and talented, and then some. Olsen deserves strong consideration for Best Actress, and both she and Hawkes rise far above the script. Their work is so compelling here that it's as if they're on a different planet.\nI wanted very badly to love this movie. I was intrigued by the premise, but ultimately I felt let down. By presenting so much information about Martha's time in the cult, the movie leaves nothing to the imagination, thus removing that promised intrigue. It is a good movie, but it is not a great one, and it would have been an even worse one had it not been for the superhuman efforts of Olsen and Hawkes.\nFor obvious reasons, I won't divulge the ending, but I will say this: it left me completely cold, disillusioned, and perplexed. I don't mind ambiguous endings, but I do mind when a movie ends on an atonal note, meaning that the ending itself doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the movie. What happens to Martha? Why this ending, above all others? It's not a good sign when, after the credits begin to roll and the lights come on, people can be heard asking, \"What?\""}

That's the Muppet formula and has been for four decades. Whether it's Fozzie's goshawful jokes or Kermit and Miss Piggy singing \"Rainbow Connection,\" The Muppets have always known just which heartstrings to pull. This version - reboot? - manages to combine the sweetness of the original movie with the chaos and unfettered hilarity of the TV series. It's well cast, and when it's all over your cheeks will hurt from laughing and your eyes will be damp. Yep, it's one of those.\nAre you over 12? Doesn't matter. Those of us who grew up on Sesame Street know all about Muppets, and they're as beloved by us now as they were in the 1970s. Each character a contrasting individual with eccentricities in full bloom. And all under the control of only a select few operators!\nThe Muppets follows a fairly common theme in movies - something is about to be lost (in this case, the old Muppet Theater in which the original series was filmed), so Something Must Be Done before an evil someone takes over and does bad things. It's not a complex formula, something like A + B + C. Here, the old \"let's put on a show\" trope gets a genuinely funny - and sincere - workout.\nTo begin with, there's a new Muppet, named Walter. In what's one of the funniest unspoken jokes, Walter seemingly has no idea he is a puppet. After all, he has a human brother named Gary (Jason Segal) and seems only mildly perturbed when he himself never grows any taller during the \"early life\" montage. Walter is a huge Muppets fan, and it's not tough to see that one reason this is so is that he sees something of himself in them, even if he has no idea what that is.\nGary, now in his twenties - as is Walter, believe it or not - has a longtime girlfriend named Mary. Gary plans to take Mary to Los Angeles (they live in Smalltown, USA) to celebrate ten years together, and as fate would have it, Walter comes along as well. That's when they discover that the famed Muppet Studios is now a crappy fifty-cent tour full of dust and decaying memories; Walter surreptitiously learns that the land is about to become property of one Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) who tells everyone he plans to build a Muppet museum but who secretly wishes to destroy all of the property so that he can drill for oil. This leads Walter, Gary, and Mary to visit Kermit the Frog and convince him to get the old gang back together so that they can raise enough money to keep the studio.\nIt's a very simple plot, and of course kids aren't going to care about a lack of nuance. In fact, this movie revels in it, mocking such standards as musical and travel montages (in a couple scenes, characters travels by map, a la Indiana Jones). There's no need for a complicated plot. All you need is Muppets and a reason for them to be there.\nThe ingenuity of the very first Muppet movie was in how sweetly it introduced us to characters we already knew. Kermit's travels, picking up Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf, Electric Mayhem, and Miss Piggy, were a wonderful road movie full of puns, laughter, and sincerity. This movie manages to capture quite a bit of that same sentiment. You see, the movie is set in the real world, and the Muppets have been forgotten - in real life, they haven't made a movie since 1999. So the various Muppets have scattered. Fozzie, for example, fronts a faux Muppets act in Reno, Nevada. I am not making that up. Piggy works for Vogue magazine. Gonzo is a plumbing magnate. True story.\nThe movie nails the sentiment, then. It's about many things, and kids will take many lessons from it (subconsciously, of course). One should never give up hope on one's dreams. One should always look for one's own special talent. One should love one's friends and family, overlooking their weaknesses and giving them strength. One should work well with others. In essence, that's what all the Muppet shows and series have been about - working together as a team to accomplish something genuine and beautiful, and this movie really does a terrific job of making every single character's effort seem worthwhile and necessary. \nThis isn't a sappy movie, either. There was actual applause - from kids as well as adults - in the theater in which I saw this film. It never drags, even with musical numbers - and even those music numbers are mocked by the characters themselves (\"didn't we just sing this song?\"). The tone is artfully woven; we laugh, we cry, and we beam because that is how infused with meaning and sincerity these characters truly are. \nAnd oh yes, there are some celebrity cameos, though not really very many. Only one of them, Alan Arkin, actually appeared on the original Muppet Show series, interestingly enough; I kept waiting for Steve Martin or Mel Brooks to show up, but no.\nAnd I'm betting there weren't many dry eyes in the audience when, during the telethon to raise money, Kermit and Miss Piggy duet on \"Rainbow Connection,\" banjo and all. Adults mouthing the words, kids in awe. A real treat."}

It was very existential, especially for sci-fi movies. In the case of the remake, though, existential meant boring - long periods of nothing much going on, little plot development, mysteries best left unsolved because who cares, and so on. In other words, the masterpiece of the original - which I haven't seen - was in its subtlety, quietude, and detail. The American operates in much the same way. It's supposedly a thriller about a veteran hit-man/assassin who, after being ambushed in Sweden, holes up in Italy as he awaits his new assignment. But, like In Bruges before it, things get complicated, and the movie becomes less about what the hit man does and more about why. It's a fascinating, thoughtful look at what's become sort of a tired genre.\nClooney is Jack, an agent for an unnamed organization who's attacked while with a ladyfriend in a remote cabin in Sweden; the tone for the movie is set right from the get-go when, after dispatching his would-be killer, Jack shoots down the girl as well. Better safe than sorry. His handler Pavel (Johan Leysen) has him relocate to a small town in Italy to await further instructions, and soon a new job arises: the creation and assembly of a weapon to be used by a seductive sniper named Mathilde (Thekla Reuten). Meanwhile, Jack finds himself drifting into a relationship with a prostitute, Clara (Violante Placido) and befriending a benevolent priest (Paolo Bonacelli). Might this be Jack's final job?\nHere, Clooney looks more like 1960s George Peppard than the Cary Grant look he's be carrying. Jack doesn't seem conflicted about killing people (and, like a good little agent, tries not to let people get close to him), but his lifestyle appears to be wearing on him. If he had a chance to make a clean break, could he take it? Or is he really destined to live and die with his career choice? Jack is a complex character. We don't know his motivations, because he doesn't know them. We know that he is resourceful and handy, even when he tells the priest that he's no good with machines (e.g., cell phones and pay phones). We know he can fool people effortlessly, that he is cunning and willful. And we can see that when he is trapped in the idyllic town with a beautiful hooker who seems to care a lot about his welfare as well as dealing with a gorgeous killer for whom he is creating this powerful weapon, he is confused and losing control over his own destiny. Until these events, we're led to believe, Jack has drifted from high-paying murder to high-paying murder without worrying about anything other than his survival, and now he has these feelings that there may be something...more. Something beyond the blood.\nAnton Corbijn's film is moody and very well shot; there are sequences during which we feel as if we're behind Jack, seeing the world from his viewpoint, and others where we're mere spectators to his inner torments. We're never let completely into Jack's world, but he lets down his guard just enough for us to peek into his psyche and see how damaged it's become. Clooney, who is marvelous here, does a great job of playing a conflicted cipher, a man who wants out but doesn't want to pay the exit fee. He's such a terrific overall actor that he can wordlessly convey just about any emotion there is; even when close-mouthed and secretive, his eyes tell us he's worried, scared, concerned, or even content.\nThe American is not a brilliant movie by any means, and it'll be a little too slow for some people. Even the action sequences feel like they're walking underwater. That's simultaneously its biggest credit and its biggest debit. It's deliberate, provocative, and entertaining. The ending, too, is well crafted and plausible and packed with emotion."}

In the macro view, it's about a man grieving for his wife, who lies in a coma from which she may never emerge, while simultaneously attempting to care for his two rambunctious daughters, each of whom is nearly alien to the workaholic man. But don't hastily dismiss this as a tearjerker about some guy coming to grips with mortality and/or learning a little something about himself along the way. This is a movie that runs the gamut of emotions, with pristine sincerity, grace, dignity, and rich realism.\nMatt King (George Clooney) is the workaholic, a lawyer who lives in Hawaii. He has a good life - at least until his thrill-seeking wife suffers a serious head injury during a powerboat race, placing her in a deep coma. Matt's orderly life is no more. He must not only deal with the fact that he may never speak with his wife again, he must also learn an entirely new way of life - one with a domestic tinge. As wife Elizabeth's condition deteriorates, Matt must also deal with family and friends and open doors he never knew existed. All right, that's sort of cryptic, so let me give you this tidbit that is in no way a secret in the plot - Elizabeth, Matt shortly discovers, was having an affair at the time of her accident. \nOn top of all of that stress and drama, Matt is the sole trustee of a huge plot of land that has been a part of his family for a very, very long time. He and his cousins have decided to field offers for the land, because the trust becomes dissolved in seven short years. Should they sell to the highest bidder or to a local businessman? Either outcome would leave all of them very rich indeed. The sale of the land will make a huge impact on the island, as it could transform what many see as a beautiful, nearly untouched mark of beauty into a symbol of avarice and decadence.\nThe core of the entire story is Clooney's unbelievably terrific performance; he is vulnerable, strong, confused, decisive, anguished, angry. It's not every actor who can pull off such a wide range of expression, and Clooney is so effective in this movie that you sincerely feel as if you are standing directly in his shoes, seeing all from his perspective rather than just through his eyes. To say that Clooney's Matt is troubled is an understatement, but what makes this performance so remarkable to me is that at no time does he have all of the answers, and at no time does he have no answers at all. He is, to put it another way, us. \nThe tremendous amount of pressure under which Matt finds himself is exacerbated by his daughters' behavior; partly their reaction to their mother's plight but also because, well, they're precocious and self- absorbed, as most kids are when they're teens or preteens. Add in Matt's cluelessness about how to take care of girls; then you have a real recipe for a wacky sitcom, don't you? Only here it's as real as it gets. First there's 10 year old Scotti (newcomer Amara Miller), who acts out in class - including bringing in pictures of her comatose mother for show and tell. Scotti seems like a girl who just hasn't had enough of a male influence in her short life; you get the impression that Mom was the one who took care of the kids while Dad worked and worked. As a result, Scotti is combining typical rebellious behavior with confusion on how she should feel about her mother's being in a coma. Then there's Alexandra, currently away at boarding school; for her, you get the clear impression that she's a real problem child who's used to being shunted from school to school, like a queen of diamonds in a marked-up deck. She's away when the accident occurs; Matt retrieves her (discovering she's as wild as always) and necessarily leans on her to help him deal with his various problems.\nRest assured, there are moments that will jerk tears from you. However, director Alexander Payne does an amazing job of keeping everything level. This isn't a four-hankie movie, because life isn't a four-hankie movie. Life has its terrible moments and its joyous ones, too, and this film emulates that layer of authenticity to really deliver an emotionally powerful, provocative, and endearing story. \nThis isn't a movie you can just grab the kids and some popcorn and be lightly entertained, but it's also not a Think Hard movie. It's somewhere in the middle - again, much like life. Payne and cowriters Nat Faxon and Jim Rash allow us to become psychologically engaged with everything concerning Matt and his family. We're with him so much that when he makes a blunder, we think to ourselves that we'd probably make the same blunder. It's a pleasure to see a movie in which the protagonist clearly doesn't have all of the answers, even to the easy questions, but has some answers to the hard ones. And that's why this is a hard movie to pigeonhole, and it's also why it's such a beautiful, artful film."}

He has no experience in, well, anything \u2013 a true antihero if there ever was one. Is there any doubt that he can pull it off? Did I mention that the professor is played with the usual subtle charm and grim determination of Russell Crowe? No matter who the man plays, he has this quiet intensity such that you expect him to simply exploded with emotion at any moment. But that's part of what makes him a great actor. The same guy who can cry havoc in movies like Robin Hood and Gladiator can dial it down to the point where he's almost whispering his grim determination, like in A Beautiful Mind. It's sort of the same here. Even so, The Next Three Days is not a complete success, and I think it's mainly because it all seems a little too neat and tidy; its implausibility just sinks it.\nJohn (Crowe) and Lara (Elizabeth Banks) are the parents of a young boy. One morning, the police burst in and arrest Lara on the spot for the murder of her boss, with whom she'd had an argument the day before. Next thing we all know, a guilty verdict is rendered, and Lara is sentenced to a long stretch in the pen.\nWe are expected to believe that Lara is innocent. But during the first hour or so of the movie, the focus shifts \u2013 it's not about what happened the night of the murder, it's what's going to happen, such as how John will react. What's his plan? What's his angle? Does he, in fact, believe in his wife's innocence?\nFrom that point on, we're treated to a virtual montage of Planning. Often in movies like this, the protagonist will gather a bunch of friends and acquaintances and assign each a task \u2013 distract the guard, cut the concertina wire, flash bomb in the cafeteria, and so on \u2013 and then things go wrong. Disguises are involved in the subterfuge as well. But not this time. This is John's game. He does enlist the advice of a career criminal who's escaped from prison several times (Liam Neeson, in a very, very small role), but for the most part John uses his community- school-teaching skills to figure stuff out. Oh, and the Internet, which teaches him about how to make a \"bump key\" and other fun facts.\nThe characters are believable, even if the plot sometimes is not. Although Lara is in prison for a long time, it's tough to tell how much time passes before John can implement his daring plan. Months? Years? He doesn't seem to age a bit \u2013 and neither does his young son, for that matter. So if it's a matter of months, he sure learns a lot in a short amount of time. Kind of gives you the impression that if you study something really hard over a short time frame, you'll grasp all of the intricacies and be prepared to address previously unforeseen problems. Uh huh.\nCrowe himself is engaging as always, so if you're a fan there's no reason not to watch this. Banks \u2013 whose hair changes from bright blonde to dark black in prison in a blink of an eye, and I'm still not sure why \u2013 is good but could have been replaced by any number of actresses, like Naomi Watts or Tea Leoni or Maria Bello. She's window dressing, there to provide a counterbalance to that ever-present grim determination of Crowe's John Brennan.\nSo it's all about Russell Crowe Doing the Right Thing, and even halfway through the movie you get a strong sense of how it'll all end up. He's the hero, the system is the bad guy, and that's about it. There are some decent action scenes, as well as some fine detective work, but little to really separate the movie from other break-'em-out flicks."}

That's a fact. The setup and premise are familiar, even if the characters are not. So as such, I can understand someone's not liking this one much at all. But. I personally found the first and second ones to be pretty scary \u2013 even when, in the second one, I knew stuff was going to happen. It has to be a good film when you're surprised even when you expect something, right? So, right or wrong, I loved this movie. It gave me what I was seeking, and more.\nWhereas the second film was set shortly before the first one, this film takes a look at the childhood of Katie, the protagonist of the first film. You may recall that as the first movie progressed, Katie became convinced that something was after her specifically \u2013 but she couldn't imagine why. This movie attempts to resolve that issue. And you sort of have to give credit to a movie that resolves some things while leaving other threads dangling just enough to make one wonder what the hey is going on.\nIt's 1988. Young Katie lives with her younger sister Kristi, her mom Julie, and Julie's boyfriend Dennis. Strange things are afoot in their house, around the same time that young Kristi begins communicating with an imaginary friend named Toby. Is it a normal kid phase, or is it something more sinister? As with the other films, cameras are placed around the house to capture anything odd that may happen during the night. (In a clever bit of ingenuity, Dennis takes apart an oscillating fan and places a camera on it so that he can pan from living room to kitchen and back.)\nWhat makes a movie like this work for me is the same thing that made The Blair Witch Project work (and its sequel not work at all) \u2013 it feels voyeuristic, as if we were simply peeking in on some family's everyday lives. Reasons are given for the constant filming (Dennis tells Kristi, for example, that he's \"testing\" his new camera as they have a tea party.) We're automatically drawn to the video footage. What will we see? We're now ready for something \u2013 will it jump out at us? Will furniture be overturned? Or something even worse?\nThe mood is another huge selling point. People react as you'd expect them to. Dennis is obsessed with finding out what's causing those noises and other disturbances; Julie thinks he's completely off his rocker and becomes more testy as time goes by. People who also experience the occurrences, like a babysitter and a friend of Dennis, are stunned to the point of not wishing to discuss the matter further, hurriedly leaving as soon as possible.\nNow, I can't say that everyone, even those who love to be scared, is going to love this as much as I did. For me, since we see almost everything through the lens of a camera, the terror \u2013 and the anticipation \u2013 are grossly heightened. When that door is opened, what will we find? It's not going to be pretty, but unlike a standard horror film where one can simply slough off a shock as being too fantastic, here we're so easily drawn in by and engaged with our surrogate family that we feel as terrified and mystified as they do.\nParanormal Activity 3 won't answer everything that the first two may have left unsolved, but it does offer hints as to why, in the present day, these events are still occurring to Katie and her family. We see a part of that genesis, and it's not really what I expected. I was unsettled and thankful I hadn't seen the movie at night. Okay, that might be a little hyperbolic, and when some of you actually watch the movie you'll laugh at me for being skittish. I don't care. I enjoyed the movie, and that's all I'm concerned with."}

It is a political melodrama, but it just as easily have been written about business and high finance. It's highly cynical, with its points driven home by a terrific cast, and yet it manages not to be heavy handed or preachy. Indeed, there aren't really any strictly good or bad guys in this movie.\nRyan Gosling stars as Steven Myers, a top aide to Governor Mike Morris (George Clooney), who is running for president; currently at stake is the battleground state of Ohio. If Morris can gain Ohio's delegates, he's pretty much assured to get the Democratic nomination, and in the film it's noted that the Republicans have a weak field themselves (at best). All of this means, of course, that as Ohio goes, so goes the presidency, so there's plenty riding on this one primary.\nMorris' campaign manager is Paul Zara, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, a veteran of many cutthroat campaigns. And although Zara has the experience, Morris often turns to his young(ish) aide Steven to gain a less-jaded, more-truthful perspective. (Of course, by doing so, Morris is simply trying to hear from someone who may not be thinking four years or fewer down the road at his next job.) Like most staffers, Steven believes in Morris; he thinks that if the man is elected president, good things will happen. He is the prototypical idealistic aide; doing the right thing will win out over all, he believes. He's not completely naive to backdoor politics, but his organization, his analysis, his acumen, and his spirit are what endear Morris to him.\nEven though Steven is not a Mr. Perfect, a self-righteous do-gooder, he's savvy; he knows which buttons to push. He learns, though, that his chief obstacle to success is in recognizing whom is trustworthy, and just because one is friends with another doesn't mean that either owes the other much when it comes to the game of politics. For example, simply feeding the press (in the person of Marisa Tomei) the occasional tidbit doesn't mean that the media will be an extended PR arm for Morris.\nSomewhere along the line, Steven reaches a breaking point, a place at which loyalty isn't the most important thing on his plate. This point comes as a result of two pretty bad decisions, one that he knows is a bad idea right away and another that seems a little more innocent \u2013 but then Steven has underestimated how petty, parochial, and vindictive those in the business can be. It's all about one's level of paranoia. You have to have some in order to foresee problems, but too much of it will hollow out your soul in a jiffy.\nClooney, who also directed, looks and sounds presidential, but he's not the focus of the movie; as with his brilliant Good Night, and Good Luck, he's a powerful supporting character. Things don't revolve around Mike Morris as they do around Steven Myers, and that's one reason the movie works \u2013 our focus is on the morality battle, and it's presumed that as a sitting governor, that battle's long been over for Morris.\nThe hand-picked cast is superb. Not only do we get Clooney, Hoffman, Tomei, and Gosling, we also get Paul Giamatti as the governor's opponent's campaign manager. Each one seems to steal scenes, even ones they share. Even Evan Rachel Wood, as a new intern in Morris' camp, turns in a splendid performance.\nIt's clear that The Ides of March won't be for everyone. It is, as I said, cynical \u2013 highly so. It won't leave you hopeful about, well, anything. It gives you no one for whom to really cheer and yet no one for whom to really despise. It offers realism in lieu of hope, and its goal of trying to explain the motivations of those who get involved in these campaigns is reached. It's an effective, gripping melodrama."}

Gone are the clever, juvenile jokes, gone are the ubiquitous culture references. Red State is the best kind of horror thriller - the kind that has a message but doesn't beat you about the head with it. It's terrifying at turns, and its unpredictability is its strongest virtue.\nTo compare Red State with Smith's earlier works would be terribly unfair. To be sure, the movie does begin with a Smith-like ode to horny teenage boys everywhere, but that carefree, Dazed-and-Confused attitude is quickly dismissed, and we're quickly introduced to horror that could have been directed by any number of legends - Friedkin, Spielberg, Craven, Hooper, et al.\nThree boys find an ad on Craig's List from a \"lonely housewife\" who's looking for a little action from more than one participant. The lads dash off, sideswiping a car in the process, and come across the woman's home - a beat-up trailer. She invites them in, and after some teasing and some imbibing, the boys wake up to find themselves in an unusual place: a church run by an ultra-fundamentalist cult. And things don't look good.\nThe church is loosely based on the Westboro Baptist Church, run by Fred Phelps and his family. I say \"loosely,\" but that's really for legal purposes as far as Smith is concerned; this is definitely supposed to be the WBC gang. You know them - they're the ones who protest the funerals of dead soldiers and have a real problem with homosexuals.\nThings snowball in a hurry, although I won't get into any of them here. It's safe to say that nothing turns out the way any one person planned it to. There is shooting, some torturing, and so on. But the blood is sparse; the film is not gory. It's like Smith toned it down as if to say \"Hey, this isn't just some slasher pic.\" It surely isn't.\nMichael Parks steals the movie - and really should get some individual recognition - as the patriarchal head of the church. He's whip-smart, cunning, deadly, sinister, charming, and (for good or ill) faithful. John Goodman plays an ATF agent who's stuck between trying to cut down all of the cultists (per orders) or saving at least the children. He's damned either way, pardon the pun.\nAlthough this is not a movie for the kids, please don't hastily dismiss this as a shoot-em-up or a bloodbath. It's true that characters aplenty meet their demise, but the overall theme of maintaining one's faith with the right intentions (say New Testament rather than Old), of doing the right thing, remains intact. The mood of Smith's departure movie is dark and daring, but it's never over the top. There is no gratuitous violence, and no sex at all. What makes it so fear-inducing is that it can be real; it's a plausible bit of terror."}

It's a gigantic treat to lovers of literature everywhere, but even if you don't know Toulouse-Lautrec from 2Pac, you should truly love either the tantalizing romantic angles or the mystery/fantasy underlying them all.\nAllen is getting too old to be playing himself in these movies, so the task falls to Owen Wilson (who doesn't have to change anything to do an Allen impression). Wilson plays Gil, a Hollywood writer engaged to Inez (Rachel McAdams), and they're tagging along with Inez's parents on their vacation to Paris. But while Inez is enamored with pretty, shiny objects and appearances, Gil instantly falls in love with the soul of Paris and wants nothing more than to wander its streets, particularly at night, to soak in its ambiance and perhaps get inspired to work on his burgeoning first novel. After all, such literary greats as Hemingway, Eliot, Fitzgerald, and Stein roamed those very streets; perhaps what they saw will help Gil.\nNow, the following is not a spoiler in least. A quick look at the list of characters should indicate a change in venue for Gil. One evening, a little drunk from a wine tasting, Gil sits on a church's steps; as the clock chimes midnight, an old car pulls up, exhorting him to come with them. Where? Why to the Fitzgeralds' of course. This leads Gil down quite the path of self-examination and inspiration.\nAlong the way, Gil meets many of his literary heroes and discovers a little bit about what makes them tick. He's even able to make return visits by going to the same place at the same time. Of course, Inez doesn't believe him and is increasingly concerned with buying antique furniture with her bossy, snobby mother. The chasm between man and almost-wife widens.\nThere are several reasons to recommend this movie. As usual, Allen's handpicked cast is up to its tasks. Some of these actors are known quantities to many people, but some are not; either way, they imbue their own characters with such a sense of reality that it's easy to imagine that actor truly is that icon. They deal not in caricatures but in realizations.\nAnother huge plus is the way that the storyline is set up. On the one hand, you have the conflict between Inez and Gil, and on another you have his cathartic moments with his literary heroes. Along the way, Gil meets the Portugese Adriana (Marion Cotillard), a beauty who has inspired famous painters and who is in love with an earlier time \u2013 just as Gil is infatuated with his own earlier time. The moral that ties these two worlds and their inhabitants together is a simple one, and Allen delivers it with subtle grace and beauty.\nI have never been to Paris, a faraway land to me. But look at what Allen has done with the way the movie is shot. Paris is idyllic in the daytime, a combination of markets and boutiques, air-conditioned restaurants and street caf\u00e9s. At night, the city comes alive, even in the rain; the movie is shot with such unerring detail and each raindrop seems a work of art symbolizing Gil's various quandaries.\nI think that Midnight in Paris is one of Allen's finest over the past 20 years, perhaps one of his best ever, and certainly I'm not saying so idly. The man has a long track record of delightful, funny comedies and romances. He knows his audience well. But here, I think he surpassed some expectations; his recent spate of Euro-centric movies (like Vicky Cristina Barcelona and Match Point) were fairly well received by most critics (ahem, not this one), but Midnight in Paris far exceeds them both \u2013 as well as just about anything Allen's done going back to the mid-1990s. It is a superlative film that's rich in texture, meaning, and elegance, and its ending is a little surprising but certainly plausible \u2013 the perfect ending."}

It's as if someone ripped off And Then There Were None but forgot to provide suspense.\nThe plot: a schizophrenic mass murderer kills his wife and lays dying, vowing to kill all children born in the town on that day. And then he dies. And then every year for 16 years, the Riverton Seven (!) have a mock holiday in which they hold a jolly candlelight vigil around the burned-out remains of the ambulance in which the Ripper presumably perished, and then someone dresses up as the Ripper himself, scaring everyone, to great amusement.\nOnly this time, in Year 16, young Bug (Max Thierot) \u2013 chosen to \"fight\" the mock Ripper \u2013 is too frightened to participate, and so the evil demon, at least in the framework of the carnival-like atmosphere, isn't vanquished. What's this mean? Why, obviously that the Riverton Seven will be killed in gruesome \u2013 but unique \u2013 ways before the day is out.\nThere are many problems with this story, but to discuss some of them would be to give away plot elements. Let's start with the obvious. After Bug (who's always referred to as \"angelic\" or \"virginal\" and so on) doesn't fight off the not-demon, everyone assumes that means death for the Seven. I mean, it's not even a logical question for them. No one seems to say, \"Hey, wait, demons aren't real\" or \"Hey, wait, a soul can't possess a normal human being.\" So right off the bat, because the townspeople buy into this malarkey without blinking an eye, so too are we expected to. Okay, fine.\nA second problem is that it's patently obvious pretty early on what the first twist is going to be. Bug is raised by his single mom, and he has an evil sister named Fang (okay, Leah), who rules the high school. Where's dad at? We'll probably find out. Yes, the town of Riverton holds some scary, shadowy secrets that we won't find out until the final reel, but by then they won't really be secrets.\nMuch of the fighting between the Ripper and his prey takes places in the dark, which makes it even easier to suspend disbelief. Plus, when everything's explained at the end \u2013 and rest assured, it will be \u2013 any explanation can do when the past 20 minutes have been dimly lit.\nThe movie ends in such a straightforward, innocuous manner that you almost think Craven was forced into making it so. Surely a master of the genre wouldn't use a generic ending that doesn't even have a twist. It's as close to a happily ever after ending you'll get in a horror film. Compounding the mistake is that there were at least two alternate endings I thought of that would have been far, far better, each hinting at a more sinister meaning to everything. But no, we're stuck with crap instead. For much of the movie, it feels like we're stuck in it as well.\nHere's your one bright spot: the acting. The kids are pretty impressive, all things considered. They're believable, even when they're stereotyped, Breakfast Club-style, as the odd nerd, the Jesus freak, the dumb jock, the popular blonde, and the gothy girl who runs things. The young cast rises a little above their one dimensionality to at least give you something positive to take away from what's otherwise a pretty low-grade, straight-line pseudothriller."}

Guy gets wrongly convicted (maybe) for a grisly murder; outside folks try everything to get him out. The twist in this case is that his working-class sister, a bartender, gets a law degree to help prove his innocence.\nIf it weren't for the cast, you'd never have heard of this movie. Chances are fairly good, really, that you haven't heard of it anyway. Two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank plays Betty Anne Waters, a working single mother does all she can to ensure her brother's release from prison. Brother Kenny (Sam Rockwell) is doing life for a horrifying murder of an older lady. His trial is swift. Betty's devotion to her brother - shown tautly in flashbacks - is stronger than even her bond with her family, as the fight to prove his innocence takes precedence over almost everything.\nProblem number one is that Kenny's trial doesn't seem wrongheaded or one-sided in the least, certainly not to the average viewer. Is he innocent? Don't know. Did he not receive a fair trial? Looked fair from here. So we need to take it on faith that Betty Anne's conviction (ha!) of her brother's non-guilt isn't unfounded. She's aided by the only other \"older student\" in her law class, played with knowing grace by Minnie Driver, and later on by the famous Barry Scheck, founder of The Innocence Project. Together, this legal trio must fight corruption, red tape, and ennui on the part of everyone else.\nProblem number two is that the whole thing is just a manic-depressive's dream. One moment Betty Anne is gloriously happy! She did something right! Woo! And then moments later she's a sad panda, because some obstacle, unforeseen by her but totally predictable by the rest of us, pops up. But then all is awesome again! And on and on and on it goes, and where it stops we just plain don't care.\nThe background of the relationship of Betty Anne and Kenny makes things worse, not better; if it were meant to clarify, anyway. We see Kenny the thuggish bully, although he stands up for little sis. We see them both as products of a broken home, eventually sent to separate foster homes. But so what? All we see of Kenny lends credence to the theory/fact that he's a violent, violent man.\nThe ending is a foregone conclusion, but I'll be helpful and not mention what exactly it is. The trouble is that it's not only foregone, it's sort of a letdown. There are no loose ends, and there are no actual twists. A leads to B leads to C. Despite the best efforts of the cast, Convicted isn't worth anyone's time. Swank, possibly cognizant of a one-dimensional plot, overacts, and when she looks mad or gloomy she looks exactly like Matt Damon, which isn't flattering when you're supposed to be Hilary Swank."}

But it's because of that supposed stunt casting that Megamind works, at least to some degree. Will Ferrell and Tina Fey, along with Brad Pitt, own their roles and imbue them with purpose and personality. The animation itself is standard, and the story is simply steady, but everyone involved appears to be having a blast.\nMegamind (Ferrell) is an evil mastermind whose plotting never pans out. He lives in Metro City (which he amusingly pronounces \"Metr-ocity,\" rhyming with \"atrocity\"), which is defended by the saint-like Metroman (Pitt). Both hero and villain came to Earth from faraway planets but diverging destinies, and they've been fighting each other almost since their arrival. But every battle ends the same \u2013 Megamind is captured and jailed, and later he escapes and begins the feud anew. Until, that is, the day when he finally does defeat Metroman and thus loses his purpose in life. I'm sure we can all sort of relate to that.\nOther characters include a chirpy reporter named Roxanne Ritchie (Tina Fey), who's close to Metroman, and Hal Stewart (Jonah Hill), a cameraman who wants to be close to Roxanne. They make unlikely allies and adversaries, and not always with each other. They are also played to opposite degrees of success; Fey is as likable and adorable as always, but Hill is just flat as the doting cameraman. You'd think that would be right up his alley, but a change in character midway through doesn't feel sincere, and it's mostly because Hill himself lacks the poise and panache to pull it off effectively.\nFey and Ferrell work very well together here, which shouldn't be too surprising. They're both comic talents, and they know their timing well. But there's this, too: there's a fine line between being funny and being hammy, and it's easy to jump over that line for most comic actors. Give them too much rope, they chew the scenery with it, to mix two completely unrelated metaphors. Each actor has a lot of fun with his or her character (it wouldn't surprise me if there had been some improv involved) without running amok with it. That helps the so-so script and plot devices. Also helping: David Cross as a fish-like alien who came to Earth with Megamind and has been his loyal sidekick ever since. He's named Minion for some reason. (Yes, I am kidding.)"}

Scarier, right amount of cheese and camp, terrific, dead-on acting. Excellent thriller, especially (as much as I hate to admit it) in 3D.\nAnton Yelchin (Star Trek) is Charlie Brewster, a high schooler who lives in a town outside of Las Vegas with his single mom, played by Toni Collette. Charlie has a gorgeous girlfriend (Imogen Poots) and cool-kid friends. One of his older friends, Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse of Superbad and Kick-Ass) comes to him and asks for Charlie's help; it seems that a third friend has gone missing, and Ed believes vampires are to blame. Specifically, he feels that Charlie's new next-door neighbor Jerry (Colin Farrell) is the chief vampire and is literally sucking the town dry.\nI was fortunate enough to watch this as a sneak preview, because I don't think I would have splurged for the 3D version. But it's totally worth it. The film will be subtly 3D for most of the time, and then all of a sudden something will unexpectedly - but plausibly - come flying at you. Love it. Well done, well executed, very detailed use of the technology, for a change.\nCharlie necessarily turns to a TV vampire (think of a Criss Angel knockoff) who's rehearsing for his Vegas show. In the original, the role was that of a late-night horror-movie TV host, played by Roddy McDowell, but here he's played with almost demented glee by David Tennant (Dr. Who). What good is a fake vampire hunter against a real vampire? A little good, as it turns out.\nThe movie's exciting. It's funny without straining for laughs; it's scary without forcing fear. It doesn't get mired in overexposition: Farrell's vampire is just there, no explanation needed; tropes of vampire lore are mentioned, but no background material is needed. Its simplicity is its greatest asset.\nThe cast as a whole is strong, particularly Farrell, who plays creepy and diabolical better than I thought possible. He's always been able to be violent, but this role brought a different level of acting out of him. Well played.\nSuffice to say that if you don't like vampire movies, there's no reason in the world for you to watch this. So don't. You'll just get mad, and there's no need for that.

It succeeds because it declares what it wants to be right from the start and doesn't stray from its main goal, to hearken back to those low-budget exploitation films of the 1970s.\nYou probably know that the movie's genesis was the Grindhouse duo of movies directed by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez; fake trailers separated the two showings. The trailers were so successful that plans were launched to make full-length movies of them, and Hobo with a Shotgun is the second, following Rodriguez's own Machete.\nThe title is self explanatory, and the plot is simple. A nameless hobo, played with grit and glee by Rutger Hauer, arrives in a new town, anxious to start a new life for himself. But it's a town run by a merciless boss and his Ray-Ban-wearing sons; crime isn't just in fashion, it's the law. There's a child-molesting Santa Claus. Every cop is corrupt. It's like walking through Detroit at night. I kid, I've never had to do that. But it's bad.\nAnd soon our antihero is embroiled in do-gooding on the behalf of a put-upon prostitute (Molly Dunsworth), saving her from the inevitable rape by one of the sons. And then he gets his hand on the titular gun, and there's nary a scene that's not absolutely soaked in crimson from thence on.\nLook, don't look for logic and realism here. It's not supposed to be real, it's supposed to be visceral violence. It's supposed to gross you out. There are decapitations. There are children murdered in cold blood. There are ice skates to the back. There are large, knight-like warriors \u2013 a pair known as The Plague \u2013 who look like a cross between Monty Python's The Black Knight and a barbecue grill. There are entrails and sundry organs. It is not a movie for kids, is what I'm getting at here. Heck, it's not even rated.\nSo, obviously, most people out there aren't going to like this movie, full stop. It's not only not everyone's cup of tea, it's really the cup of tea of only a small percentage of us. But those who do like this will really get into it.

It has the music, it has the charm, and it has the helpful nonhuman acting as the protagonist's conscience. It's also gorgeously animated, with a simple plot that hearkens back to the studio's golden age while maintaining the ability to capture the imagination and attention of today's kids (and adults).\nTrue fact: this movie was originally supposed to be called \"Rapunzel,\" but execs at Disney figured that wouldn't appeal much to little boys (they'd made a mistake, the thinking went, with an earlier feature, The Princess and the Frog). Thus the title change.\nSo you know the story of Rapunzel, right? Cute lass, trapped up in a tower, had long hair, etc.? Same basic idea here, only Rapunzel is secretly - not a spoiler - the lost princess of the kingdom, spirited away as an infant by an evil crone; seems Rapunzel's hair is not only long but magical as all get out, and the old crone has been able to use the hair - and the girl's song - to retain her youth.\nEvery year on the princess's birthday, the still-mourning kingdom releases hundreds of lanterns into the sky, hoping that somehow their lost child will find her way home. And every year, Rapunzel sees these lanterns and wonders about their source - could they have anything to do with her, since they appear only on her birthday? Enter Flynn Rider (har har), a thief on the run from that very same kingdom for, you know, thieving. Anyway, he runs into Rapunzel, and they make a pact - he takes her to see where the lanterns come from, and she'll return to him the crown that he had just stolen from aforementioned kingdom but she took from him after whacking him on the head with a frying pan. You know, standard Disney fairy-tale stuff.\nFor the most part, the movie is just plain funny. It's about dreams and hopes and how you shouldn't let go of either, even in the face of defeat. And that's a great message, sure. But it helps that Rapunzel and Flynn are aptly cast (respectively, the known Mandy Moore and the unknown Zachery Levi) and that each isn't just a caricature. There's a lot of whimsy to go along with the derring-do, a word that's just not used enough nowadays. (Derring-do, not whimsy.) And yes, it has plenty of heart. It has all the hallmarks of a Disney movie without the debit of latter-day stunt casting. It focuses itself on Rapunzel and Flynn working together to allow the former to realize her dream. Because there are not distinctly comical figures in the movie, the humor simply evolves; it's not forced or distracting. Side note, though - one of the best characters in the film is Maximus the horse; he's at odds with Flynn (trying to capture him, as a horse of the palace) and likes Rapunzel, and he has more personality and expressiveness than most of the humans."}

In fact, it's gloriously scary in ways that the 1984 original simply can't match. It's unmarred by cheesy special effects and delves a little more into the psychology of Freddy Krueger, and as a result it delivers a stronger punch than you'd expect from rehashed horror.\nFor those who don't know, here's your story: many moons ago, a man named Freddy Krueger was burned alive by angry parents; now he haunts those parents' kids in their own dreams, and when he kills in their dreams, they die in real life. You can die in your dreams, you know. Just ask Mario Mario.\nThe original Nightmare on Elm Street was mostly about high school kids dying in increasingly gruesome ways, which is where we are today with a lot of horror \u2013 Saw, Hostel, House of Wax, and so on. The new one still shows plenty of gratuitous and creative violence, but Freddy is even more diabolical and menacing, less of a sideshow freak and more of a terrifying monster. This is in part due to Jackie Earle Haley, who seems very much a living, breathing demon, every raspy syllable. Haley, so great in Watchmen, Little Children, and even unwatchable dreck like All the King's Men, has turned out to be one hell of a good actor, and I hope that one of these days he gets some real recognition as such.\nThe plot is basically the same as that of the original. If the kids fall asleep, they encounter Freddy, who kills them. So some of them try not to fall asleep (missing, for the most part, is the ghostly nursery rhyme about Mr. Krueger), either by popping pills or just drinking way too much coffee.\nThe protagonist is played by Rooney Mara, sister to Kate Mara and great-granddaughter to New York Giants owner Tim Mara. She's a hell of a lot more believable than any of the other \"good guys,\" which is fine. If anyone in a horror movie should be plausible, it should be the main character. The others can be fodder if they want.\nThe mood is appropriately dark, almost trembling as it backlights the scenes. And although there's plenty of spilled blood to go around, it feels almost more like a psychological thriller and less of a gorefest, and I think that shows some bit of maturity in the genre. Who's to say? Maybe these old franchises will get rebooted intelligently. It could happen."}

There is plenty to like about the movie, but if you are looking for much resembling the legend as we all know it, you might be disappointed. The Disney version had more in common with the tale of Robin Hood than this Ridley Scott version.\nRussell Crowe is Robin Hood, although I don't think he's ever referred to as such. Cate Blanchett is Lady Marion - no, not Maid, Lady. Right. And the Sheriff of Nottingham, although not a good guy, is barely in the movie. And much of the movie has more to do with the invading French army than Robin Hood robbing the rich to feed the poor, so it's essentially a war movie, not a swashbuckling romance. Errol Flynn might wonder why there's less derring-do and more gritty realism.\nCrowe is Robin Longstride, a soldier in King Richard's Crusades. As the army is returning from its latest Crusade, Richard is killed, thus making his younger brother John, played with efficient malevolence by Oscar Isaac, the new king of England. Robin heads back to England separately with some of his not-yet-merry men and stumbles across a group of knights carrying Richard's crown and stallion, heading to a boat to take them to England. All the knights are slain in an ambush, but with a dying breath one hands Robin his sword and begs him to return it to his home in England and give it to his estranged father.\nThe man was named Loxley - sound familiar? - and his father is now an old blind man (Crusades took a long time back then). Robin returns the sword to the man and meets Loxley's widow, Lady Marion Loxley. But the elder Loxley (Max von Sydow) has a plan - he wants Robin to pretend to be his prodigal son, thus giving hope to the impoverished village. And then it gets complicated.\nA lot of exposition, and we're not even at the battle scenes! Let's just say that John and his henchman Godfrey (Mark Strong) want Robin out of the way, as he \"knows too much.\" Meanwhile, the French are plotting to invade and are under the impression that England's on the verge of civil war, what with various barons trying to get the king to sign the Magna Carta and all. It should be noted that there are numerous anachronisms in the movie, so it really shouldn't be viewed as a history lesson.\nBoth Crowe and Blanchett are terrific, as always. Their performances help one forget Kevin Costner and Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio, thank goodness. Each brings a lot of passion to their roles. Blanchett can pull off the difficult feat of looking good - not gorgeous, not sexy - and tough at the same time. Her Marion is ballsy, almost Irish in disposition.\nScott's direction helps a bit as well, particularly in the climactic battle scene (which looks too much like the Normandy invasion in WW II, really). Unlike some action movies, where the movements are so quick you cannot tell who is decapitating whom, everything feels clear, focused, and logical.\nThe only problem I have with this movie is that it seems to be trying to cram too much plot into itself. Although one can tell the combatants apart in a fight scene, it's often tough to know who is on which side. Who is traitorous to whom, anyway? There seem to be too many plot threads; I would have liked to known more about von Sydow's Walter Loxley and less about, well, the lesser battles that are fought. Scott is an excellent director, but he throws too much action without balancing it with some more honest-to-goodness exposition and motivation. He needn't spend a lot of time on the Marion-Robin romance, either; as it was, it seemed to evolve organically anyway.\nEven so, the movie feels like it's lacking something, perhaps a real heart, despite the stars' efforts. Crowe is the oldest Robin Hood ever, but you wouldn't know it from his performance here, and Blanchett is definitely no pushover as Marion. But it felt as if I should have been more drawn into their relationship; the lack of emotional investment is the only thing that really hurts this film."}

The eighth and final Harry Potter movie is perhaps the best of the entire lot, as it seamlessly mixes fantastic action with intricate exposition. It satisfactorily completes the story, tying up all essential loose ends, and leaves you with a sense of acceptable finality. It's a textbook example of how to finish a film series.\nHP 7a begins right where the HP 7a left off, a departure from the other films (which dove almost right into a major action scene). I liked that, because even though the final book was split into two movies, for the sake of continuity it's best to think of them as one long, long movie. This continuity allowed us to remain in sync with the characters and their plight, rather than removing us from the action.\nHarry is still on the lookout for the remaining Horcruxes, objects into which Voldemort has placed portions of his soul. He, along with Ron and Hermione, have left Hogwarts, which is now under the ruthless rule of one Professor Snape, who may or may not have had something to do with the death of the last headmaster (Dumbledore). Snape may or may not be working for the Dark Lord; it's something that's been ambiguous for many movies now. Meanwhile, Voldemort is assembling his forces and, knowing the prophecy that says only he or Harry may live, seeks his enemy's demise.\nThere are two major, long scenes in the movie: one involves a break in (and break out) of the goblin bank Gringotts, and the other is the epic Battle of Hogwarts. Both seem terrifyingly real, especially when viewed in IMAX 3D. I don't often go for the IMAX experience, or for 3D, but this was a good choice. Director Peter Yates made great use of the technology.\nI think the movie is fairly true to the book, with only some minor changes. For example, the character of Crabbe, one of Draco Malfoy's buddies, doesn't appear in the movie - because the actor who played him had had a drug conviction, thus necessitating a script change. But for the most part, things are as they were in the book.\nThe most touching moments are the quiet, sometimes unexpected ones. There are many times during the movie when characters feel that they could die at any moment, so they say and do things believing there may not be time later on. The terrific cast - especially the younger actors - is compelling as always, believable not only as witches and wizard but as loving, feeling human being just like us.\nOf course, the biggest emotional moment takes place in the Forbidden Forest, an ethereal scene that brings back a lot of memories for Harry; it's somewhat reminiscent of the cave scene on Dagobah in The Empire Strikes Back, except that in this case the scene propels the plot and serves as an emotional counter to all the battling going on around it.\nThere are no major flaws in this movie, and the minor ones are inconsequential. The film maintains its sense of urgency, seriousness, and dark attitude; you genuinely feel as if the fate of the world rests on this manchild with a lightning scar. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II is a beautiful, elegant coda to a long-running series that began as a kids' movie and became more mature as it progressed, much like its youthful main cast."}

Cars 2, like the Toy Story films, captures every bit of sincerity, thrills, and pitch-perfect animation that the original did. It's a beautifully shot movie with terrific voice characterizations, including a surprisingly awesome turn by Larry the Cable Guy.\nIn the movie, Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) has settled down in Radiator Springs with his girlfriend Sally Carerra (Bonnie Hunt) when he is goaded into joining a three-country race by an Italian Formula One car voiced by John Turturro (who's hilarious). Naturally, Lightning must take along his bestest best friend, Tow Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), who's - shall we say - not as world wise as McQueen or the rest of his crew. Hilarity ensues.\nTo add to the tension, all of the racers are required to use a new alternative fuel invented by eco-awesome-dude Sir Miles Axelrod (Eddie Izzard), but when a few cars mysteriously explode during the first leg of the race, in Tokyo, people start to wonder if the fuel is indeed safe. Of course it is - because the real culprit - as we learn right away! - is employing electromagnetic pulses to disable the vehicles in the hopes that people will blame the fuel, which will bring them back to good ol' yummy oil. But tipped off to this subterfuge is British agent Finn McMissle (Michael Caine) who, along with his new-to-the-field sidekick Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer), is out to stop whoever's behind all of this - and that, my friends, is where Mater comes in.\nThis isn't really a Lightning McQueen movie; he's more of a supporting character, as Mater is unwittingly pulled into the espionage business by the Brits, who mistake him for a fellow agent (those English are so gullible!). But because of Mater's inelegance and lack of focus, McQueen winds up losing that first race, a result for which he blames a crestfallen Mater. There's your friendship conflict, always a reliable trope in animation.\nThe race then shifts to Milan and then London, with Tuturro's Bernoulli and Wilson's McQueen trading many a barb and insult (with Bernoulli usually winning). This allows the animators to mix in some awesome scenery from both countries, and you'll swear it's filmed rather than animated. Absolutely spell binding.\nThe two plots, the spy angle and the brotherly friendship deal, dovetail nicely by movie's end, but not before we're honestly treated to some spectacular stunt driving (ahem) - off roofs, down parking garages, and so on. It's like parkour for cars, which most of us would call driving but the cars here probably call walking and climbing.\nI saw this movie not only in 3D but also in IMAX. I've said harsh things about 3D, and IMAX costs even more per movie. It's all worth it here.

For some reason, I was picturing a raucous, raunchy comedy about a legal brothel run by Joe Pesci and Helen Mirren. But it's not really that way at all; no, this is a standard-issue melodrama about an abusive misogynist who runs his part of the world, his steely wife who runs the business side of the things, and the hapless pro boxer who gets mixed up with them. It's not funny because it's not supposed to be, and that's kind of sad; there's potential for laughs, but in the end all you get are clich\u00e9s and bad character choices.\nCharlie (Pesci) and Grace (Mirren) Bontempo open up the first legal brothel in Nevada. She's the daughter of a prostitute, he's done a stretch in San Quentin. It's the 1970s. They have a pretty good setup for themselves; good-looking women, steady clients, and the law on their side (and in their pockets). They don't want for much, seemingly. Then Charlie, a hotheaded tempest in a teacup if ever there was one, gets the idea that they'll garner more respect (or, more accurately, he will) if they own a successful professional boxer. So he buys the contract of one Armando Bruza, an up-and-coming Argentinian, much to Grace's chagrin. Charlie's banking on his guy doing well in his next fight, based on the rumor that Muhammed Ali would take on the winner.\nHere, Pesci plays a slightly watered-down version of Tommy DeVito from Goodfellas. He's foul mouthed, ill tempered, not very bright about a great many things, and seems to survive on chutzpah and the good grace of, well, Grace. Naturally, being the proprietor of a brothel has its privileges, and Charlie samples the wares with some regularity, an occurrence that Grace idly tolerates. When she's asked to become Bruza's manager - as a felon, Charlie can't get a license - she's reluctant, but the swarthy boxer has other ideas. And so it goes.\nNow, there's nothing inherently wrong with predictability. If I expect A to happen, and A happens, that's okay - as long as A wasn't spelled out as a fait accompli. If I expect A to happen, but B happens, that is also okay - as long as B is plausible. Here, I expect A to happen, and A happens, and it's obvious from almost the start of the movie that A will happen. This extends to character development as well. If a character does something, say, out of character (!), that's fine - as long as it propels the plot AND makes some bit of sense. Otherwise, it's just a ploy to get me to keep watching. In this movie, Charlie's character is so one-dimensional that when he makes an attempt to be lovey-dovey with Grace it's not even remotely believable. I can blame Pesci a little for this, but it just seem as if he had much to work with.\nAnd for a movie that uses a brothel as its main background, there's very little naughty stuff going on; they may as well have set it in a video store, if those still existed. There's a side plot about some high-and-mighty moral compass waging a war against the legal brothel, but it's barely touched upon, pardon the pun. (The other puns are unpardonable.) The plot just bounces around from issue to issue, circling the main story threat of Bruza, Grace, and Charlie. The result is sometimes maudlin and hackneyed and other terms writers use to describe crappy writing."}

J.J. Abrams directed it, and Steven Spielberg produced. I expected a sentimental but exciting coming of age tale, derived somewhat from E.T. and from movies like Stand by Me. Then I remembered that J.J. Abrams was involved.\nThe year is 1979. A group of kids, making their own movie using a Super 8 camera, are present when a freight train crashes in their town. But the train's carrying some odd-behaving cargo, and soon the kids are swept up in an alphabet soup of conspiracy, mystery, death, unhealed emotional wounds, and love. You can see Spielberg's fingerprints on the sweet stuff, but the heavy lifting falls, unfortunately, to Abrams, who here gives us an unofficial follow-up to his last over-hyped ball of fire, Cloverfield.\nYou see, Super 8 is really two movies. One is sort of your standard something-is-amiss-in-a-small-town-and-the-military-is-hushing-it-up plot. The other is a more subtle, gentle look at growing and departing relationships, of loves past and present. And that's sort of where the problem lies for me; although the two genres can mesh well, here one part works very well and the other is a pile of predictability.\nThe protagonist is young Joe (Joel Courtney), best friends with Charles (Riley Griffiths). Joe's mom was killed in an accident at the local plant, an event that has had quite the effect on Joe and his relationship with his dad, the town's deputy. As you might guess, Joe's dad has grown distant with the loss of his wife, which he blames on the town drunk, leaving poor Joe sort of rudderless. That's one of the reasons he pals around with Charles and the rest of his friends, to escape.\nThe boys are making a movie with Charles as the director, and they ask one of their classmates, Alice (Elle Fanning) to play the female lead. Charles secretly likes Alice, but it becomes clear she has an eye for modest, unassuming Joe, who does makeup and lighting. At any rate, while they are filming near an old train station, a speeding train passes them by, then derails. After the kids emerge from the wreckage relatively unscathed, they recover their film.\nOf course, the train wasn't carrying ordinary cargo, as the film soon proves. But what is it? This is where the influence of Cloverfield kicks in. Abrams tries hard not to show us the creature in its entirety until near the end of the movie, but that didn't make it any scarier. The shots of the alien were amateurish, sometimes ridiculously staged as if straight out of a particularly poor B movie from 1953. I know the innocence of youth was a recurring theme, but I expected to be jumping a lot more than I was. In fact, here's an example of just shoddy filmmaking: there would be this intense, suspense-inducing music playing while the camera focused on one character, then sudden silence. And then, wouldn't you know it, an attack out of nowhere. No sir, didn't see that coming! So the exciting action scenes lacked a lot, like panache, creativity, chills, and even logic. Here's another example. During the trainwreck scene, the kids flee as debris rains all around them. Not just pieces of wood but rather entire cars, huge chunks of metal, and so on. They're never hit. All this stuff flying around, and they may as well have been in the perpetual center of a giant tornado. Sure, you have to suspend your disbelief, but there were a few howler scenes in this movie that really sort of forced you to metaphorically unhinge your jaw in order to properly suspend said disbelief.\nThe real upside to the movie, though, is the group of kids: they're a terrific, convincing lot. Luckily, we don't get stereotypical kids, like The Fat One or The Brain or The Slob, etc. Each isn't terribly defined, but they're not meant to be, and they're still memorable in their own way. They exist less as window dressing and more as a running color commentary on their various relationships.\nFanning is terrific as Alice. I almost didn't recognize her; at this age, she looks like a young Martha Plimpton, and if Ms. Fanning ever reads this, I mean that as praise. In a few scenes, she's playing a girl playing an actress, and she nails it. I have to believe it's not easy pretending to be something you're not anyway, so pretending to pretend just doubles the difficulty.\nSpielberg's touch is evident in the way the kids relate to each other and to adults; there are no cardboard caricatures, just honest characters. We see the wonderment and guileless glee that most of us had in grade school. We see kids being kids, in awe and curious but not terrified of the world around them.\nSpielberg's contribution works; Abrams' doesn't. If you liked Cloverfield and its poorly edited action scenes, this will be your bag. The bad guys are obvious, the impetus for the creature's existence is clear, and it's all telegraphed well ahead of time. They must have spent a fortune in CGI, mucking up what might have been a tender growing-up story set against an alien-invasion backdrop."}

It's a real throwback to the mindless action movies of the 1980s, and as an added flourish it even brings back some of the stars of those cheesefests. It's certainly not plot heavy, but it delivers what it promises \u2013 nonstop action, easily identifiable bad guys, and the occasional bon mot or two.\nSylvester Stallone plays Barney Ross, leader of a team of mercenaries. Ross is hired by the mysterious Mr. Church (note: not his real name) to travel to a remote island and overthrow a dictator. But, naturally, things aren't quite as they seem, although plenty of stuff blows up. Later, to redeem his soul, Ross returns to the island to set things aright, and more stuff blows up.\nRoss's team includes knife man Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), martial artist Yin Yang (Jet Li), weapons expert Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), demolitionist Toll Road (Randy Coutre), and sniper Gunner (Dolph Lundgren). Church is played by an uncredited Bruce Willis, and that's not a spoiler, since he featured in the trailer. Also in the trailer, showing up for one scene, is Arnold Schwarzenegger.\nThankfully, we're spared some real cheese, such as an \"I'm getting too old for this\" line or other references to the ages of some of the cast. Also along for the ride is Mickey Rourke as the owner of a tattoo parlor/bar, Eric Roberts and Stone Cold Steve Austin as bad guys. All are good at what they do, and truth be told Rourke brings plenty of effortless charisma to his minor role. This is not a movie that's miscast, and it's not a buyer's-remorse movie, either. You get what you expect to get when you mix these actors and this plot.\nThe movie's not heavy on plot. I've already touched on the high points, but really you could pop in at any moment during the film and pick up the storyline in no time. It's not Memento, for crying out loud. It's violent, very bloody, and terrifically well choreographed. The filmmakers wisely shot some of the more intense fight scenes in the dark, the better to mask the perhaps-not-awesome fighting abilities of some of the actors. But even though the action never lets up, it's not impossible to follow, and neither is it implausible. Okay, maybe a little disbelief must be suspended, but for the most part it's all reasonable.\nI enjoyed it. The Expendables proved to me that solid action movies that don't depend on a name brand can survive, as this one did rather well financially \u2013 well enough that a sequel is planned. It's not a disappointing movie if you like explosions and other manly pursuits. There are car chases, hot women, plenty of guns, exotic locales, and some plot. What more could you want?"}

Although arrestingly realistic, it can be a pretty painful ordeal to endure. In fact, it feels like such an immaculate representation of what it must be like to live through a horrific tragedy that one feels uneasy, restless, and depressed for hours afterward. So \u2013 know that going into the theater.\nAs the story begins, a college freshman named Sammy is calling his parents at home to check in. Mom Kate (Maria Bello) is a typical concerned parent, wanting her child to do well; Dad Bill (Michael Sheen) asks is Sam needs any money and is doing well, and he hangs up. The next morning, the terrible news: Sam has shot 18 students and teachers in his college before killing himself.\nThe movie wisely shows us nothing of the massacre; its focus is on the aftermath. Kate and Bill are staked out by the media. They escape to her brother's house to live with him, his wife, and their young son. They are vilified on television and online, particularly on Sam's Facebook. Their parenting is constantly questioned. In short time, they are questioning themselves: Did they make this happen? Kate and Bill had been drifting apart for some time, to the point where Bill was actively looking for a new place to live. The tragedy doesn't immediately bring them together, and it doesn't immediately drive them farther apart. Rather, they each drift some more, apart not just from each other but from reality. They blame themselves. They blame each other. They don't blame anyone. They continue on.\nThere's hardly a note in the movie that doesn't ring true. These characters are not caricatures, and they aren't archetypes, either. Both Bill and Kate seem completely believable, and with the tragedies in places such as Columbine and Virginia Tech, they are characters who very much feel like they could be living next door to us right now. That they are trashed and widely hated is understandable, and luckily neither character lacks the self-awareness to grasp why people are so mad. Bill reasons that the public wants to believe that the couple feels bad about what their son has done. They do, of course. They show their deepening anguish in different ways, but their devastation is complete. Their lives are seemingly ruined.\nBut this is not a movie without any hope. The subject matter is gruesome, but it's not tiresome. What we see are real reactions from realistic people. There are no real good guys, just a couple of people who've suddenly lost their way. Whether they regain it is almost immaterial, just as it's almost immaterial whether they regain it together. For us, it's the journey from their discovery through the passage of a week or so that's the true endgame. Neither does the film wallow in sentimentality for the sake of making us feel good. The true moments of joy are fleeting, just as they can be in real life. Even a dark movie can contain passionate performances."}

The Pirates of the Caribbean movies aren't really awful, but they are no longer the ground-breaking spectacle that the original was. So it was with lowered expectations that I watched the latest effort, and I can gladly say that the movie exceeded those low expectations. Damning with faint praise? Yes.\nThis time around, we've lost the characters of Will and Elizabeth, which is a good thing. I don't know about the rest of you, but I was getting tired of the triangle they formed with Jack Sparrow. The two characters were just getting annoying and in the way of Johnny Depp, so when their stories were pretty definitively ended at the conclusion of the third movie, I was happy. Taking Elizabeth's place as the story's heroine is Angelica, daughter of Blackbeard and played by the luminous Penelope Cruz. Like Elizabeth Swan, Angelica can kick butt and take names; the difference is that Cruz is far more convincing in the role than Keira Knightley ever was in her. Cruz's presence gives the franchise a much-needed jolt of fiery Latin temper, to use a clich\u00e9 that happens to fit nicely here.\nAs for the character of Will Scarlett, the noble Everyman/blacksmith played by Orlando Bloom, his replacement would probably be the clergyman who finds himself in the service of Blackbeard, trying valiantly to \"save\" him. As the movie progressed, I began to sense that Philip the Good would somehow let slip the bonds of his faith and fall for someone. I knew that someone wouldn't be Angelica the daughter of Blackbeard, and a quick glance at the trailer showed me his eventual target. So, like Scarlett before him, Philip finds love where he never thought he'd find it. Trouble is, that relationship was starkly uninteresting to me. I'm not sure if Sam Claflin, who played the character, or the screenwriters, is to blame, but boy and howdy was that part of the plot a giant bore. If there's a Pirates 5 \u2013 and who are we kidding, of course there must be \u2013 I hope Philip and his new love don't make an appearance.\nSo what made this one palatable, anyway? You minus the two more wearisome characters from the last one and add a temptress, and you're good to go. Plus you add in Ian McShane as the diabolical Blackbeard, and he's an actual bad guy, unlike Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who's jumped sides about as often as Jack Sparrow himself \u2013 and here begins the movie in the employ of the British King.\nThe stunts are well staged as usual, and good use was made of the location shooting on Oahu and Puerto Rico. Never let it be said that a Pirates movie wasn't fun to look AT. But an added benefit for me was that I watched the movie in 2D, even though it was also available in 3D. Why, you ask? Well, I'm glad you asked, Imaginary Reader. You see, when a movie is shot in 3D, the 3D process absorbs some of the light; therefore, if a movie features scenes in darkened environs \u2013 like caves, the ocean blue, underwater, jungles \u2013 then it'll be so dark that one will have a lot of trouble seeing what's going on. And for this you'd pay an extra few dollars. Ain't worth it. So if you do see this in 3D, you may want dial this rating down a notch.\nOverall, the movie \u2013 and the franchise \u2013 owes quite a bit to Mr. Depp. Yes, he IS Jack Sparrow, and it's impossible to imagine the movie without him. And even though this is his fourth go-round as Sparrow, Johnny Depp's enthusiasm doesn't seem to flag a bit; he sells the character wholeheartedly and joyfully. He is, as usual, a lot of fun to watch.\nOh, yes, the plot. Nutshell: Barbossa (with the British), the Spanish, and Blackbeard (with zombies on his crew, of course) are all trying to find the Fountain of Youth. Sparrow had the map, Mr. Gibbs \u2013 Sparrow's first mate all these movies \u2013 memorized it and burned it, and there you go. And there's a prophecy about a one-legged man, and there are mermaids. It's like Harry Potter without house elves."}

And although Nicolas Cage plays the lead, it's a pretty respectable action fantasy with all the requisite elements: magic, valor, love, villains, and a Chosen One.\nYou might be taken aback by the fact that Cage, whose intensity has been stuck in overdrive lo these many years, plays it pretty straight here. He's Balthazar, one of three apprentices to the great Merlin; one of the other two is named Horvath, and he betrayed Merlin and the other good guys to Morgana Le Fay \u2013 yes, she of Arthurian legend, not the kissing bandit \u2013 but now both of them and other assorted bad sorcerers are trapped in an ancient doll. Not for long, one suspects.\nEnter Dave Stutler (Jay Baruchel), a nebbish if there ever was one. Dave's a science geek who's still haunted by an earlier encounter with Balthazar, ten years earlier, that resulted in what looked like a fifth-grade Dave wetting himself. Therapy has worked some wonders in the meantime for poor Dave, but some of those memories come rushing back when he runs into Balthazar again, as well as the girl on whom his younger self had a crush, dashed by the not-really urination.\nLuckily for us, the backstory of Balathzar, Morgana, Horvath, and the rest is explained in narration by Ian McShane, who lends just the right amount of gravitas. I'll sum up: all those bad guys are now in this doll, trapped magically in various layers, which is nice except someone's lost the doll. Hm. Oh, but there's more. Seems that a dying Merlin told Balthazar that only the True Merlinian (no, I'm not making that up) would be able to defeat Morgana once and for all, before she raises all the old sorcerers to form a super army to take over the world. Guess who that True Merlinian might be. You'll never guess.\nParallel to poor Dave having to save the world at the behest of the scraggly, world-weary Balthazar, we also have the plot of a love refound, as it seems the girl of ten-year-old Dave's dreams is still around, working at a radio station at NYU. Believe me, her side gig is quite important in terms of the story, as is Dave's own research into the use of Tesla coils. All of which allows the filmmakers to show of their CGI of synchronized Tesla coils.\nThere's plenty to recommend about this movie, which feels just strange in and of itself. As I alluded, Cage underplays his role here, allowing Baruchel to get a bit more of the limelight. The effects are convincing and entertaining and don't feel at all forced or artificial. The main bad guy isn't one dimensional, and he's acted with vicious glee by Alfred Molina. Even the romance doesn't feel like it's been shoehorned in; Dave's courting of Becky seems genuine and heartfelt without being sappy slop.\nKids will like this, but be warned that some of the action scenes are fairly intense. A little darker than, say, A Night at the Museum, but more along the lines of the recent Mummy films. I mean, Jon Turteltaub is the director, and Jerry Bruckheimer is the producer. So we're not talking about a gory, terrifying movie; this is a film that takes somewhat-familiar material and repurposes it for a modern audience. It's based on the same 1797 poem by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. I wouldn't expect a franchise to develop, but this was still a nicely done, vibrant, and exciting little film."}

It can't possibly be straightfaced, because not only would that be in opposition to the premise of the original, it would be a massive failure. This version will surely disappoint anyone who takes it to be serious horror cinema. Sure, there's gore, but it's funny gore.\nIf it's meant to be humorous, then Piranha is an uproarious, unmitigated success. It's about on par with the recent spate of SyFy Original horror movies, the ones with prehistoric crocodiles and octopuses and the like. It's also probably one of those rare recent movies that looks better in 3D than in 2D; in the latter format, you can tell where the object was supposed to look like it was coming right at you, because instead it sort of floats there, disinterested and bathed in ennui. Which is what you'll be if you take this movie seriously.\nThe setting is a remote lake in Arizona, which is apparently a spring-break destination for thousands of nubile, hormone-laden teens. A mild earthquake under the lake causes a new fissure that joins one underwater lake with another - and the second underwater lake is home to the titular fish. Only they're not your typical piranha, which of course aren't from around those parts anyway, they're prehistoric, or something. Christopher Lloyd, who plays the local animal expert, says so.\nElisabeth Shue plays the sheriff, and she has a working force of what appears to be three or four guys. Sure, one of them is Ving Rhames, but really? To control all those teenagers? That makes sense.\nThe sheriff's kid, played by Steve McQueen's grandson, is a Nice Guy who agrees to take a skin-flick producer (Jerry O'Connell) to a secluded lake spot so he can do some filming - instead of watching his younger brother and sister, who immediately go off in a rowboat and get lost. It's that kind of movie.\nMeanwhile, the piranha, released by the quake, take aim at scores of barely dressed women. And some guys, I'm not sure. There's a lot of blood, so it's hard to be certain. A literal bloodbath. There's decapitations, hair caught in propellers, slices and dices, and, well you get the idea. Lots of red stuff, lots of half-naked people. But it's more gross than engrossing.\nAt one point, the sheriff calls in the National Guard. At the time, I thought that seemed like overkill, because all the cops had to do was get the kids out of the water - i.e., Close the Beach. But when that proved to be too much for them, I could see her point. In any event, the National Guard never shows up, perhaps the smartest thing they did that day.\n(Really - the cops yell at the kids to get out of the water, and the celebrating resumes, mostly unabated, with music blaring. A gunshot to the boombox would have solved that.) Although the movie's pretty funny, in a sick-minded way, it could have been funnier still. Shue's cop corps isn't bumbling, which might have made for some wacky hijinks. What we have are smart people doing either nothing at all or only vaguely dumb things, like leave their teenage son home to watch the youngsters when there are literally hundreds of horny, drunk women waiting for him.\nThis Piranha has little of merit. The old one featured some old-time stars, like Dick Miller and Barbara Steele, and was fairly serious. And it worked. Joe Dante did a great job on a limited budget. Here, a lot of money was spent on a lot of nothing. There are no scares, and it's possible that the added dimension would just make it funnier."}

Reilly plays John, a slovenly ne'er-do-well editor (hmm!) who's having a hard time dealing with the breakup of his marriage, several years ago. Yes, years. At any rate, he's reluctant to reenter the dating race at his age, but at the behest of his ex-wife (Catherine Keener) he attends a party and meets cute with free spirited Molly (Marisa Tomei). \nAll goes surprisingly well. John can't believe his good luck, but he does find it odd that Molly always wants to meet at his house and departs in the middle of the night. At first, John figures Molly's married, but her secret is even more nefarious - she has a 22-year-old son named Cyrus, played by Jonah Hill. \nIf this has been a simple competition between the man and the man-child for Molly's affections, it might have worked. But it's much more deviant than that. There's no comedy to speak of, just a lot of vile attitudes on the part of each \"competitor\"; naturally, Molly is (intentionally?) unaware of her son's malicious intent, believing that he simply needs to \"grow into himself.\" \nReilly is a great sad-sack character actor. He was the cuckold in Chicago, after all, and he really tries his best to make John to be the good guy, an appealing, sympathetic character. But the writing does him in. When we're supposed to feel that John's a decent sort, the script calls for him to be a jerk. But that's nothing compared to what Hill is asked to do as Cyrus; even at the beginning, when Cyrus is glad handling John early in their relationship, at no point are we convinced that Cyrus has his mother's best interests at heart. Ever. Right from the get-go, we can easily see past Cyrus's smile and staged sincerity; he immediately has no credibility, which makes his actions thenceforth to be even more reprehensible and aggravating.\nThere's no one to really like here. We can't like Cyrus, because we can see he's kind of a jerk right away. We can't like Molly, because she's so unbelievably clueless. And we can't even like John, because he sinks to Cyrus' level. I think you sort of need to like someone, anyone, in a movie. There has to be some sort of appeal. If you have a movie of insincere bastards, then you're going to get a weak, dislikeable movie.\nThere's not even a scene that's not spelled out well in advance. No surprises; the characters behave just as anyone in a similar movie would behave. So, replete with predictability and bitterness, Cyrus isn't a winner in any sense."}

The entire cast is engaging \u2013 and some very nice to look at, depending on your persuasion \u2013 and all in all it's a well-told glorious spectacle.\nThor (Chris Hemsworth) is an Asgardian prince, son of King Odin (check your Norse mythology). Hot-headed, impetuous, prone to violence, and quite full of himself, he is nonetheless next in line for the throne. Just before his coronation is complete, however, intruders from Jotunheimm infiltrate Asgard; although they're quickly dispatched, Thor demands revenge, and against his father's explicit orders, he and his friends (including his brother, Loki) travel to Jotunheim to seek answers \u2013 and kick butt, if necessary and possible. Odin finds out and saves them, but he strips Thor of his powers \u2013 including his great hammer, Mjolnir, and banishes him to Earth to teach him a lesson in humility.\nThis banishment serves to open the door for treachery in Asgard, allowing the Frost Giants of Jotunheim to wage war against the Asgardians. Meanwhile, some of that trouble is spilled toward Earth, where Thor has fallen under the romantic spell of Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). Suffice to say that bad things come at the populace of a small town in New Mexico, with only a now-mortal Thor able to help them.\nBut this movie is about more than just bad guys plotting to take over the universe; it's about father-son relationships and the rivalry between a favored son and \"the other brother.\" There's a lot of Henry V and King Lear afoot, and this is due in no small part to the movie's director, the great Kenneth Branagh. Branagh is not the first person you'd think of to direct a movie based on a comic book, but he manages here to not only keep the expected characterizations and plot fresh but also to instill a sense of classicism and wonderment.\nThe CGI is pretty well utilized (although some of the early scenes in Jotunheim made me realize they WERE computer generated, which is almost the opposite of what you'd want), and what's more it doesn't seem to distract from the plot. In some movies, effects serve as noise to prevent the audience from discovering that the story doesn't make much sense. Branagh isn't subtle in his use of technology, but this isn't a movie that really should be subtle. Thor himself certainly isn't.\nHemsworth, a newcomer to the States from Australia, is solid in the title role, much better than, say, Sam Worthington would have been. Hemsworth is sturdy and ripped, so he fits Thor's physical description, but he can also do a little bit of the acting as well. Portman, you may recall, is now an Oscar winner, and she's a delight here in a role similar to Liv Tyler's and Jennifer Connelly's in the two recent Hulk films; the smart femme fatale. In fact, her character reminded me quite a bit of Jodie Foster's character in Contact \u2013 a determined, resolved, super-smart researcher determined to find out what in Sam Hill is going on around here.\nAnthony Hopkins plays Odin as you'd expect Anthony Hopkins to play a king: regally, with a weary toughness. Idris Elba, Kat Denning, Stellan Skarsgard, Tom Hiddleston, Ray Stevenson, and a couple of uncredited cameos are also well cast.\nYou can expect to see more of Thor and his stories \u2013 his Thories? \u2013 in the coming years. This movie is a product of Marvel Studios, and upcoming releases will focus on other Marvel Comics' characters, such as Captain America and The Avengers. Plus there are to be reboots of Spider-Man and (maybe) The Hulk. And they'll all tie together, along with Iron Man.\nSo Thor is every bit as entertaining as I thought it'd be. It's classy without being out of reach for the rest of us; it's not some highfalutin Royal Theater production, but neither is it a simple slam-bang cacophony of senseless violence."}

Styled almost exactly like the graphic novel on which it's based, it permits the viewer to suspend disbelief with some degree of plausible deniability; that is, we're not asked to believe the impossible or even highly improbable, like using two sports cars to rip the door off a safe.\nPilgrim (Michael Cera) is a bass player in a garage band. Scott's 22 and is now dating a 17-year-old high school student named Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). That may seem unorthodox at first, but bear in mind that Michael Cera looks like he's 16 anyway, so it's not as stark a contrast as it may seem. Anyway, Knives thinks Scott's awesome, and he just sort of tolerates her. They haven't even kissed.\nBut then one night at a party, Scott sees Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a purple-coiffed drifter with a blas\u00e9 attitude that belies something... well, something dark and mysterious, if nothing else. And Scott does everything he can to find out more about Ramona, much to the chagrin of his bandmates, his gay roommate (Kieran Culkin), and his sister (Anna Kendrick).\nOkay, cutting to the chase. Turns out that although the worldly Ramona does sorta-kinda like Scott, she has issues. Like evil exes. And so the crux of the story comes about - Scott must defeat her seven evil exes. How? Well, with kung fu, karate, judo, other fighting styles, and various weapons. Why? Well, to win her heart, of course! Oh, did you want more details than that? Let's just say that Scott Pilgrim is essentially a video game based on a graphic novel. There are levels (each ex representing one level); beat the level/ex, you move on to the next one, and so on. Each ex has special powers; so do you, just like in a video game. And when you beat them, they don't lay there all bloody and whatnot; they turn into gold coins. Just like in real life! One of the truly entertaining aspects of the movie is how director Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead) integrates this video-game mentality into the plot line seamlessly. Characters don't act astounded that someone can shoot fire from their hands or fly through the air or cause demons to emerge from a DJ board. It's expected. And Scott Pilgrim himself isn't amazed that he can kick butt with his... well, with his feet. Which is how you kick things. So add in the video-game effects and then a splash of Batman (1966) sound effects, complete with the onomatopoeic words appearing above the action. Lovely visual touch.\nThe movie is witty, too. It's not just a series of wacky adventures peppered with impossible effects. Pilgrim is no hero - he's cheating on two women! - but is just likable enough to be a real protagonist. He's more a victim of his own desires. He tries his best to be everything to everyone, which isn't a role that Michael Cera is unfamiliar with. I mean, he looks wimpy but engaging, sort of like a beagle. He gets to fight some excellent exes, too, like Chris Evans as a hubristic actor (complete with stunt doubles!) and Jason Schwartzman as the Machiavellian proto-jerk villain.\nScott Pilgrim is a solidly different film. It's part action, part comedy, big part whimsy. It's daring and unconventional, and from a purely visual standpoint is really remarkably made. It's exciting and entertaining."}

But did Mary Suratt really have anything to do with the scheme? The government seems to think so, but they're really just interested in finding someone, anyone, to blame for Lincoln's death. You know, to help the nation get past the tragedy and move on.\nIn 1865, an Anerican citizen accused of a capital crime could be tried before a military tribunal, so War Secretary Edwin Stanton (Kevin Kline) sets one up, one loaded with friendly Union generals and headed by David Hunter (Colm Meaney). The Justice Department is tasked with defending each of the accused separately, but Reverdy Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) turns Mary Suratt's case over to counselor Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy), a decorated war veteran, reasoning that although the deck's stacked against Suratt as it is, the tribunal would be more receptive to a Yankee than to a southerner.\nAs the first release of American Film Company and directed by no less than Robert Redford, The Conspirator's goal seems to be to try to set the record straight. Oh, it doesn't hold the grand ideal that the accused were actually innocent or that even John Wilkes Booth was just a disinterested spectator. In fact, one could say that the guilt or innocence of Mary Suratt is really beside the point. By casting a light on the circumstances of the trial and the conduct of the contemporary elected officials, Redford is actually drawing a parallel with the present-day ordeals of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. That's because the point here is that the basic rights granted by the country's Constitution are not suddenly voided during times of war, a case that's made during the trial.\nOur Founding Fathers, attempting to distance themselves from what they felt was a repressive regime in England, laid down some fundamental rights that apply to all citizens. One of them is the presumption of innocence, with the burden of proof on the accuser. These rights are so sacred, so crucial to the fabric of the country that they supersede everything, Redford argues here. (He's right.) That means that no matter how heinous a crime may be, its accused must receive the best possible defense. Redford tries to show that at every turn, the government tried to predetermine the trial's outcome, and specifically the fate of Mary Suratt, which would, in the film's view, be a tremendous undercutting of the country's core values.\nAs Mary Suratt, Robin Wright is fantastic; grim, determined, motherly, strong, resolved. She has a nice meaty role and does a lot with it; you don't sympathize with her because she may be innocent but because she may not be receiving fair treatment at all. She has twin motivations, always sparring: she wishes to save herself from hanging, but she also wishes to save her son \u2013 the only accused conspirator to get away \u2013 from the same fate. Wright's inner turmoil is evident with every turn of her head, every downcast eyebrow.\nThis is a movie that's filled with bad actors turning in unusually solid performances. First, you have McAvoy, who was so gosh-awful in movies like Atonement and The Last King of Scotland. He, too, is conflicted; he spent years fighting the very people on the battlefield that he must now defend. But McAvoy, although a bit of a lightweight, does offer a more passionate performance than his usual robotic demeanor.\nThen there are Danny Huston (as the prosecutor), who's come a long way from junky performances in movies like Silver City, The Aviator, and The Constant Gardener. He's okay, which is a compliment. Even Justin Long, as one of Aiken's buddies, isn't terrible (as he was in, say, Drag Me to Hell, which he dragged to the ground). Others, like Alexis Bledel (as Aiken's squeeze), with an anachronistic Valley Girl accent, don't fare as well.\nOverall, the movie makes its point succinctly and with conviction, not to mention with quite a bit of subtlety. It doesn't glamorize the bad guys, doesn't make you \"see the other side of the issue\" (in the sense that you don't exactly feel for the South), doesn't look for a happy medium where we can all get along. It recognizes a grave injustice powered by people who thought they knew better."}

Like it wasn't sure what it wanted to be. Was it about good versus evil? The little tots who wind up in almost every scene were barely seen in the initial trailers. So I had sort of dismissed the movie. But that was a wrong decision, as the movie has a lot of heart, terrific voice performances, and a simple, plausible plot that can please both youngsters and cranky old people. And the rest of you.\nGroo (Steve Carell) is the world's number-one supervillain. He lives in a lair that's beset on all sides by suburbia, and deep within that lair are house his thousands of minions, tiny little alien-looking creatures who serve to live and live to serve. (They sort of remind me of the alien toys from Toy Story.)\nGroo is a mastermind who has big, big plans \u2013 he wants to go to the moon, shrink it, bring it back to earth, and ransom it for untold riches. To do this, he needs a loan from an evil banker (Will Arnett), who won't even talk to him until Groo can produce the needed shrink ray. Meanwhile, Groo isn't the only evil bastard out there, as a new kid on the block named Vector (Jason Segal) is already outdoing him in sheer villainy, having swiped the Great Pyramid of Giza.\nVector has the shrink ray, and Groo has a problem. He hits upon a most cynical solution \u2013 he'll use orphans! He adopts a trio of little girls (led by Miranda Cosgrove) who have been tasked with selling cookies door to door, and it turns out Vector's ordered a huge batch. Groo sees this as a way into Vector's own lair, thus allowing him to grab the gun and get the loan and shrink the moon and get all the riches in the world! But he doesn't quite count on the girls' charms. It's said that Groo's heart grew (ha, unintended pun) three sizes that day.\nCarell gives Groo a Slavic/Russian accent that's reminiscent of, among others, Bela Lugosi and Blofeld. The voice and the character are a perfect match, and Carell is terrific as he always seems to be in his voice work. Groo looks like The Penguin, come to think of it, adding another layer of villainy.\nAnyway, one thing that makes this work is that the shift from Groo as terrifying bad guy to cuddly father figure is slight, slow, and completely believable. Imagine if you hated kids, or at least had no real use for them. Then you do find a use and figure you can discard them later on, only you find it ain't that easy. Never is with kids, is it? The movie could have taken the easier way of having Groo recruit the kidlets to help him in his nefarious scenes, but instead they have him blindly pretend nothing is amiss, that the minions are his cousins, and so on. Subtlety is key.\nThe animation is pretty good, about what you'd expect. It was probably a real hoot to see in 3D, but alas I saw it on my home screen, which is still in 2D and will remain so until the industry has its act together. But even in 2D, it's an exciting, entertaining movie, and it has some 3D-oriented surprises during the end credits."}

She can kill and gut an elk, she can engage in hand-to-hand combat, and she can fire a weapon. Sort of leaves no room for toys and television, but her dad has good reason to fear for her safety \u2013 he's actually a former CIA officer who's gone rogue, missing from the world for a long time.\nThe time finally comes, though, when Hanna feels she is ready to deal with the world. Father Erik shows her a transmitter he's kept hidden away all this time; if she truly believes she is ready, he tells her, she need only to flip the switch, and the CIA will come after her. He and Hanna make plans to meet up in Berlin, and off we go with the thrust of the plot.\nHanna isn't ordinary, her odd upbringing notwithstanding. She has amazing strength and reflexes and is a tremendously quick learner (her dad teaches her from old encyclopedias). Sure enough, she flips that switch, and sure enough, the CIA is quickly on the scene, thinking that although it's lost its primary target (Erik), they at least have his scared, vulnerable daughter. Oh, how they wrong they are.\nHanna must navigate her way from detention by the authorities to her scheduled rendezvous with her father in Berlin, which as you all know is quite a distance from the North Pole. Mostly she walks, but she does manage to ingratiate herself into a traveling family for a short time, becoming friends with the daughter, played by Jessica Barden. Hanna's able to use the family to get her into Europe, at least, all the while being pursued by German assassins at the behest of Erik's longtime CIA handler, Marissa (Cate Blanchett).\nI think that any movie in which female characters are shown to be strong and resourceful \u2013 and that these qualities are depicted as positive, not negative \u2013 is one to be lauded. Hanna and Marissa are well matched; each is capable of kicking butt and declining to take names, each is personable but ruthless and single minded. They're not easy women to defeat.\nThe movie is tightly plotted (written by Seth Lochhead, his first feature), doling out pieces of information about Hanna's past as if they were the remaining rations on a deserted island, and although there is plenty of action \u2013 and some terrific choreography \u2013 none of it distracts from the plot itself. Sometimes, a lesser film will lean heavily on those action pieces as a bit of sleight of hand, all to prevent the viewer from putting two and two together. Here, it's more like the square root of eight plus pi. I overstate it, but you get the drift. Not everything means something, and some things mean everything.\nThe film is also quickly paced and expertly shot (by Alwin Kuchler) \u2013 again, without making things into such a blur that a fist and a blunt instrument blend into interchangeable weapons. Most of the fight scenes look as if they are actually taking place, which is probably true; the film never has a CGI feel to it, although it wouldn't surprise me if some of those stunts just plain had to be technically created.\nHanna is a terrific thriller that does not depend heavily on visual effects to engage the viewer, instead merely using them to supplement a well-written plot with no gaping holes. It's electric mayhem, to borrow from The Muppets, with dual towering performances by Ronan and Blanchett, the former making up for her earlier work in Atonement (directed by Joe Wright, who helmed Hanna). Ronan in Atonement was annoying, wooden, and obnoxious; Ronan in Hanna has grown up, steely, resolved, and deep. She's a real pleasure to watch here, and she carries the film."}

There are the hero cops, and there are the other guys, the cops who do all the dirty, nonglamorous work. And this is their story. Wait, that's not a terribly good premise at all. Who cares about the other guys? What kind of an action movie would focus on the other guys? This one, which pairs accountant-like Will Ferrell with hotheaded Mark Wahlberg, each with an implausible past necessary to keep their characters out of the limelight and on light or otherwise boring duty. Each is envious of their precinct's hotshots, played by Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson. But then the heroes are taken out of the equation, and it's up to the other guys to step up and solve some high-handed financial scheme.\nFerrell and Wahlberg have no chemistry. They're just another set of mismatched cops with differing views on everything. Wahlberg pines for his ex, a ballerina; Ferrell is married to drop-dead-gorgeous Eva Mendes (whom he pretends is a Plain Jane, har har), and that's about the most plausible thing about the movie. One cop is straightlaced, the other is not. One cop drives a Prius, the other\u0085wait, Wahlberg doesn't even own a car. So the only reason Ferrell drives a Prius is that it's easy to make fun of someone who drives one. Both cops are constantly berated and insulted by their coworkers for no discernible reason. They're not wacky, they're wacked.\nIs The Other Guys a comedy? Couldn't prove it by me. There's not a joke to be found, really; the paper-thin characterizations wear very, very quickly. It's as is the writers decided that Ferrell and Wahlberg would each be a particular type \u2013 but then found nothing funny to write about them. And let's face it, having one guy scream all the time and the other guy nerding up the joint doesn't automatically make things humorous. There are no gags, although you will gag at the ineptitude with which this movie was written (partly by Ferrell stalwart Adam McKay). There are no hilarious set pieces, no random bits of absurdity. It's a faceless, directionless pile of pablum that can't even muster up the energy to lampoon cop movies.\nThe supporting cast is wasted. Johnson and Jackson are out of it early, conveniently enough, but even their scenes are one dimensional; they exist merely to show what Ferrell and Wahlberg aspire to be. (It should also be noted that the stunts in this movie strain credulity past the breaking point, with the lone exception of an early Johnson/Jackson scene.) It's as if the film were a movie about the making of cop movies, with all of the cops played by bottom-of-the-barrel stuntmen.\nMendes is terrific and beautiful, and she actually gets some of the best lines in the film, as does Michael Keaton as the guys' boss, Gene Mauch \u2013 so named because Ferrell, in real life, is an Angels baseball fan, and Mauch was the name of their longtime manager. On the other hand, Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans, Jr. (oh, no, not another one) are as hilarious as constipation; they serve no purpose other than to be annoying, cruel, vapid, and stupid.\nIt's saying something that the only real punch a movie provides is during its end credits. In this case, a series of increasingly alarming stats rolls across the scene, focusing on bailout money and bonuses paid to already-rich people who helped caused financial destruction in the United States. What that has to do with this movie is a connection that can be made only tenuously."}

It's not particularly memorable.\nMatthew McConnaughey stars as Mick Haller, a high-powered lawyer who operates (mostly) out of his Lincoln Town Car, shepherded around by a besuited driver. At least that's the idea \u2013 he's in the car for maybe three or four scenes. Anyway, he's been hired by the family of a rich lad, played by Ryan Phillippe, who's accused of battering a woman in her home after she picked him up at a local bar. But it's not long before Haller realizes that the case may have something to do with an earlier case of his, one in which his client (Michael Pena) wound up being sent to San Quentin. Seems like there may be quite a bit more to this rich kid's case than meets the eye.\nHaller is typical of the heroes you see in those Grisham novels/films. He knows when to play the system and when to buck it. He's a family man, even though he and his wife, played by the luminous Marisa Tomei, are divorced. He puts in long hours to work on his cases \u2013 and why not, he gets a lot of money for doing so. He has an experienced investigator, played by a scruffy-looking William H. Macy. He doesn't have the affected twang of a Grisham hero, so his shtick here is his omnipresent Lincoln. Except when it's not present, which is really quite often.\nMatthew McConnaughey tries his best, just as he does in most movies, but he's just up against too much predictability. As likable as he can be in character \u2013 even when he's a bit of a jerk, like in Tropic Thunder, which got him this gig \u2013 his likability can only carry a picture so far. And although it helps that there are a lot of talented folks in the movie with him, their cache combined just isn't enough to overcome the overwrought, indifferent, clich\u00e9-riddled plot. McConnaughy is charming and sly, working the refs so effortlessly as an ethically challenged lawyer, that you almost forget that the conclusion is basically forgone. Oh, sure there's a twist, if you can call it that. The movie even wants us to believe there are two of them.\nBut The Lincoln Lawyer is just full of McGuffins, too many incidental characters who nevertheless Mean Something, and way too much wasted talent. It's done in by implausibilities and the notion that only the Hero can figure anything out \u2013 if he doesn't, it means he's been set up or lied to. It's even sort of repetitive to have McConnaughey as the lead here; he already had the experience of being the Hero in the adaptation of Grisham's A Time to Kill.\nSo, skip it. When your movie's big hook is that your hero operates his law practice out of his car, and then you show him driving himself around in other cars, or being driven around in other cars, or being in court, or basically doing everything but conduct business out of the back of his car, then you have no hook. And, ergo, no movie."}

One is pretty dang impressive, especially from a visual standpoint, and the other is really just mediocre. Combined, they make a half-decent film. It's one of those movies that looks so good and is set against a backdrop with sufficient surreality that one can easily not only suspend disbelief but also expel it, semipermanently, from one's mind.\nA diminutive girl (Emily Browning) is thrown into an insane asylum by her evil stepfather after she accidentally kills her younger sister while defending her from his advances. Once in there, she's befriended/mocked/ostracized/encouraged by a group of young ladies, led by Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish). The asylum, we quickly learn, is really a very expensive brothel, and the girls earn their keep.\nWhen the girl, named Baby Doll, is asked to dance during the girls' ballet practice by their taskmaster teacher Dr. Gorski (Carla Gugino), she retreats into an imaginary world that would put make Alice's Wonderland look like a trip to JC Penney's. Within this fantasy world, Baby Doll learns from a wise man (Scott Glenn) that she will need to locate certain artifacts in order to make her escape. When she comes out of her reverie \u2013 to much applause, as apparently her dance was just that good \u2013 Baby Doll has formed her plan.\nImagination is a powerful tool. Each time Baby Doll dances, she is able to get closer to her ultimate goal. But she isn't alone, not even in these fantasies \u2013 she is joined by Sweet Pea, Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), and Amber (Jamie Chung). One moment they're fighting the Germans in a steampunk warfront, the next they're in a Lord of the Rings setting, and so on, all to get those artifacts. That's the good, impressive movie. The meh one is the plot line outside of those fantasy scenes. True, the actresses all seem to have good chemistry with one another, but what we basically get is an evil asylum leader with lascivious intentions that are eclipsed only by his unmitigated greed. We do get quite a bit of urgency, too, as Baby Doll is scheduled for a lobotomy in just five days' time. And while Oscar Isaac, as bad guy Blue Jones, is hissable as a villain, there's almost no depth to his character at all, making his scenes with the girls excruciating and pointless to watch.\nHere's something I did find a little odd. Browning, all bright eyed and bushy tailed, looked to me to be in her mid teens, an older sister to a single-digit sib. But when she's checked into the asylum by her stepfather, her age is given as 20. I don't know if Browning, who really is 22, looked 20 in this movie. But maybe that's a minor quibble.\nThe visuals will remind you of director Zack Snyder's earlier work with 300 and Watchmen, with maybe a smidge of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. Sweeping, violent, visceral war scenes, improbable action, the works. When the girls descend to kick ass \u2013 be the ass German, robot, orc, what have you \u2013 their movements are even less believable than those of the Crazy 88s in Kill Bill Vol. 1. But that's intentional, and here it works.\nOverall, Sucker Punch is entertaining, and it delivers on its own premise. It's full of truly astounding cinematography, spectacular but not dizzying, and it features some pretty damn commanding performances, particularly by Browning, Cornish, and Malone."}

Sounds like movie-of-the-week fluff, but the movie is never manipulative. It's a terrific, old-school sentimental film that tears your heart out without stooping to clich\u00e9s. In fact, it absolutely brilliant not only in spinning its main theme but in how it sets that father-son connection against a wholly accurate musical background. The music, that is, ain't there just to showcase a period.\nWe meet our leads right away. It's 1986, and father Henry (J.K. Simmons) and mother Helen (Cara Seymour) Sawyer have just discovered that their long-estranged son Gabriel (Lou Taylor Pucci) is in a hospital, diagnosed with a large brain tumor. The tumor is operable and benign, but the doctor tells the stricken parents that Gabriel - whom they haven't seen in about twenty years - can no longer form new memories. What he does remember ends at about 1970.\nAfter trying all sorts of medicines and other therapies, Henry finds an article written by a musical therapist, Dianne Daley (Julia Ormond); Daley tries to use music to bring Gabriel back to the present, as he still believes it's 1970 or so. And she quickly learns - no spoiler here - that although Gabriel is musically inclined, he reacts positively only to music from the late 1960s and thereabouts, especially that of the Grateful Dead.\nNow, confession time. Those of you who know me well know that I am a Deadhead. Have been on the bus for a long time now. So I had high expectations for this movie, perhaps expectations that even differed from other viewers. And I can confidently say that the movie far exceeded those expectations.\nHere's why. The movie doesn't just use the music as a prop to move the plot forward. Why does Gabriel react positively only to this music? What happened in 1970? We do find out, and it is very important. But the impetus for Gabriel's leaving home as a teenager is closely tied to the connection each of us feels with our own favorite music. Everyone has some song they love, the movie tells us, and when we hear that song we are taken back to a time and place that is unique to our memories. Others may hear the same song and are affected differently by it. In Gabriel's case, the songs from that era represent the last time he was truly all right. When his parents hear the same songs in 1986, their memories are colored by what they've experienced since then.\nGabriel is never depicted as a simple, brain-dead hippie. He's just some kid who's in a band, like so many long-haired youths were back then, emulating groups like The Beatles, the Stones, and yes, the Dead. Playing covers. Enjoying themselves, falling in love. Gabriel not only knows all of the current (for the time) bands, he knows the meanings behind songs such as Dylan's \"Desolation Row.\" Gabriel, for a high-school kid, is a pretty deep thinker.\nHe shares his love of music with his father, who grew up with more staid orchestral arrangements - some Count Basie, some Bing Crosby, and so on. Completely different music, and yet each uses his favorite songs to relate to favorite memories.\nHenry eventually does realize that the best way to communicate with his son is to learn every Grateful Dead song and then play the records for him when he visits Gabriel in his hospice-like home. Anything, you see, to try to get his son back to him.\nIt doesn't matter if you like the Dead's music. It really doesn't. As any tour veteran would tell you, the experience of a show is one you'll never get anywhere else. Often imitated, never duplicated. There's a lot going on, and event is a culture unto itself. In this movie, director Jim Kohlberg uses some of the songs and a (staged) concert in order to depict this experience, and truthfully it's as accurate as it could possibly be - well, for a movie that uses no authentic concert footage.\nThis is not a movie that will make you laugh very often. Gabriel gets off some bon mots, some of which are unintentional, what with the memory loss thing. Simmons gets great lines, too. But essentially, this is a sad movie that never wallows in melodrama, a feat that most movies simply can't pull off. The movie engages us with the characters, makes us love them and regard them as actual people.\nBut it's not all the doing of Kohlberg. Were the Oscars coming up, I could see Simmons garnering a nomination for Best Actor. It's easily the best work he's done, and he's been in scads of things. Those of you with HBO will recognize him from Oz; you might also remember him from Juno and the Spider-Man films. The man is a gifted supporting actor. Here, he turns in an astounding, honest, and brave performance that won't leave your tear ducts dry for very long. This isn't just a three-hankie movie, it's an entire gross of Kleenex boxes. But like I alluded earlier, it's also not a soap opera that simply toys with your emotions. It's sincere and real and just magnificent."}

It's a house he's built himself, underscoring his endless independence from the rest of the world. Even at his advanced age, he chops his own wood and tends to his faithful mule, living off the land. One day, realizing that his days may be numbered, Felix heads into the local town to arrange for his funeral ceremonies. He's not able to convince the local preacher (Gerald McRaney) to hold a service for him, but Buddy (Lucas Black), a local funeral-home worker, overhears Felix and later visits the loner at his home with an offer for the funeral home to help him out.\nWe are introduced to perhaps the only person in town who really knows Felix, a widow named Maddie Darrow (Sissy Spacek), back in town after her own prolonged absence, a woman who appears to have had a past with Felix. Maddie hasn't seen Felix in, yes, about forty years. This is not a coincidence, of course. We are also shown how the rest of the townsfolk feel about Felix Bush \u2013 they each seem to have heard some kind of diabolical story about the man, that he's in league with the devil, that he's killed women and children, and so on. You know how stories propagate.\nDuvall is at the stage in his career where he's playing a lot of crusty old gents. His Felix Bush is taciturn and reticent. Is he merely not used to interacting with people, or does he have something to hide? As we learn more about him, we come to this quick conclusion: Felix Bush is no dummy. And Duvall is one of those tremendous actors who have the chops to say much while saying little, or nothing. When you look at his craggy face, you get the sense that there's more than meets the eye; just how much of what happens is something he's meant to happen is open for debate.\nHe's surrounded by a capable cast. Spacek is terrific in her meaty role as a light from Bush's past. Black is, happily enough, not just a golly-gee go-getter for the funeral home; he's smart, if not worldly. (Although few were in 1930.) And Bill Murray, who's transformed quite nicely into a dramatic actor with comedic undertones, is also a good fit as the funeral-home director who sees an opportunity for a cash infusion with Felix's big funeral.\nBest of all, when the payoff does come \u2013 in, yes, the living funeral \u2013 it's a satisfying one. We do learn Felix's big secret, and it's a powerful scene done with all the honesty and subtlety you'd want.\nGet Low was directed by first timer Aaron Schneider, who does a pretty good job of keeping a healthy pace in what looks like it'd be a slow-moving movie. Most of the scenes involve Felix himself, of course, and he's really not Mr. Excitement. Still, the movie never seems to lag; in fact, like its lead character, it seems to move quickly while not really moving much at all. This isn't a mere character study or slice-of-life feature; those can be wonderful in an arty, abstract sort of way. Felix Bush is a compelling character with an intriguing backstory, making the final scenes all the more powerful."}

It's funny, even hilarious; it has mystery and action; and it features brilliant performances by the always-reliable Paul Giamatti and Amy Ryan. It's also not a movie that wallows in treacly messages, and it's not a movie that uses sports as a crutch for \"finding one's inner strength.\" In short, it's a wonderful, top-notch movie.\nGiamatti plays Mike Flaherty, a small-time lawyer who's running low on cash. He moonlights as coach of the local high-school team, which is, to put it bluntly, terrible. In a burst of fiscal sanity, Mike offers to become legal guardian for Leo, one of his clients (played by the crusty Burt Young), who's just been declared legally incapacitated. Why? Because as his guardian, Mike gets $1500 a month. But since he wants to avoid the extra hassle of actually taking care of Leo, he puts him in a nice home. Seriously, it's a nice home, with nice people and a big flat-screen TV.\nAt this point, the movie wants us on Mike's side \u2013 sort of. He needs the cash, and he doesn't really want to tell his wife Jackie (Ryan) that they're running low, not with two young daughters to care for as well. Plus he's coach of a terrible team and is just swimming in stress. Swimming in it. So much so that while jogging to work off the stress, he suffers a panic attack.\nJust when Mike thinks some of his problems have been solved, teenage Kyle (Alex Shaffer) walks into his life. Kyle, it turns out, his Leo's grandson, and they've never met. Kyle's been sent by his mom to visit Leo. At first, this complicates things \u2013 especially when Kyle seems awfully reluctant to go back home to Ohio \u2013 but then Mike's remaining big problem is solved. It turns out the kid is a gifted wrestler. Who'd have thought that? He looks scrawny, but in practices Kyle shows he has the mettle. And thus things are riding well for Mike.\nBut this would be a truly dull (if inspirational) movie if things continued to ride well. One thing we learn early on is that Mike intentionally misled the judge in Leo's case, giving the impression that he would be actively taking care of Leo. But things really get going when Kyle's druggie mom (Melanie Lynskey) shows up to bring her boy back \u2013 and to take over as Leo's guardian.\nToo often, Giamatti has played real sad-sack characters, guys who just can't seem to catch a break, guys who suffer at the hands of fickle fate. Not so here. Mike isn't exactly a conniving mastermind, but he's not an idiot, either, and he deals with each situation with logic and reason, even as they spiral further out of his control. It's a typically masterful Giamatti performance, and for once he's not a total loser who's in over his head. He's even a half-decent coach who simply has a lackluster team to work with.\nGiamatti's not alone, though. I really got a kick out of Amy Ryan's performance as his somewhat-exasperated spouse Jackie, who's not terribly fond of suddenly having a teenage boy around at first. A few years back, Ryan turned in an Oscar-nominated performance as a native Bostonian in Gone Baby Gone. Ryan had a thick, believable Boston accent then. Here, she's playing a New Jersey native, but at no point does she go overboard with the Jersey Shore dialect. That's what good actresses can do \u2013 they can dial it back when they have to and show a little nuance.\nWin Win is not a stand-up-and-cheer movie, although the audience at the screening I attended applauded when it was over. It's not a crime drama, and it doesn't really have a lot of twists to its plot. What makes it work are all of the truly sincere, dead-on performances: by Giamatti, Ryan, Shaffer, Lynskey, Bobby Cannavale, and even Jeffrey Tambor as one of Mike's wrestling assistant coaches. Not a sour note in the bunch, everyone at the top of his or her game.\nThis might have fared well, critically, if it were released during awards season. It sort of reminded me of last year's Greenburg, starring Ben Stiller, only funnier and sweeter. Win Win is a charming, quiet movie that reminds us that, as the Grateful Dead once told us, once in a while you can get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right."}

As it was, on my hi-def 2D television, the effects were a real joy anyway. And, as it was, it turns out that the movie is a heck of a lot better than your average blockbuster kidflick \u2013 Pixar notwithstanding \u2013 that's terrific fun.\nThe aptly named hero of the story, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is a Viking. Seriously, try to imagine Jay Baruchel as a Viking warrior, and you can't. He's basically the runt of the litter, and he's always kept indoors when his remote Scandinavian village is attacked by flying dragons. Hiccup is small but not without some courage; he often sneaks outside just long enough to cause trouble for the humans. And so it goes.\nOne night he accidentally wounds a Night Fury, the kind of dragon that's so stealthy it's practically invisible, the kind that spits lasers out of its mouth instead of regular fire. The kind, in other words, that ends battles quickly. Hiccup, after some awkward moments, befriends the young dragon but keeps its existence a secret from the town, knowing they'd just as soon put it out of their misery.\nMeanwhile, young Hiccup is being trained to be a Viking along with the other of-age kids (including America Ferrara, Jonah Hill, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse), because all the manly men are out looking for the dragons' hive. Hiccup learns he has an ability to empathize with the airborne reptiles, which enables him to defeat them during his training, thus making him the toast of the town. And then, of course, his dad (Gerard Butler) returns and thinks his formerly nebbish son is now the one who will save them all.\nAt its core, this is a movie about acceptance. The humans must accept that the dragons have a perfectly good reason for raiding them; the dragons must accept that the humans aren't so terrible after all; and Hiccup's dad must accept that his son will never be seven feet tall, weigh 400 pounds, and be able to wield several double axes at once. Everyone has his part in society, and papa Stoick comes to realize that mindless violence might not be the ultimate answer. (It's a kids' movie, after all.)\nThe story is wonderfully told, but even better is the terrific animation, on par with \u2013 dare I bring them up again \u2013 Pixar. The movie is, naturally, up for Best Animated Feature this year, and it deserves to be. The voice roles are well cast, for the most part (it's easy to accept Butler as a Viking, but Baruchel's nasal whine gets a little tiresome). The action scenes are a pleasure to watch, rivaling (and even copying) Avatar, and the attention to detail looks impeccable. Interestingly enough, the end scene isn't quite what you expect. It's not a bad thing, and it's certainly not implausible. In fact, it's a heck of a lot more believable than what you'd get out of a typical animated movie. That unpredictability sort of buttresses the charming characterizations by Butler and (yes) Baruchel as father and son and earns this movie high marks."}

It also suffers from being directed by Ben Affleck, who surrounds himself here with people who can act circles around him, making him \u2013 as the central character \u2013 look really one dimensional. It's as if Carrot Top made a movie with Laurence Olivier, Michael Caine, Ralphe Fiennes, and Greta Garbo.\nAffleck plays a bank robber named Doug (ha! a thug named Doug!). A rather successful bank robber, at that. (It's noted before the titles that that the Boston neighborhood of Charlestown is notorious for turning out scads of bank robbers.) During a holdup, Affleck's masked gang temporarily takes bank manager Claire (Rebecca Hall) hostage; believing her to be a loose end who might be able to identify them, Doug trails Claire and meets cute with her, hiding his secret. Concurrently, an intrepid FBI agent \u2013 no other kind in moviedom \u2013 played by Jon Hamm is closing in.\nAmong Doug's gang is Jem (Jeremy Renner), a loose cannon who enjoys the thrill and violent nature of their escapades and who spent a nine-year hitch in prison, so you know he's tough as can be. While Doug is portrayed as thoughtful, careful, and caring, Jem is the foul-mouthed jerk who supposedly shorter on brains than Doug. Jem immediately questions the wisdom of dating their former hostage; if he had his druthers, he'd just kill Claire and be done with it. But that would go against the gang's mantra of not killing people, so Doug gets to keep seeing Claire. You know, to find out what she knows. Or if she's talked to the feds.\nThe movie asks us to believe two conflicting things about Doug: that he's amoral (he is a bank robber, after all) and yet moral (i.e., cares for Claire, cares for his buddy Jem, cares for Jem's sister Krista, cares for almost everyone. He's sort of a sensitive Clyde Barrow. Affleck's not a terrible actor, but it's tough to really buy into him in this role. He has the accent down (big surprise there), but he seems to equate speaking softly and looking pensive with a multilayered performance.\nAnother problem is Claire herself. Seems like a nice person, although she falls for Doug pretty quickly (they meet in a laundromat shortly after the robbery). And although she's pretty upset when she eventually learns the truth about Doug, she still gives him a chance. Why she would do this is anyone's guess. If they'd been together years, it still wouldn't make much sense. He's a bank robber, not Robin Hood. He's not a good guy.\nThe movie is fast paced, so these plot problems aren't really that big of a deal. By the way, while Dougie is trying to get in good with little miss Claire, he's still robbing banks, so of course you can see the standard \"this is my last job\" deal coming from a mile away. Doug's group gets its jobs from The Florist, played by Pete Postlethwait in his final role; he gives them all the intel they need, and they pull off the job. It's a working system, so why break it? I just think we'd have a little more sympathy for Doug if, say, he had to rob banks in order to pay the mortgage in a terrible economy, or he had a wife and two kids with a third on the way and his wife was dying of some lung disease, like in Brooklyn's Finest. You know, a fairly good guy forced to do bad because of circumstances. But that is not the case here. There's no reason for us to like Doug, and so he's a pretty unlikeable person. Sure, he treats Claire well. Except when he lies to her. Best line: \"I'll never lie to you again!\" That's right, trust the nice bank robber. Renner (nominated for an Oscar), Postlethwait, Hall, and even young, lovely Blake Lively (as Krista) completely outshine Affleck, making him look befuddled most of the time, as if he can just about put things together but can't quite get there.\nAnd final odd question: are there no razors in Charlestown? Everyone has three-day old growth. It doesn't make them look tough. It doesn't make them look like they've been pulling all nighters to get the job done. It just makes them look like hobos."}

As the moral center of the movie, Jennifer Lawrence's Ree Dolly isn't the type to back down, even in the face of violent backwoods discipline.\nRee's dad, the elusive Jessup, has gone astray. Again. This is a particularly bad problem now, because he had apparently just put up his house \u2013 the one in which Ree, her two younger siblings, and her nearly catatonic mother live \u2013 as collateral for a bond. His court date's coming up, so if he doesn't show the house will be seized. Ree, of course, can't let this happen; she aims to hunt her father down. He's nothing to him, not since he wandered off to make and sell meth, but without that house she, her mother, and her two youngsters will be left with nothing.\nIt's no mystery that something bad has happened to Jessup, a bad-seeming guy if there ever was one. Ree's challenge isn't just to find her father, though; it's to find her father while trying not to run afoul of the various clans in the area, many of whom don't take kindly to her poking around. And I don't mean in the almost-benign Scooby Doo or Hardy Boys way, either; these people mean business, and business happens to be cooking meth.\nOne of the greatest difficulties in acting, it would seem, is for the actor to make his or her character relatable to the average viewer. The more removed the character is from mainstream society, the tougher the role. Ree Dolly is backwoods and dirt poor. She is strong willed and physically tough. She can hunt, she can chop wood, she can do a lot of survivalist tasks just to get by. She has the burden of caring for three people. And she's all of 17 years old.\nLawrence is spellbinding as Ree, a young lady who won't take no for an answer if doing so means not only losing her home but ensuring the doom of her sister, her brother, and her mother. She isn't aggressive all of the time in her pursuit, and this measured action serves her well, for the most part. Even so, when she gets too close, the consequences aren't slight.\nThere's a little more than meets the eye to the plot. We do know that Jessup is missing. But why is he missing? His bail was paid not just from the home collateral but also by some mysterious patron \u2013 who overpaid the bail. Did someone bail Jessup out just to kill him? Whoever knows sure isn't keen on telling Ree or her dad's brother Teardrop (John Hawkes), who \"ran with\" Jessup prior to his disappearance. It's Teardrop's help that proves to be the tipping point, the missing ingredient to solving the mysteries.\nBoth Hawkes and Lawrence have been nominated for their work here (same for director Debra Granik and Anne Rosellini for their screenplay), but I thought the cinematography was amazing as well (by Michael McDonough). Stark contrasts are used; moonlight, in a key late scene, is as much a part of the scene as the actors themselves. The lighting is dark and hopeless, much like the plight of the barely living denizens of the West Virginia community. It's an arresting movie."}
< {"rating": "1", "date": "2 February 2011", "title_id": "tt1667133", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "Tries too hard to be shocking", "content": "When you're writing about an independent, low-budget movie, it's important to keep things in perspective and lower expectations. Remember that unknown filmmakers can certainly make good, even great films, but that them majority of these efforts will be highly flawed by definition. Bearing that in mind, there is essentially nothing to recommend about The Taint, a purported horror movie with an incoherent plot, rigid acting, and (sadly) despicable gore that looks like it was shot on a Fisher-Price My First Movie Camera.\nEven mainstream horror movies can be pretty simplistic in terms of story. People go into dark, isolated place and become terrorized by one or more deranged persons, masked or not. The key creativity in the most basic horror movies is in the various ways that characters meet their demise. Set the movie in a slaughterhouse, or maybe just a grocery store, then use the environment's objects to cause mayhem. But in The Taint, even this simplicity is completely derailed, with a storyline that is at times incomprehensible. And the worst part is that it just didn't need to be so.\nThe title refers to tainted water. Somehow (it's explained in the film) the water supply has been tainted so that the males who drink it become homicidal maniacs \u2013 but only toward women. Okay. It's plausible. Nothing wrong with the premise, but it's about the only not-wrong thing in the movie. Anyway, women are killed in various disgusting, gruesome ways, and I don't mean the typical Hollywood-overkill methods, either; these kills are so over the top that the guy behind Hostel thought it was too much. (Note: not really.) Heads are splattered with rocks and other objects or shotgunned, splitting the skull in twain.\nNow, like I said, perspective is everything. It would be terribly unfair to compare this movie with full-fledged studio pictures. You have a fairly inexperienced cast with a fairly low budget. Directors Drew Bolduc and Dan Nelson did do a lot with a little; the trouble is that they also did a little with a little. That is, the special effects aren't bad, and neither are the kick-ass soundtrack or the inventive opening credits. But perhaps they spent all their money on those areas and just plain didn't bother with such niceties as plot, character development, and so on. Oh, and acting lessons.\nI suppose if you must see one people-driven-crazy-by-water movie, and The Crazies isn't available, you could give this a try. But be warned. It's visceral experience. There's hardly a bodily fluid spared. There's nudity, and it's never the good kind. In fact, there are more penises in this movie than any porno version of Rent could come up with. No, it's not a sex film. And somehow that makes it worse.\nThe Taint is never a pleasant movie to watch. There isn't really anyone to root for; the main character (Bolduc) is a guy, not a girl. And he just walks around looking puzzled most of the time. The death scenes lose their novelty quickly, mostly because they lack context. There's no setup, just killing and lots of it. It's almost a domesticated version of Cannibal Apocalypse, and if you recognize that title, this might be your movie. But overall, the movie is unintentionally funny more often than scary \u2013 much more often, in fact; it's almost as if the filmmakers forgot that even the goriest movies have to have something behind the bloody mayhem to really sell the scares. You need believable characters, even if they do wind up slaughtered. Give the audience a reason to care that these people are being killed \u2013 otherwise, they're nothing more than fodder. You may as well use cardboard standees. You also need suspense, and there just isn't any in The Taint. There's just shock for the pure sake of shock, and even that wears thin pretty quickly.\nAgain, it's a low-budget movie filmed guerrilla style. It could be a cult hit, but maybe only after a hundred years or more have passed and some film scholar \"discovers\" it; then they'll have midnight mind showings (you know, direct projection into the brain \u2013 are you listening, Netflix?) and build a phenomenon. \"Look at the movies people were making in the 2000s!\" they'll say. \"Boy, how silly!\" Only they'd use updated slang.\nThe Taint is a current version of Manos: Hands of Fate or even Eegah!, two movies now known for just being terrible efforts but that have enjoyed some sort of recognition for their own ineptitude. So at least it has that potential."}

It's about a decidedly unorthodox family that's far from perfect \u2013 and what happens when a so-called interloper arrives on the scene. It's wonderfully acted, with affecting performances by Mark Ruffalo and Julianne Moore, and it's engaging entertainment, no small feat when the subject of touching charm arises.\nNic (Annette Bening) and Jules (Moore) are a married lesbian couple in California with two kids, Laser (Josh Hutcherson) and Joni (Mia Washikowska). Two two kids \u2013 one for each mom \u2013 are the result of a sperm donor, and when Joni turns 18 she places a call to the sperm bank at her brother's behest. The two wind up meeting Paul (Ruffalo) and hit it off, but when the two moms meet him, they have strikingly different reactions to his arrival.\nThere's excellent conflict afoot here. The kids resent their moms for being so defensive about their wanting to know about their own biological father; the moms resent the kids for looking into the matter themselves. X is the calm, mediating type; she's outwardly caring and splits her time between raising the two kids and starting new (doomed) businesses. By contrast, Nic is more inwardly insecure, and she compensates by controlling as much as possible of the lives of the other three. No wonder Paul's appearance causes Nic to get her back up.\nThe movie isn't one of those where increasingly wacky situations occur. It's not a slammed-door comedy. People behave as if you'd expect them to behave, which is nice thing to see in a comedy (rather than exaggeration of gestures and speech, for example). Eventually, it isn't enough that Paul shows up in everyone's lives, disrupting what little harmony they have; something else happens as a result of his appearance that really behaves as the key conflict. And for once, when the culprits are confronted, there is no neatly tied response given by the rest of the family.\nAnother pleasant aspect of the movie is that it never treats the relationship between Bening and Moore as if it were anything but the most commonplace thing on earth. It's not just that these two woman are married and in love, it's that they're also utterly human \u2013 they fight each other convincingly, they get their feelings hurt, and they reconcile with the kind of subtlety you rarely really see in movies these days. Each character, rather than being simply caricatures of what a straight person would assume a gay married couple would look like, has her own striking personality, and the two actresses perform quite well. I think Moore comes off a little better and that Bening's character sometimes seemed a little one dimensional \u2013 but this is more likely an oversight on the part of the writer, not the actress. Ironically, it was Bening who received an Oscar nomination for this movie, but I think Moore's work was superior here.\nOverall, the script neither flashy nor contrived; situations don't crop up just so we can have a laugh at someone's expense. Well done.\nThe Kids Are All Right is a genuinely funny movie. It's not a gagfest, and it wasn't meant to be one. The characters are sincere but not always forthright; they all seem to make a bad decision or two in the movie. The cast was well selected (lest I forget, Ruffalo is aces as a laid-back buttinsky, if such a thing can exist), and it's a movie worth seeing."}

It's a visceral, nasty role for anyone, let alone a 77-year-old knight of the realm. And it works, mainly because Michael Caine is in it. Without him, it's just a revenge movie aimed at the Bingo-playing set.\nCaine plays the titular Brown, a former marine who's just lost his wife after a long-running illness and his pal Leonard (David Bradley, who plays Mr. Filch in the Harry Potter films). The former was terrible enough, but the latter starts to push Brown a little over the edge. He lives in a run-down apartment complex that would be known as The Projects in America. It's never been a palatial estate, but now there are gangs and violence and plenty of drugs and drink. Harry is moved to act after simply turning a blind eye toward the mayhem and untethered anger.\nAfter Leonard's death, investigators come around to talk to Harry. The lead, Alice Frampton (Emily Mortimer) is shrewd, and she believes Harry knows more about Leonard's death than he's letting on.\nThe movie presents two conflicts. One is Harry versus his own conscience: does he go after the lowlife thugs who stabbed his friend to death? Does he use his military training to take some of them down? The other is the encroachment of crime and violence into a neighborhood that really has few options; the complex is peppered with not only more and more criminal minds but also a fair share of old timers who are just getting by to get by.\nCaine is great, for sure; not only do you feel for him in his plight, you're not put off by his rise to violence. Caine effortlessly makes us care about a man who takes extreme measures to make things right. Charles Bronson did it in Death Wish, you know. The fact that he's part of a demographic that one would least suspect of packing heat \u2013 old bastards \u2013 helps a bit, too.\nFirst-time director Daniel Barber keeps the action moving at a crisp pace, choosing not to dwell on whatever inner demons Harry is fighting. That's because, essentially, those aren't important, and dwelling on them would ruin whatever pacing had been set up. No, I think we prefer our revenge thrillers to have unsparing action \u2013 unless the movie in question is Sleuth, coincidentally also starring Caine."}

Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling play a low-budget couple slowly discovering that the love in their relationship is not only gone, it was probably never there. So sad it's\u0085 well, sad. It's just sad.\nDean (Gosling) is an artistic type, the kind who can strum a ukulele and sing slightly off key in order to impress a girl. He can draw, too; so why is he stuck working for a moving company? Meanwhile Cindy (Williams) has studied medicine and now works in a doctor's office. The couple has a young daughter named Frankie (Faith Wladyka).\nThe movie jumps back and forth in time to explain how Dean and Cindy got to where they are now: a listless marriage surviving only by attrition and inertia. We learn how they met (not cute), and we get to experience their misfortunes in an almost invasive manner. These are not perfect people, but each is endearing in his or her own way. The disintegration of their marriage seems probable even from the start, as they appear to be a bit of a mismatch. Then again, it does take all kinds, and opposites attract, and so on.\nAs the movie progresses, we also learn what each really thinks of the other.

Dean feels his wife is edging away from him, at least psychologically, perhaps regretting a long-ago decision (which we, as viewer, must see for ourselves in gut-wrenching detail).\nI know what the movie was about. I get the point. But rather than feel like something was resolved or addressed, I felt emptier than I wanted to feel. I felt, in fact, as if I had sat through two hours of tension building to an unsatisfying climax. In the end, one must ask oneself: What have we really learned about these characters? Do we know more or less than when we started? Do we care about them? I'm not sure I sincerely cared about either of them, although it seemed pretty clear that one was meant to be seen in a much more favorable light than the other.\nWilliams and Gosling are really outstanding. They had difficult, almost pedestrian material with which to work, and they made it sort of almost come together perfectly. It's not their fault that the script is so downbeat that there just seems to be no way out. In movies, it's okay to have a hopeless situation if there's at least some glimmer of hope somewhere (e.g., a terrible, crime-riddled school with one strong-willed teacher), but there has to be something. Otherwise, we're all just drifting along with the characters, and we wish they'd do something to end our torment.\nUndoubtedly, critics will rave about the deep honesty of the movie, how it expertly portrays a marriage on the rocks. And maybe it is, and maybe it does. But the sheer overwhelming depression and the endless tension, with hardly a letup of an off-kilter scene or some comic relief, doom it."}

In other words, it's virtually identical to every other boxing movie. It's distinguishable only in that the f-word is used about three times a sentence and that Amy Adams gives an improbably iron-willed performance as Mark Wahlberg's bartender girlfriend. But overall, the movie is completely forgettable.\nMicky Ward (Wahlberg) is a small-time fighter from the mean streets of Lowell, Massachusetts; his older brother Dickie Eklund (Christian Bale) is a former pro who once knocked Sugar Ray Leonard down, so naturally the elder wants the younger to succeed. Trouble is, Micky not only is beset by self doubt (he's lost three fights in a row), he also has to put up with his crackhead half brother and his overbearing, greedy mother (Melissa Leo). So, again, like most other boxing films.\nTrue to form, the movie takes us through Micky's career, first as a stepping stone for other fighters and then, gradually, to the bigger time (Las Vegas and then England). The first half of the movie contains little actual fighting in a ring, then there's a boxing montage (original!) depicting several fights in the space of a couple of minutes, all leading up to the inevitable title bout. \nFor a movie that uses so much profanity, this one was awfully dull. Hardly anything happens that isn't completely predictable. It's almost as if director David O. Russell set out to make a parody of boxing films. This movie doesn't just use clich\u00e9s indiscriminately, it robs the clich\u00e9 bank blind. \nIt's obvious to the audience from the get-go that Micky's family is holding him back (especially his crazy mother and addict brother), so it's no surprise when he makes the hard decision to move on without them - just as it's no surprise that somehow they wind up helping him, anyway. Part of what inhibits things is the fact that everyone surrounding Micky seems to be more caricature than character. Everyone's weird just to be weird, outlandish just to try to stand out. \nAnd none of it rings true, not for a second - except for Adams as Charlene. Now, if you've seen Amy Adams in anything, you'd be hard pressed to imagine her as a foul-mouthed barkeep who wears short shorts and low-cut tops. And yet here she is, and among all the hysterical, chaotic performances hers is the true standout. She brings a lot more depth to Charlene than anyone else does to their own roles. \nThe worst of the lot is the otherwise-talented Melissa Leo, who plays Alice Ward as if she were the queen of harpy shrews. Alice berates everyone with a nicotine-tinged screech designed to set your teeth on edge. She also appears to be patterned directly after Linda McMahon of the WWE (and most recently a candidate for governor of Connecticut), complete with hair color and style. It's not a favorable comparison. \nOne mistake that the movie makes concerns its identity. Is it a serious sports drama? Sometimes, yes; but other times it lapses into basic slapstick. Micky's sisters (or half sisters, I lost track) are like a coven of parrots that exist merely to be the Greek chorus of anger toward anyone they perceive as threatening their family (like, say, Charlene) or to cheerlead for Micky. When the sisters and dear ol' mom figure decide to head over to Charlene's house to scream at her, the scene quickly devolves into Keystone Kops and vaudeville. Rather than being comic relief, it's just sort of embarrassing to watch.\nAll that aside, what really underlines the inept nature of this beast is that the lead characters aren't emotionally engaging, or engaging on any level. By the end, I didn't care if Micky Ward got his title bout, as I found him spineless and stupid and merely an average (looking) boxer. I didn't care at all about his ne'er-do-well brother Dickie, even after he's sent to jail, as I found him obnoxious and dimwitted (even though he loves his bro, surprise!). I didn't care about Alice, who spends 95% of the movie cursing people out for no good reason. It's tough caring about characters when they simply don't give you any reason to. So when bad things happen to them, you're not affected.\nIt's often unfair to compare movies if they were released decades apart. But we can compare The Fighter with 2005's Cinderella Man, which was also based on a real-life fighter. Russell Crowe and director Ron Howard crafted a story that was plausible and filled with believable characters for whom you could root. It's not that Micky Ward isn't a good guy, it's that he lacks a personality. A personality would have gone a long way toward engaging the viewer. \nAnd, true to its clich\u00e9d nature, the film tries to save itself with your garden-variety title match, akin to the Championship Game in just about every baseball movie made. I'll leave it to you to decide how it ends, although the fact that the movie is based on a true story might be a clue."}

It's about a hiker, played by James Franco, who finds himself partially trapped by a rock, pinned against the wall of a crevasse. It's a stunning, visually visceral film with a couple of gut-churning scenes, but overall it is a magnificent, evocative thriller.\nFranco is Aron Ralston, a thrill seeker who loves, loves, loves the desert around Moab, Utah. And with good reason; the aerial shots give a terrific sense of just how isolated and beautiful the area is. He's hiking the Blue John Canyon when he runs into inexperienced hikers Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tamblyn), whom he cheerfully helps get back on track. It's shortly after departing from the young ladies that Aron, descending into a small fissure, slips, dislodging a medium-sized boulder, which inconveniently lands on his right arm, pinning it against the rock wall.\nThroughout Ralston's ordeal, he reexamines his life and concludes that he's in his position because of his own decisions, and not just the one in which he neglected to tell anyone of his whereabouts. \"All my life I've been heading toward this rock,\" he thinks; his new insight leads him to conclude that he's let a lot of opportunities slip by in his selfish quest to do things on his own.\nThe movie is based on a real-life occurrence, so it's probably no spoiler to learn that the young man does somehow survive his predicament. But it's not that result that makes this so captivating. Even if you've learned beforehand just how Aron is able to extricate himself, the scene is intense, grisly, and tough to watch. It's the kind of scene that makes you want to look away and ahead at the same time.\nA lot of the film's success depends on Franco himself. Like Ryan Reynolds last year in Buried, Franco is front and center; it's all about Aron, his past and present, and the lack of mobility means much must be told through Franco's expression and one-armed activities. And he's up to the task. Franco's performance here must have been physically excruciating in and of itself, as much of the cavern scenes were filmed in one sitting. But he also brings quite a bit of emotional tension to the role, and I wouldn't be surprised if he managed to get an Oscar nom out of it.\nThe film does have its flaws. One problem in mysteries and other thrillers is the pull-the-rug gambit, wherein the filmmakers make the audience think A, then switch to B, then repeat ad infinitum. After a while, the viewer isn't sure what's real and what they're supposed to think. Here, director Danny Boyle does trick you a few times; is what Aron sees a hallucination, or is it real? Aron makes quick video recordings while trapped, documenting his efforts. This adds more realism (how else would we know what he's done?) and engages the audience. It also allows us to see all sides of the young man; show-off, extrovert, implacable logician, terrified prisoner. Aron's epiphanies are so vivid that we feel as terrible as he does.\nBut there's a big upside to that realism. When the (obvious) ending does come, the result is so cathartic that it's unlikely that an average viewer could be unmoved by it. The emotional buildup during the course of the movie is justified by a denouement that just blew me away."}

The cast is flawless, the vistas are starkly realized, and the dialog sounds like I imagine people talked in the late 1800s. And although its conclusion may not really seem in doubt, it's the journey that makes the film; the attention to detail regarding the Old West is granular in nature.\nYoung Mattie Ross (newcomer Hailee Steinfeld) is a 14-year-old farm girl who's come to Fort Smith, Arkansas to collect the remains and effects of her father, who had been gunned down by one of his hired hands, Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). Mattie is in town for additional reasons, though; she aims to contract with a U.S. Marshal to bring Chaney to justice. That man turns out to be Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), a mean-spirited drunkard wearing an ominous black eyepatch. Cogburn accepts the teen's offer for the apprehension of Chaney; joining the duo is a Texas Ranger named LeBouef, played with dusty glee by Matt Damon.\nI have seen most of the Coen Brothers' films over the years and have found them to be terrific storytellers. They're filmmakers who revel in the intricacies of their movie's environment. Atmosphere, particularly in movies that are set in long-ago times in forgotten places, is crucial. Of course, we have recently seen how well the brothers can do Western pictures, with the great No Country for Old Men \u2014 but True Grit is a movie that has more of the trappings of a traditional Western, more no-good varmints, more spittin' and drinkin', more dirt.\nThe acting is astounding. Here, Bridges is more like John Wayne than I think even John Wayne was, and it would be a surprise if he didn't earn himself another Oscar nomination. Damon brings his typical panache and is also a great fit. But the real highlight is young Steinfeld herself. She's mesmerizing in her delivery, using language you'd expect out of a much-older person. And I don't mean profanity, either; Mattie is clever, logical, and focused on one goal \u2013 the arrest or death of Mr. Tom Chaney. Her perseverance is at the very solar plexus of the film. She is adamant that everything occurs on her terms, and she's smart enough to know when she's being presented with a raw deal. She's even able to negotiate a deal for her father's effects, so she can use the money to offer as a reward for Chaney's capture. Mattie is not innocent of mind; she knows full well what could happen on the trail, but she is bound and determined to see her father avenged. That's not to say that the character is simple, or even one dimensional; as single minded as Mattie is, she comes across complicated, ethical decisions during her trek and grows up a significant amount. Steinfeld is a tower of strength and a bastion of morality and kindness. And although the movie centers around her anyway, she could easily have been overshadowed by her grizzled costars; instead, she rises above them all. This could be the sign of a fine career to come. Hailee Steinfeld makes this movie and embodies the mythical true grit.\nThe violence in True Grit is brutal but never off putting. You shouldn't be disgusted, only amazed. Men are shot to death, men are stabbed. This is how the Old West was: frontier justice. Throughout the movie, there's talk about taking Chaney back to Arkansas or to Texas to answer for his various crimes before a judge. But in the back of our minds, that's not what we want to see. Like Mattie Ross, we want vengeance, we want justice, we want closure, and we want blood.\nTrue Grit has chilling moments and plenty of action, and there are also several sweet, tender moments as well. It is a glorious, old-school Western, a rare gem of a movie, one of the finest of recent vintage."}

Maybe a hobo version of The A Team. I'm not knocking it for that alone \u2013 there's plenty of other things to knock it for \u2013 but I guess what I'm saying is that if you absolutely have to watch one movie about ex-soldiers framed for a crime they didn't commit and who are now on the lam and are awesome at everything, maybe you want the devil you know instead of The Losers.\nThe Losers, named that for no particularly interesting reason, are a five-man band of good guys who get sold out while on a mission in Bolivia. Presumed dead, they aim to get back to the States, find the guy who done them wrong, and exact revenge. And giving them a hand in this noble, PG-13 endeavor is Aisha (Zoe Saldana), a butt kicker with a mysterious past \u2013 so rare in these movies \u2013 who has a score of her own to settle with The Bad Guy.\nThe Bad Guy, by the way, is named Max and is played by Jason Patric, who once upon a time had a career. Anyone see him in Rush? He was pretty cool in that. Or Narc. But now he's just another generic, oily slimeball bad guy out to rule the world. It's not important how he plans to do this. All we need to know is that he'S unhinged, like a broken door or a bad simile. Patric's Max is a psychotic jerk, which makes it easy to root against him, but really \u2013 this isn't the kind of movie that has blurred lines of Good and Bad people.\nLeading the Losers is Clay (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), the Hannibal Smith of the crew. Then there's Jensen, the computer dude, played by Chris Evans; Cougar the sharpshooter, played by a taciturn Oscar Jaenada; and Pooch (Columbus Short) and Roque (Idris Elba). Roque is sort of the Mr. T, all muscles and hot headedness. Jensen is Face. And they're all Murdock.\nA lot of things blow up in this movie, to the point where, if you see something that resembles a three-dimensional object, you know it will likely blow up. Helicopters, cars, a plane, henchmen, it's all the same, really. And, true to action-movie rules, quintillions of bullets whiz by all of our heroes, even if they stand perfectly still, and hardly any of them are hit. And when they're hit, even if they're badly hurt, they somehow can keep on firing and walking/ambling around.\nOn the plus side, each of the main actors brings a bit of personality and pizazz to his or her role, no matter how sketchily drawn it is. Everyone seems to be having a fun time, and why not? Even with all the RPGs and Uzis and whatnot, with death seemingly around every corner, these guys are all carefree, giddy as schoolboys. Jovial maiming is all the rage this year.\nAnd Saldana smolders as the Girl with Her Own Vendetta. She has one scene where she kicks the crap out of Jeffrey Dean Morgan, I suppose to establish her bona fides as a badass. But that's it as far as hand-to-hand combat goes for Aisha; she's a good shot, so she simply shoots people from then on out. Eh. I'd like to have seen more physical stuff from Saldana, but I'll takes what I can gets.\nThe Losers does have its moments, and the action scenes suffice to keep it from being a worthless rehash of better films. You could do worse. At least all of the actors are intelligible and can act a little."}

Yes, that's a backhanded compliment, but I assure you that it's completely deserved. Cop Out, from its inane title to its derivative plot, has no business being anything but a hokey hoedown of banal buddy cop dopey behavior. And yet's it's not as gut-wrenchingly awful as all that.\nCop Out stars Bruce Willis and Tracey Morgan as veteran police partners on the trail of a gangbanger (Guillermo Diaz) who loves baseball memorabilia and who just happened to steal Willis' super-valuable baseball card, the one he was going to have to sell to finance his daughter's wedding; better to do that than have his wife's new, rich husband pay for it all.\nBut that cop-movie aspect is almost irrelevant. What matters, and the only thing that really puts this one in the same general universe as the likes of, say, Lethal Weapon (in terms of approach, not overall quality), is the thrust-and-parry repartee between straight-arrow Willis (a 180 from his John McClane character/caricature) and loose-cannon, uber-hip Morgan. They're funny together, and they're given funny things to say in funny situations. That helps a lot.\nWhat's puzzling about this movie is that Kevin Smith directed it, the first of his that he didn't also write. That's puzzling because the dialog isn't really this movie's strong point. If I hadn't seen Smith's name attached to this in writing, I'd never have guessed he had had a hand in it.\nBut ultimately, it doesn't matter much, as it's just plain not terrible. You can tell I'm trying not to go overboard in my hyperbole, right? I want to present you with a level-headed, even-handed look at whether this is worth your time. And it is, with lowered expectations. It's amusing, although not for the whole family to watch."}

When Miller's squad visits location after location that the source had insisted did indeed hold such weaponry and find shelled-out, useless buildings, the office begins to ponder that something might be, you know, not entirely accurate concerning the intel and its source.\nAll of this leads to a Grand Conspiracy that kind of falls short of expectations. This is partly because this stuff happened for real \u2013 and has been extensively covered in the media, for good or ill \u2013 and partly because it's just another humdrum whodunit caper with a gritty male lead fighting all odds and bucking the system for what's right. In other words, it's a Jason Bourne movie without the amnesia.\nDamon, as usual, is good, and it always surprises me a little to see how much panache he can muster, considering his size and youthful appearance. He looks like a soldier, always has, and this makes him effective across genres. Here, he tries his level best to bring some intensity, but it just feels like much ado about nothing.\nEven so, the cinematography (by Barry Ackroyd, who was nominated for The Hurt Locker only last year) is stellar, really putting you in the thick of the action. It's interesting how Ackroyd can do similar movies like this and even use similar shots, yet it doesn't feel as if he's in a rut or is going through the motions.\nBottom line \u2013 Green Zone holds little surprise and just a modicum of suspense. Damon is appealing and well suited for the role, but he can do only so much. Ultimately, the chronological closeness of the issue and the lack of unpredictability undermine the premise."}

You should be OK with this one.", "content": "I think you need to look at the Saw movies like this: they are Friday the 13th movies with more innovation and creativity, not to mention much more sick gore. Obviously, if you didn't like any Friday the 13th, Halloween, or Nightmare on Elm Street movie, you should stop reading now, because your mind has been made up. You will hate this movie.\nIn fact, to be perfectly fair, even people who liked the earlier Saw movies will find plenty to carp about here. Saw 3D purports to be the end of the series (oh sure, but we did have several movies after Friday the 13th VII: The Final Chapter), and if it is, it ends on a fairly conclusive note. Then again, Jigsaw himself died early in the series, and that didn't stop further movies from being made, so take that for what it's worth.\nI can't review this without some plot points from previous Saw movies, so if you haven't watched any of them and plan to, stop reading. OK, still with me? Let's recap.\nMark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) is the bad guy, having served as Jigsaw's accomplice (blackmailed into it, really), and he has a new game afoot. But complicating matters is Jigsaw's widow, Jill Tuck (Betsy Russell), who knows of Hoffman's involvement. Jill brings Internal Affairs detective Gibson (Chad Donella) into the mix, so Hoffman's dual goals of running the new game and getting to Jill Tuck drive the plot.\nThe game involves a man named Bobby (Sean Patrick Flanery) who has profited mightily from having \"survived\" a Jigsaw trap; he's written a best-selling book and runs a support group and makes the talk-show rounds as well. But is Bobby on the up and up? Duh. As with all of Jigsaw's games, Bobby's games involve atoning for his own sins at the cost of some self sacrifice.\nThe traps continue to be inventive, although some \u2013 like the face trap \u2013 make welcome returns. I was reminded briefly of an old episode of the radio serial The Shadow called \"The House that Death Built,\" in which various traps (like a tripwire that triggered a double-barreled shotgun) were strewn about the house to keep people from finding treasure, or something. Bobby must go through several of these, much as victims had in earlier movies. And of course, by doing so he loses his pound or so of flesh, and secrets are revealed. Oh, and Carey Elwes, who played Dr. Gordon in the very first Saw movie, makes a return here \u2013 not giving away anything there, of course. He shows up to mock Bobby for having a support group in the first place (something about profiting off misery).\nEven though it's pretty important to have watched at least some of the earlier films, Saw 3D does its best to keep you in the loop, reminding us of certain characters and plots of previous films. For example, the support group includes bona fide survivors, such as one who needed to cut off her own arm to save herself.\nBut for me, the best part comes at the very end, when All Is Revealed. As the movie's denouement approaches and the bodies pile up, you begin to wonder if Hoffman will emerge victorious \u2013 or if he's even the only bad guy out there. The ending answers both questions to some degree of satisfaction and helps to fill in missing information from the previous six movies as well. So on the one hand, the movie ends the series in a satisfying manner, and that's good.\nOn the other hand, the door is left ever so slightly open for more and more Saw films. It's not impossible to believe. In fact, it's more plausible than the Friday the 13th \"endings,\" because no matter how many times and in how many ways Jason was killed, he somehow came back to slaughter more virgins in the next movie. At least the Saw movies follow some sort of logic.\nFor me, Saw 3D's 3D effects were well played indeed \u2013 if you don't mind intestines flying at you, you'll appreciate them. Not so much if you don't. The plot is less convoluted and intricate than some of the most recent installments, and the movie doesn't waste time on character development. Heck, you hardly even see the now-long-dead Jigsaw. The movie flat-out worked for me from a visual and visceral standpoint."}

This first-half-of-the-last-book movie is exceptional and suffers only from a weird shift in tone near the middle of the film.\nIf you have never read a Harry Potter book, this is not the movie for you to watch. Please don't watch it. You'll spend most of the movie muttering to whomever is closest, asking who these characters are and what are they doing and why are they flushing themselves down toilets (the better to get into the Ministry, my dear), and so on. Face it; you're quite the Muggle and will have no chance of comprehending this movie.\nFor the rest of you... Well, even if you haven't read the seventh (and final) book, you should be able to follow along. I'll try hard not to spoil anything for you, but some things from the earlier books may creep in, so beware.\nThe movie begins a few days before Harry's 17th birthday, and the Dudley family is leaving their home out of concern for their own safety. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is to be escorted to The Burrow and live with the Weasely family until the school year begins, but he and his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) have another plan: to find the remaining Horcruxes, objects into which the evil Lord Voldemort has spliced parts of his soul (self preservation, you see).\nFor the first time in the series, the school of Hogwarts doesn't make an appearance. Harry and his pals, under the indirect order of Albus Dumbeldore, need to find these objects before Voldemort gains any more strength; the Dark Lord, of course, is making great headway into running things anyway, what with his Death Eaters and his infiltration of the Ministry of Magic.\nAs with the rest of the books and movies, there are dual plots. There's the obvious line of the search for the remaining Horcruxes, and there's the subtle look at the way the trio is growing up, wary of their feelings for one another. One of the more remarkable aspects of J. K. Rowling's books is that she tries to accurately depict the lives of average teenagers - even if the teenagers themselves aren't average at all. So here, we see Ron and Hermione grudgingly accepting how much each means to the other, which leads to confusing and conflicting feelings on their parts as well. All normal for teenagers, and all well done.\nA word of caution, if you haven't read the book: good people die. Don't ask me who; I can't tell you. But it's the last book in the series, and there are a lot of secondary and tertiary characters - surely not all of them would be expected to make it, right? Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson have been playing their roles for almost a full decade now, and their chemistry is palpable on screen. As usual, they are surrounded by a solid British cast, including Brendan Gleeson (Mad-Eye Moody), David Thewlis (Remus Lupin), Bill Nighy (Rufus Scrimgeour), Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy), Michael Gambon (Dumbledore), and Alan Rickman (Severus Snape). Each plays his or her part with all expected prowess, but rising above all of them is Mrs. Tim Burton, Helena Bonham Carter, who plays the nefarious Bellatrix Lestrange with a maniacal glee that borders on pure insanity. Her eye alone has depth.\nHere's the only part of the entire movie that just didn't work for me. There is a long stretch in which our heroes search valiantly for the Horcruxes, and during that time there's a bit of a disagreement, causing one of them to leave the other two. Afterwards, the way the remaining two behave - in one scene - almost justifies the anger of their departed friend, thus shifting the tone a little bit. This isn't in the book at all, and I found it a bit worrisome. Why muddy the waters? It's complicated enough for the characters without more drama for the sake of drama.\nThe Deathly Hallows, by the way, are magical artifacts, and one of the big questions in the book is whether the three should search for these mythical Hallows or continue to look for the Horcruxes. Doesn't matter much, as they are all intertwined.\nEduardo Serra's cinematography is breathtaking, particularly the first battle scene after Harry leaves the Dudley's house and the battles in the forest and at stately Malfoy Manor. Serra replaced Bruno Delbonnel, who reportedly was afraid he'd begin to repeat himself. But no matter, because the film by no means has a different look or feel than the previous entries (except that the subject matter is even darker, of course).\nIf you have read the seventh book, you might wonder how this movie ends; where's a good stopping point? Again, I won't reveal that here, but when you see the movie you'll probably agree that it ends appropriately. I mean, this isn't like Back to the Future II, which was cynically used just to set up III; this is a standalone movie that's really supposed to be in conjunction with a companion movie anyway.\nAs a fan of the Harry Potter books and subsequent movies, I feel that the seventh movie is as outstanding as I expected it would be. Aside from the one strange tonal shift - which is quickly shifted back - there's really very little wrong with this movie, and most people should find it very enjoyable."}

It is the rare follow-up movie that manages to incorporate details of the earlier movie without shoehorning them in artificially. It is every bit as suspenseful as you should expect it to be.\nThe events in this film concern the sister of the protagonist, Katie, from the first film, but it's not like a retread of the same events, whereupon A New Family moves into the same haunted house and has just about the same crap happen to them. For this one, most of the events take place before those in the original - making it somewhat of a prequel - with scenes at the end overlapping some in the original as well.\nThe film begins with Kristi and Dan bringing home their newborn, Hunter, while they're visited by Katie and Micah from the first film; also in attendance is Dan's stepdaughter Alli. After the cute-kid-with-an- adoring-family scene has been set, the family suffers an odd burglary, in which nothing is taken except for an old necklace given by Katie to her sister Kristi. This prompts Dan to set up a series of security cameras.\nAs with the first film, strange things are quickly afoot - loud noises, pots falling off racks, doors closing of their own accord. The family's nanny, Martine, believes that evil spirits are to blame, and she attempts to cleanse the house. Naturally, the more pragmatic Dan doesn't buy into this mumbo jumbo, and puts a stop to her efforts. And yet the weirdness continues and even escalates.\nThe movie is shot in the same manner as in the original film; that is, using hand-held video cameras and those omnipresent security cameras to depict not only what the family is feeling but what's happening when they're not around. Many of the disturbances seem to center on Hunter, who by now is several months old. The family's German Shepherd, Abby, seems to sense that something's amiss in Hunter's room, but she's powerless to stop it.\nAs some of you may know, I have seen a few movies. In fact, I have seen a few horror movies, or at least ones that purport to be scary. Many of them aren't, and the more you see, the more jaded you become to them. In slasher pics, for example, you already know when the nubile teen is about to get hacked in half; you're more focused on the actual gore than any terrorizing. You munch your popcorn and gleefully watch blood spatter against the wall. Even suspenseful films often shoot themselves by either showing not enough suspense leading to a horrific moment - or showing way too much of it, causing the audience's mind to wander. It's all timing.\nWhat made Paranormal Activity so incredibly terrifying to me wasn't just that things happened with sudden, visceral intensity. After all, having seen the original movie, I expected these things to happen. It was that those scenes were terrifying even though I expected them. Really tough to top that. \nI won't lay out all of the HOLY CRAP scenes for you, but here's an example. Kristi is in the kitchen. It's the middle of the afternoon. No one else is home. She's sitting at the table, reading a magazine and sipping coffee - and this is after weird stuff's been happening. And then - BAM! All of the cabinet drawers and doors open, simultaneously. If you were sipping your own beverage in the theater at that time... well, you weren't anymore.\nParanormal 2 fills in some of the background surrounding its predecessor, and that's a good thing. If you recall, Katie had been experiencing weird occurrences for quite some time and even speculated that her childhood had had something to do with it. That angle is explored a little more in #2, but not to the extent where everything is solved and everyone has a happy ending.\nIn fact, that's the best part about this. The end of the first one was such a kick in the stomach, with a realistic open ending. The end of the second one is the same result achieved through different means; that is, we think we know more about why all of this is happening and has happened to these two families, but we have no clue whatsoever what the big picture is or where it's all leading. And because it's all shot using those amateur cameras, it really hits close to home. The house could be your house. Those people could be you. That could be your child and your dog.\nWatching this movie is what I imagine it would feel like to watch someone's home movies and discovering a snuff film. There's no aura of artificiality, no hint of contrived messes, nothing that would make you think that this stuff isn't actually happening to these people. The ending is not to be missed - complete, abject, unresolved, eviscerating terror."}

Stuff's gonna get blowed up. I like that. I also have an affinity for movies involving multiple Oscar-nominated actors. But too often I'm disappointed. The actors have no chemistry, and the stuff blowing up is of little consequence. But Red was different. I found it impressively exciting \u2013 a fairly straightforward plot helped along by fun, inventive effects and truly wonderful acting.\nWillis plays Frank Moses, a retired former CIA agent who happens to be falling in love with the voice of the woman (Mary-Louise Parker) who's responsible for making sure his pension checks are sent. Frank intentionally rips up his checks just so he can call back and talk to Sarah some more. Okay, that's a little weird, but innocuous enough.\nShortly after introduced to Frank and Sarah, a hit squad shows up at Franks home and basically destroys it, and thus our hero is on the run from whoever. He naturally travels to Kansas City to find Sarah, because he's pretty sure that the baddies who went after him had been monitoring his longish conversations with said bureaucratic wonk. Sarah's not exactly down with this strange man visiting her in the middle of the night and then taking her on a Grand Adventure, but since we know Frank's a good guy, we're sure she'll come around.\nTurns out, quickly enough, that someone is out to kill not only Frank but members of his old team, something about an event that occurred in Guatemala in 1981. The team, all retired, reunites to figure out what the bejeepers is going on. Frank tracks down Joe (Morgan Freeman) and Marvin (John Malkovich) and brings in Victoria (Helen Mirren), formerly of MI6. Object: break into their former place of work (CIA!) and find out what's what.\nPretty standard stuff. Will the romance between Sarah and Frank? Will the team discover a Grander Conspiracy that involves some of the highest-ranking people in American politics? Will all of the team members survive? Will we discover that the guy who's supposed to take them down (Karl Urban) isn't, in fact, the baddest bad guy? Easy to figure out. But that's not the kind of movie this is supposed to be, one that needs figuring. It's an action movie with touches of comedy and quite a bit of surprising heart.\nThe biggest asset that the movie has is its cast. It's not typical for actors who have done well by themselves in other movies to become a cohesive unit in an ensemble movie like this. Sometimes the actors try to outshine \u2013 outact \u2013 each other, as if to prove they are just that good. As a result, the movie suffers; the plot is relegated to the background, and everyone chews scenery. End of story.\nAin't so here. These guys seem like they're long-lost friends. Willis and Freeman were infamously in the terrible Bonfire of the Vanities some twenty years ago, and Malkovich and Mirren sort of worked on The Hitchhiker's Guide, but that's about it. Mirren herself is really exceptional \u2013 no surprise \u2013 as a sharpshooter with her own colorful past.\nAny movie that makes me realize how awesome even dumb movies can be is a winning movie. Red is an escapist movie. You don't watch it to see an intricate mystery; you go to see a slam-dunk, bang-up good time. And that's what you get."}

But the remake, from the guy who directed one of the non-Spielberg Jurassic Parks, is so straightforward as to lose most of its menace. It's a flat, almost expressionless rendition of a classic movie monster, and it's a darn shame. Del Toro plays Lawrence Talbot, an American returning to his ancestral home in Blackmoor, England, where he finds that the old mansion looks like it was bombed and is inhabited by just his father (Anthony Hopkins) and a few servants. His brother has been brutally murdered, leaving a widow (Emily Blunt) who implores Lawrence to look into matters more closely, as everyone in the village seems to think a beast or a bear or something did it.\nThe movie follows the legendary 1941 movie's script fairly closely, and that may be the problem: there's just not a lot new about this version. The atmosphere's the same, the scenes are virtually the same, and so it lacks that sense of newness that original movies have. Now, of course, it's a remake, so it shouldn't be a reinvention of the story, but it might have been better served as a slight reimagining. Instead, what we get is largely familiar territory, so much so that Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay explicitly includes Jack the Ripper as part of the Wolf Man's universe; Talbot and his family are investigated by none other than Inspector Abbeline, well played here by Hugo Weaving and played in the Ripper film From Hell by Johnny Depp. Abberline's appearance, rather than that of a generic inspector type, is an attempt to add even more to the spooky turn-of-the-century-Britain atmosphere, and it just feels like a stretch instead of an enriching detail.\nThe entire cast is effective, particularly Blunt as the only one who can (predictably) save Lawrence Talbot from himself and his family's curse. Blunt's work here is better than you might expect for the role. She's pretty and has a strong screen presence, which is more than you can say for your average ing\u00e9nue. Del Toro, too, is much better than you'd expect him to be, as well; he's always been a pretty good actor, certainly (Traffic, The Usual Suspects), but he's more evocative here than usual. And Anthony Hopkins is Anthony Hopkins, although he does occasionally lapse into uncharacteristic hamminess.\nHere are two caveats. For one thing, Del Toro doesn't become the monster until well, well into the film. You don't get to see any monster until the movie's well underway, and what's the point of that? It's not terribly scary without there being a monster. Secondly, and this is weird, but the makeup for Wolfie himself looks a little artificial. That's weird because it was concocted by none other than the well regarded Rick Baker. It's 2010, and the effect of man changing into beast looked straight out of An American Werewolf in London.\nBottom line: The Wolfman is not a bad film; it's just not particularly memorable, more of a footnote to otherwise well-remembered careers, except for the director's."}

That's a little disappointing, considering that David Fincher (Seven, Zodiac, Fight Club) is the director, but the movie isn't much more than a run-of-the-mill history movie about a subject matter \u2013 websites \u2013 that's not particularly compelling.\nIn 2003, Harvard undergrad Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg, Zombieland) creates a quickie site called Facemash, which takes head shots of female coeds and puts them side by side, allowing male users to rate which one is more attractive. This crashes the Harvard network and brings him to the attention of one of the many posh elite clubs on campus, whose leaders (the Winklevoss twins) ask Mark to create a social networking site for them, but open only to Harvard students.\nThis in turn leads Mark to create Facebook itself, rather than the Harvard-oriented site. It also sets off a chain of events that would eventually make Mark a billionaire, albeit one sued by not only the twins but by his own best friend, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), the company's CFO.\nThe movie's how-it-all-came-together theme is interspersed with legal proceedings \u2013 both sets \u2013 that put everything into a sort of current context. What caused Eduardo and Mark to be at odds? Do the twins have a chance of defeating Mark? And how does Sean Parker of Napster (Justin Timberlake) fit into all of this?\nMore than 500 million people use Facebook presently. It's no longer a haven limited to college students. My mom's on it. If my grandparents were alive, they'd be on it as well. It's a hugely successful tool in so many ways \u2013 small businesses can use it to keep in touch with their customers, friends can find their friends anywhere in the world, people can catch up with old classmates, and so on. It's highly intuitive and very user friendly, and it's all free.\nMaking a movie about a website can't be easy. A website isn't three dimensional; it's not exhilarating to watch someone create one. The Social Network is simply not an exciting movie, although it tries really hard to be one. It attempts to show that the intrigue and back stabbing that occurred behind the scenes of its rapid rise into the zeitgeist is riveting, fascinating stuff. But when the movie was over, I didn't know much more about Mark Zuckerberg than I did going in to the theater, and what I learned about Facebook itself was just trivia.\nOn top of that, the legal stuff that's always in the background is just dull, no matter how many snide answers Zuckerberg gives to opposing counsel. We're not talking about the Scopes monkey trial here.\nOn the plus side, we do get a terrific performance from Eisenberg, who shows he's not just another schlubby always-a-victim actor; the role has some real heft to it, and he's amazingly up to the challenge, particularly with the rapid patter that always seems to be coming from Zuckerberg's mouth.\nOther than that, though, this is almost a generic origin story about a subject that's really not interesting enough to warrant a full-length movie."}

And Ryan Reynolds, as the American citizen-contractor who finds himself in his sandy predicament, is galvanizing in a role that requires a heck of a lot of pure acting skills - no playing off other characters and no leaning on elaborate sets.\nPaul Conroy (Reynolds) awakes inside a pine box. After a few - of many - panicky moments, Paul discovers two weapons in his arsenal: a Zippo lighter and a cell phone (not his). Naturally, he makes several calls, but most of them wind up going to voice mail or, in multiple cases, clueless drones who don't really believe his situation.\nMaking a movie like this is probably no picnic for anyone involved, least of all Reynolds, stunt double or not. Even if the coffin in which he's encased were completely open on the top, with camera trickery cleverly belieing its volume, he's still scrunched in an awkward, terribly uncomfortable position for the bulk of the film.\nIt's easy to appreciate movies in which the director has so little to work with. Reynolds is the only person we seen on screen, although his character communicates with functionaries and loved ones via the cell phone. The coffin itself is (mostly) empty. There are sound effects, but no CGI. It is a paragon of minimalist filmmaking.\nWhat makes this movie work above all else is the abject terror it instills in you. When Conroy's flame goes out and he begins scraping about in the darkness, you feel as if the walls of the theater are closing in around you. His breathing becomes your breathing, and your heart beats with his. Every bead of sweat and drop of Paul Conroy's blood is viewed close-up and personal. And, as with some of the best films, you feel you are watching reality unfold, rather than a staged morality play.\nReynolds is really terrific. He's been saddled with high-flying superhero movies, like the Blade and X-Men films, and stupid chick flicks, like The Proposal. Turns out he's excellent when given a really challenging role. Because of his efforts and those of the screenwriter (Chris Sparling), Buried is excruciating and effective, playing with its audiences' emotions with simple measures of stark reality. To be sure, this is no maudlin melodrama about man's slow demise, and neither is it an overboard look at US activities in Iraq. It is merely what it pretends to be: a movie about a man caught in a trap not of his own device. \nNothing that happens to Paul in this movie seems implausible. Nothing seems contrived simply to move the plot along. Sparling doesn't need to stoop to such nonsense, because being trapped in a box underground is horrifying enough for anyone. Even when, at one point, an X factor is introduced, an explanation for its arrival is quickly at hand - and it, too, makes perfect sense.\nBuried is a tough movie to watch at times, but it's so impeccably directed, written, and acted that it's well worth the discomfort. It's exciting, and best of all, the conclusion is in doubt right up to the very last seconds. Certainly recommended to fans of thrillers, particularly of the psychological nature."}

Night Shyamalan gets, the better the movie nowadays. That said, Devil doesn't show you much that you haven't already seen somewhere else (and better), and its twist is fairly obvious. To its credit, it does make good use of a claustrophobic setting and keeps the suspense level fairly high up toward the end.\nFive people get into an elevator in a Philadelphia high rise. Somewhere during its ascent, the elevator car suddenly stops, stuck in transit. That's tense enough stuff as it is, but when the lights flicker, one of the passengers (Bojana Novakovic) has been cut in the back. Soon everyone's pointing fingers at the obnoxious mattress salesman (Geoffrey Arend) and, eventually, at each other.\nMeanwhile, the building's security guys - led by Matt Craven - are trying to figure out why the car has stopped, as it appears to be in fine working order and isn't currently being inspected. But once they see the blood on the Young Woman's back, the police, in the form of Detective Bowden (Chris Messina), who's still grieving over the hit-and-run loss of his wife and kid. (This is not unimportant.) \nDevilsort of plays out like a scary version of And Then There Were Young, because as time passes - and we never know how much time does elapse - bodies pile up in that confined space. So who is the murderer? Or is it, I don't know, THE DEVIL HIS OWN DANG SELF? (Hint: maybe?) And I honestly don't think this is giving anything important away, but certainly the elevator car's passengers are not what they seem. (Or are they? Aha, see what I did there?) \nThe movie's really two stories: Detective Bowden trying desperately to find out more about who's in the elevator - and who's the bad guy - and the interactions among those trapped inside. A security camera shows all the action in the elevator, but audio runs only one way, so Bowden can yell at them for touching the dead body, but they can't tell him what's going on. That does make for tense moments, and it's completely believable - after all, why would an elevator have a two-way audio system? \nSo partway through this movie, I decided on my killer. I turned out to be right, although it looked like I was going to be wrong. When you have a limited number of characters and your movie's title is Devil, the possibilities aren't exactly endless. So director John Erick Dowdle (Quarantine and the little-seen The Poughkeepsie Tapes, which I want to see although it isn't on video yet) is pigeonholed with his setting and his plot. He can't introduce too many outside elements, because those would be seen as MacGuffins. So he's stuck with what he has. And I think he did as well as could be expected. But there were far too many scenes in which the screen is quite literally black, with audio explaining what's happening. Then the lights come back on and Something Has Happened. The first time, it was intriguing, but eventually it was just a crutch. A believable one, but still it felt contrived.\nShyamalan produced, and he wrote the story on which the movie is based (Brian Nelson wrote the screenplay). Compared with recent Shyamalan-directed movies, this one is an epic masterpiece. Maybe he's simply better suited to producing at this point. That said, as I mentioned before, the twist isn't really all that surprising. Much like Shyamalan's most recent movies.\nDevil has its scary moments, but overall the effect is muted by the predictable, pedestrian plot. Even if you're not a connoisseur of the kind of movie that makes your heart alternately stop and leap from your chest, you'll recognize the well-worn story and waste your time trying to pick out the villain. That said, the genre has produced far worse, and there's just enough tension for this to be a moderate success."}

Robert Rodriguez's remarkable, well-crafted revenge thriller gives you really everything you'd want to see in an ultraviolent genre movie, complete with guns, knives, profanity, nudity, explosions, and a girl in nothing but a nun's habit. It's the ultimate low-budget exploitation film done on a large budget.\nDanny Trejo, perhaps the baddest bad-ass in all of Hollywood - the man's done time for armed robbery, for goodness sake - plays the title character, an ex-Federale who watched his wife and daughter murdered before him by a corrupt cop. Now working as a day laborer in modern-day Texas, Machete is approached by a slick dude in a BMW, played by Jeff Fahey, who offers the - shall we say - interesting-looking Machete a boatload of money if he'll partake in a little assassination: the killing of a senator (Robert DeNiro) who's running for reelection on a platform of immigration, specifically illegals and the huge electrified fence he wants to erect to keep them out.\nThis is obviously a very big issue in the U.S. right now, so the timing of the movie's release couldn't be more appropriate. But Rodriguez doesn't waste time trying to explain one side or the other of the story - such as with, say, Crossing Over - and instead puts the immigration issue in the background to the machismo and lone-wolf crusade of Machete.\nThe film is peppered with familiar names. Jessica Alba plays an ICE agent (of course she does) who's worked her way up the ladder to Special Agent and who (of course) is of Latina descent. Steven Seagal is a drug lord, and it's his finest work. (Yes, I realize that's not saying much, but I think this was a role he was born to play.) Michelle Rodriguez is a legal Mexican who sells food from a cart and may or may not be part of an underground revolutionary network. Cheech Marin plays a priest, a brother to Machete; Lindsey Lohan plays Fahey's daughter. And like Rodriguez's other movies, each of these known quantities is there not for star power or recognition but because they fill a role. That's damn good casting. In fact, let's lay it out this way: Lohan, who will never be confused with Grace Kelly, is dead on as the nymphette, kinky daughter. She gets a lot of flak for her offscreen antics, but she nails this role perfectly. The fact that she gets naked helps a lot, too.\nFrom the very first scene, we know we're in for an atypical action movie. It's the scene in which Machete is betrayed and his family slaughtered before his very eyes. There's blood spattered on the walls, there is full-on nudity, and there's a classic villain setup.\nMachete the movie is certainly not meant to be taken seriously. We must suspend disbelief for pretty much the entire picture. Rodriguez's eye for detail and sense of unpredictability lend even more panache to a movie that already has Danny Trejo. Machete is stylish, gritty, vivid, and absolutely galvanizing. The end may never be in real doubt, but the sheer spectacle of Machete taking on bad guys and good guys and good guys who are really bad guys is a true wonder to behold. Robert Rodriguez is no mere action director; he's a true auteur of the genre. Violence exists in this movie not simply to show destruction, and nudity isn't there simply for the sake of debauchery. Everything serves a purpose, sometimes to lull us into a comfort level of acceptable - if implausible - movie deaths, sometimes to shock the living hell out of us. The director does not rely merely on the standard action-movie tropes, intertwining inventive effects with sincere plot turns. A lesser director might simply blow junk up and call it a day, using those effects to mask an imperfect script, but Rodriguez here uses that imperfect script - an homage to the exploitation pics of the 1970s - to buttress the effects, make them even more involving and spectacular."}

Galvanized by an Oscar-winning performance by Jeff Bridges as Bad Blake, the world-weary crooner who's seen better days, the movie is a few notches above the standard rags-to-riches story (particularly because there are hardly any riches), with a finale that's both understandable and unpredictable. Jeff Bridges is a crusty, cranky old drunk here, sort of exactly like the broken-down piece of meat that Mickey Rourke was in The Wrestler. And like Randy the Ram, Bad Blake has a run-in with a younger woman; in this case, she's younger than Marisa Tomei was to Rourke. She's Jean Craddock, a local newspaper reporter, played by the always effervescent Maggie Gyllenhaal (who's terrific here). Like Tomei's character, Craddock has a kid and has weathered tough relationships. (It's set in the Southwest, where movie womenfolk seem to make multiple bad relationship decisions.) Jean falls for the oddly endearing Bad, and a long-distance relationship is born.\nBridges is one of those actors who seems just plain awesome in everything. I mean, the man's fun to watch, whether he's The Dude, The President, the bad guy in The Vanishing, a lounge singer, even a comic- book villain. His effortless charisma carries even the most lightweight of movies, and perhaps that's something that's worked against him over the course of his career. Crazy Heart was his fifth nomination and his first win, so it's not as if he's never been recognized, but because he's so good at disappearing into roles and because he takes the crap movies along with the meaty ones, maybe Hollywood's been taking him for granted. Oh, but not now. Bridges' Bad Blake is both unbelievably strong and weak, a man beholden to the bottle but desperate for love. Against his better instincts, honed over a very long middling career, he falls for Jean and her little boy in return.\nThe movie could have taken a few shortcuts and called it a day, and it didn't, and for that it deserves a lot of respect. Colin Farrell plays a singer who got his start from Blake years ago and is trying to repay the favor. A lesser movie might show Blake all bitter about the younger man's success, but it's not so here. A lesser movie might also show anger and resentment from ol' Bad Blake, just trying to keep on keepin' on, only to culminate in a not-at-all-shocking concert that somehow saves his career, but this one doesn't do that, either.\nI think one of my favorite aspects, though, is how well the two leads played off each other. Maggie Gyllenhaal is 33 years old, and Bridges is 61, but you'd never know it watching the two of them together. Oh, sure, he does present as an older man, but not almost 30 years older. Their connection is palpably strong and a wonder to behold.\nIt also helps a lot that the songs \u2013 some performed by Bridges and Farrell themselves \u2013 are real toe-tappers, excellent \u2013 pardon the pun \u2013 stage setters. Whether Blake's playing in a bowling alley or before 12,000 fans as an opening act, he and his tunes are genuine country, solid American entertainment.\nBlake, like Rourke's Ram, is not an entirely sympathetic man; he's not even a man who's made bad decisions in the past and suddenly begins to make good ones. He's a good man, yes, but trapped by a device of his own design. It's not even a certainty, over the course of the movie, whether he will come out on top in the end \u2013 or whether he deserves to. And that's a testament to both Bridges' tremendous, career-defining work and to a top-notch script by director Scott Cooper, who adapted Thomas Cobb's novel."}

Harrison Ford gives one of his best (nonaction) performances in years, and even Brendan Fraser is palatable. It's definitely a three-hankie movie, so it's sort of a chick flick. Fellas, you should watch this at home, alone, with the curtains pulled.\nJohn (Fraser) and Aileen (Keri Russell) Crowley have two young children with a rare disease called Pompe that damages muscle and nerve cells in the body. Both children are wheelchair bound but in generally high spirits, thanks to wonderful, supporting parents. (They have a third child who does not have the disease.) Time is running out on the kids, though, because Pompe victims typically do not live to double-digit ages. In desperation, Crowley turns to researcher Robert Stonehill (Ford), a cranky, iconoclastic scientist who cares only about his work and, sometimes, fishing. Stonehill has a remarkable new theory for the treatment of Pompe, but he's never tested it on anything, let alone anyone; his field is in theoretical, rather than applied, research. But the persistent Crowley wears him down, and - long story short - agrees to form a partnership with him, a foundation dedicated to finding a cure for the disease, a foundation to which moneyed people can donate funds.\nWhat makes this particular film work isn't that there's a race against time or even that there are adorable kids who are basically at death's door. No, it's because director Tom Vaughan chooses to have Crowley's daughter Megan (Meredith Droeger) act as the face of the disease, and she's a charming, happy child. Her personality is so magnetic that you could easily forget she was riddled with the debilitating disease, were it not for the wheelchair.\nVaughan doesn't waste his time playing on the audience's sympathies in abundance. He focuses on the machinations that Crowley and Stonehill have to undergo to fund, research, and bring to market this miracle cure - actions that are either in praise or an indictment of the real-life politicking needed to get medicine to drugstores. Crowley and Stonehill form a company, which they sell for funding, and then the funders want to make more money and so are bloodless beasts (maybe not), and all the while the two Crowley kids are slowly getting a little worse.\nThe movie manages to be sentimental and touching without even a hint of cloying insincerity, and that's a remarkable achievement nowadays. I mean, think about it. Even people who don't watch a lot of movies have become jaded to story lines that we just know are trying to manipulate us one way or another. We know we're being played, and we don't really care, and when that manipulation is too obvious, we just turn to something else for our entertainment fix. But we're not really being manipulated here at all. The film honestly, and not melodramatically, presents us with a real-life crisis that has distinctly and believably human element to it; without it, we may as well be discussing an Olympic hopeful's chances at the gold after learning she has contracted vasculitis.\nFord is terrific. The man can do drama. It's worth noting that this is the film since Return of the Jedi in which Ford was billed somewhere other than first. It's true, he's almost 70 years old, but the guy still has charisma to burn. Whether he's doing a slow burn or raging at the elementally specious bureaucracy surrounding him, he is nothing short of believable. He's so good that you forget he was Han Solo or Jack Ryan or Indiana Jones and think that, for a short while, he's Dr. Stonehill.\nNow, admittedly, this isn't a movie for everyone. And even though it's not overtly manipulative, it's still a tugger of heartstrings. So be warned. It's tough not to be affected by it, a sure sign of a well-made movie."}

It's strictly by the numbers and doesn't even have the promise of strong individual performances (Sam Neill, Ethan Hawke, and Willem Dafoe) to serve as a selling point. It's as drab and lifeless as the bloodsuckers contained therein.\nIt's the future - of course - and a plague has changed most of the human race into vampires; now there's only about 5% of the human population remaining, and the vampires - who vant to suck their blud - are getting antsy. Hawke plays a hematologist who's been working on a replacement blood supply, something artificial that'll have all the kick of regular human blood but that can be created without he help of humans. His boss, played by Sam Neill, understands the importance of getting a stable food supply but seems to have ulterior motives. So it's a plot lifted right out of Blade II, which also wasn't very good.\nThings heat up when Hawke stumbles upon some humans who are on the run from the rest of the world and who - of course - desperately need use of his blood-studying skills to find a cure for vampirism. This doesn't sit well with Neill or with Hawke's soldier-brother, the former of whom has no intention of solving this worldwide malady and the latter of whom hunts humans for a living. You can kind of see where this is headed.\nThe humans are led by Dafoe and Aussie Claudia Karvan, who looks like a younger Catherine Keener (a compliment). They have the crossbows, and Dafoe has no heartbeat (much like the movie). Know why? Because he was a vampire and got cured! And now Hawke can try to repeat that miracle and cure all those sad, mopey vampires! It's a win win win situation! Brothers Michael and Peter Spierig, with their first big-budget film, aren't able to make this journey any more memorable than similarly themed movies, such as the aforementioned Blade. There's little mystery and intrigue, which is fine if there's also a lot of butt kicking. But there isn't. There's a lot of gloom, a lot of gray covering everything, and a real sense of seedy despair; it's as if the movie were filmed in a low-budget motel. It's the Econo Lodge of vampire movies. There's no real twist, and the action is so low key that you're not distracted from how straightforward and uninspiring the plot itself is."}

It's well staged (no pun intended) and choreographed, and it doesn't feel claustrophobic, as so many movies adapted from plays do.\nGuido Contini (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a legendary film director whose most recent movies have been flops, and he's in the middle of a crisis on his latest, titled Italia: he has no script and no idea on how to proceed.\nAs he struggles to keep the movie afloat - and while production begins - Guido must also juggle the affections and attentions of the various women in his life, from his mother (Sophia Loren) to his lover (Penelope Cruz) to his wife (Marion Cotillard) to his muse/leading lady (Nicole Kidman) to a reporter (Kate Hudson) to a long-ago crush (Stacey Ferguson) to his confidant (Dame Judi Dench). The plot carries us from woman to woman, one sensational musical number after the other. Director Rob Marshall, who also directed the Oscar-winning Chicago in 2002, does a magnificent job of interspersing the songs with the actual storyline.\nNow, I'm really not much of a fan of musicals - really! - but there's so much to love about this one. Each actress performs her own numbers and is so spellbinding that you'd almost think they were musically talented and not just pretty faces. Okay, granted, you wouldn't think that anyway, not with all those Oscar winners up there. But seriously, would you believe Cruz, Kidman, or Dench could or would sing? Not I. Not I! Cruz, who earned an Oscar nomination for her work here as the aggrieved mistress, is simply stunning, with the full-bodied passion and angst one would expect from a woman who wants especially what she cannot have. To say that Cruz is beautiful is to state the obvious, but here she is incandescent.\nOddly enough, the movie didn't really do all that well at the box office (although it did receive several Oscar nominations), despite that tremendous cast. I think it might be because when all is said and done, one might wonder what all the singing and dancing was all about: what was the point, anyway? Essentially, it is a way for Contini to regain his creativity and get moving on his film, by examining the effect that his various relationships have had on him. If you can accept that this isn't meant to be a linear plot like Chicago (i.e., murderess gets her due), it's a lot easier to swallow the film itself.\nAnd amid all of the flash and glamour of the musical numbers is another treasure of a performance from Day-Lewis, who seemingly doesn't know how to be a bad actor. His conflicted, desperate Contini is both dislikable and vulnerable, an enigma whose multifaceted life is symbolized by his two-toned career.\nFun fact: the title refers to the nine films of Federico Fellini, who directed the immortal 8 1/2 (1963). It's also the age of the young Contini in a flashback number.\nAs I mentioned, musicals aren't really my thing, but when they're done well, it's hard not to acknowledge their awesomeness. And Nine is about as awesome a musical as you get. A perfect cast sells each number with gusto and sheer talent, not to mention no small amount of beauty and panache."}

But it's much more than that; it's a look at how the survivors of the September 11 attacks continued with their lives, post-tragedy, and it's about man's powers of self redemption. It's a character study in the guise of a film noir mystery.\nJohn Rosow, played by Michael Shannon, is contacted by a mysterious client to follow a man from Chicago to LA, find out what he's up to, and then bring him home to New York. But Rosow's investigation unearths more than a simple retrieval mission, and ultimately it reveals a heck of a lot about him and his past, particularly in how he has dealt with losing his wife during the 9/11 attacks.\nBecause, you see - and you will, early on, no spoiler here - the missing person is one of the many who simply were never heard from again after the attacks on the Twin Towers. Many of those people were (and are) presumed dead, but some may have behaved like Harold Fullmer (Frank Wood) and moved elsewhere to get on with their lives anew. Harold's up to something, but luckily for us it's not something nefarious (that would have been too obvious, certainly), and soon Rosow is faced with a moral quandary - should he let Harold stay where he is, or is he obligated to bring him back east? Shannon is superb, a craggy, world-weary Johnny Law who's been leaning on the drink for far too long. We've seen these oversoaked cops before, the ones who are either cold-shocked by tragedy or just numbed to everyday horrors. But below the seen-it-all surface, Rosow has plenty of issues, plenty of bad memories, and plenty of guilt.\nThus there are dovetailing plots - the apprehension of Fullmer and the redemption of Rosow. Writer Noah Buschel, who also directed, has crafted a rich, crusty mystery thriller into a psychological study of the long-term effects of a truly horrific day in American history, particularly on individuals; in this case, one man flees his memories, while the other embraces them nightly.\nI wanted to mention this movie in particular, because it's certainly not one that most people have heard of (it's now on DVD). It's a quiet, subtle look at an event that was itself nothing but. It's well written and insightful into the psyche of a survivor, and it includes a commanding performance by Shannon (nominated for an Oscar for Revolutionary Road, overshadowing both Kate Winslet and the overacting of Leonardo Dicaprio) along with strong support from Amy Ryan (Gone Baby Gone)."}

It has a lot of pulse-quickening action, astounding stunt work, and a semiplausible plot. Oh, and someone named Angelina Jolie to do all the requisite butt-kicking.\nThere have been plenty of psychological thrillers in which the protagonist is double crossed, then triple crossed, and so on until the audience quite literally has no idea who's on what side or who's doing what to whom - it's sort of an entertainment by obfuscation. Sleight of hand. It's when the director tries hard to confuse the bejeezus out of everyone, the better to disguise a thin plot and cardboard acting.\nBut that isn't true here. Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a CIA analyst who's accused - from the get-go - of being a sleeper spy, by a Russian attempting to defect. Naturally, our gal Evelyn bolts the CIA and goes on the run. But unlike other movies, where the balance of the plot would be devoted to her finding the Real Bad Guys and Righting Wrongs and Clearing Her Name, this film keeps us guessing: Is Salt really a preprogrammed spy with the goal of assassinating the visiting Russian president? Her CIA boss (Liev Shrieber) and the head of counterintelligence (Chiwetel Ejiofor) dash off to New York to catch her, and she eludes them at every step. And all the while, we're not sure if she's a good guy or a bad guy, or a good guy with bad intentions, or perhaps a good guy with a shady past.\nAnd although the ending isn't neat and tidy, it's also not implausible, another hallmark of run-of-the-mill spy thrillers. It's refreshing.\nAngelina Jolie has shown time and time again that she supersedes all of those preconceived ideas of pretty actresses. She's beautiful, yes, but she's also a very gifted actress. It's in full evidence here, as her Salt dons numerous disguises that really do a good job of hiding her amazing looks. Lesser actresses would wilt under the pressure of, you know, actually performing as opposed to being gawked at, but Jolie flourishes. And she has some serious action-movie chops, too! Apparently, she did her own stunts, and she's simply electrifying. It's easy to believe that her role was originally written for a male lead - what in Hollywood isn't? - but it's hard to imagine many top-shelf actors doing as much with the role as Jolie does here. As with the best actors, Jolie can do a lot with the slightest bit of movement or expression. She is mesmerizing and tremendous.\nShe's ably supported by Shrieber and Ejiofor, and although neither character is particularly fleshed out, neither, too, is obvious and shallow. So, good script from Kurt Wimmer.\nOh, sure, there's a spot midway through the movie where you begin to consider the possibilities of what Salt's up to, where the script's headed, and you figure out what the big twist at the end is going to be. Or maybe I just got lucky. Probably the biggest obstacle that writers of psychological thrillers face is the plot corner, where they've made things so intricate that they can't write themselves out of their own traps. Here, there are only a few possible outcomes, so it's not too tough to figure out what will eventually happen - the trick is that Noyce and Wimmer make getting to that eventuality a rough, perilous journey.\nAll in all, Salt is the kind of movie that, say, Eagle Eye or Repo Men or State of Play or even Knight and Day wish they were. It's expertly directed by Noyce, who also has given us Patriot Games and the overlooked Rabbit Proof Fence and features a powerful performance by Angelina Jolie. Oh, and in case there was any doubt, it's sequel-ready."}

It's crippled by overexplaining itself and by changing the rules it sets out for itself when convenient to the plot. Still, a strong supporting cast (behind the vapid Leonardo Dicaprio) helps considerably.\nDicaprio plays Cobb, a man whose job it is to invade people's dreams and steal their secrets. (It stands to reason that he's also The Very Best at this.) Cobb operates outside of the United States because of a terrible incident in his past, and he's been looking for a way back without facing any negative consequences. A Mr. Saito (Ken Watanabe) has a job for him, with a proposal: if Cobb is successful, Saito will have his longstanding charges dropped with the proverbial one phone call. But, of course, there's a catch: rather than having Cobb steal an idea from their victim, Saito wants him to plant one, an act known as \"inception,\" an act that is deemed nigh near impossible to accomplish.\nCobb assembles his team: his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the architect Ariadne (Ellen Page), the forger Eames (Tom Hardy), the chemist Yusuf (Dileep Rao). Their mission: enter the dream of the heir of a major corporation and plant the idea that he wants to strike out on his own rather than take over the company when his nearly dead dad kicks the bucket.\nAs with most Christopher Nolan movies, this one takes some careful scrutiny. It's not that the plot is convoluted, precisely, it's more that there's not only a lot of things going on in rapid-fire motion, and the entire movie is set against the backdrop of an area that virtually no one knows anything about: dreams. Because of the unfamiliar territory, the filmmakers can do almost anything they want within the movie, within the dream within the movie, and within the dreams within the dream, and so on.\nNolan establishes some rules from the start, because his audience naturally would have no idea what they might be (for example, if you die in a dream, you wake up; in order to come out before the dream is up without dying, you need to fall somehow). Then, over the next couple of hours, he violates those rules a few times. In other words, the rules are X, but because of this situation in which we now find ourselves, all bets are off. It's kind of easy to write your way out of plot predicaments when you can change the rules at any time and for any reason.\nThis is an issue that plagued Dicaprio's last movie, Shutter Island, a movie that depended on the audience being able to suspend disbelief. That's crucial here as well, but the nature of what we're supposed to disbelieve keeps changing. It's tough to completely respect a movie that needs to move its own goalposts.\nThe cast isn't terrible, but it's largely lost under a sea of story intricacies, wild CGI, and a lot of blaring music. This is a minor complaint, honestly, but there were multiple scenes in which characters were speaking to one another in normal tones while the movie's soundtrack was ratcheted up to 11, thus rendering the dialog completely indecipherable. For a movie that's so highly dependent on plot, this was irritating and really inexcusable.\nBut back to the cast. Both Gordon-Levitt and Page seemed out of place, in way over their heads. Gordon-Levitt's character probably should have been played by someone more skillful, like Mark Ruffalo or James Franco; Page looked like she just wandered onto the set of another of her Comcast commercials, and she's not yet been able to shed her Juno MacGuff persona. Page, like the rest of the cast, is game but is ultimately along for the ride, nothing more. Also on hand is Marion Cotillard as Cobb's dead wife who appears to him in dreams as sort of a projection, and that's where the weirdness begins; he's defensively locked his memory of her in his subconscious, so of course she pops up every time he goes into someone else's dream. That can be a bit of a drag.\nI'm still firmly in the camp that believes Leonardo Dicaprio often confuses earnestness with good acting. (I might be the only person in this camp, but the smores are to die for.) I know there are plenty of people who think he's the bee's knees when it comes to passionate performances, but I just feel like he's stretching further than he can reach as an actor. He seems sincere here, yes, but not entirely believable in the role. For some reason, I think a more burned-out- looking actor would have been better, even Jeff Bridges \u2013 despite the age difference \u2013 because he would lend a lot of gravitas to a pretty demanding role.\nAs always, I was amazed and impressed by the imagination of Christopher Nolan (who also scripted), but I was largely disappointed by the movie, particularly its denouement. There's much to see and soak in, and it's true that overthinking the movie will lead you to really dislike it (or stare at it, mouth agape), but often it's just too much seriousness and not enough awe and wonder."}

Knight and Day, starring Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz, features the lesser of two evils - faint praise - but turns out to be really a lot of fun, hearkening back to Cruise's action-movie days, and is much more entertaining than you might expect from a movie with two annoying actors in it.\nCruise plays Roy Miller, a spy-or-maybe-not who accidentally on purpose ropes June Havens (Diaz) into some espionage. Seems Roy has absconded on a perpetual-energy battery created by some just-out-of-high-school wunderkind, and his former agency partner wants it for bad purposes, as do some really bad Spanish gangsters. June's along for the ride because she got on a plane with Roy that she wasn't supposed to be on.\nSo at first it seems like a lovers-on-the-lam movie, much like the one with Ashton Kutcher and Katherine Heigl, but the big difference here is that it's eminently possible that Roy is, well, deranged, that he's actually the bad guy, who knows. It doesn't matter much. Because here's what's really nifty: Cruise's performance is like a knowing, appreciative nod to his work in the Mission:Impossible movies, only he manages to poke fun at his action-guy persona while still being that action guy.\nWe know that Tom Cruise can act on occasion. He was aces in Born on the Fourth of July and in Minority Report. But too often he phones it in entirely. He smirks and bluffs his way through a movie, trying to coast on fading charm. Now, he does all that here as well, but there's the added is-he-nuts part that gives the movie a real edgy quality to it. And Cruise, bless him, actually pulls it off. He's a fantastic action-guy actor, remember, but up until now he's never really come across as someone who's in on the joke, too. (For all his faults as an actor, Arnold Scwarzenegger at least gives you the impression that he knows he's sort of one dimensional.) Here, Cruise clearly gets it. He's cocky, but not in the mean-spirited, jerky way he was in most of his earlier, virtually indistinguishable films.\nThen there's Cameron Diaz, who for years was just plain terrible whenever she had to do something other than stand there and look purty. (That duty now falls to Heigl.) With The Box, Diaz showed she had dramatic-acting chops, and here she pulls off the action and comedy to even greater effect than with the Charlie's Angels movies. June isn't a mere victim, but she's believably confused and disoriented by the whirlwind of spy games going on around her. What makes Diaz's efforts so valuable here is that she's never a piece of the scenery; she's sincerely proactive and does a surprisingly good job of making you feel for her without playing on her sexuality to make the sale.\nJames Mangold is the director; he's given us the unevenness of Girl, Interrupted and Copland but also the awesomeness of Walk the Line. Like Walk the Line, he gets the most out of his two stars here, allowing Cruise and Diaz to overachieve monumentally. And Knight and Day is also a huge improvement over the last Cruise/Diaz collaboration, Vanilla Sky, which was a good example of what usually happens when Cruise attempts to act. Here, he returns to his action roots with a lighter, comedic touch, and it really works."}

The (mostly) Brit cast is unfailingly hilarious, and the movie doesn't dwell on emotional issues, thus keeping the festivities from getting too dull. And, indeed, it rocks.\nThe story takes us through the coming of age of one Carl (Tom Sturridge), who's been sent to live on the Radio Rock ship to live with his uncle Quentin (Bill Nighy), who runs the pirate radio station. There, Young Carl is indoctrinated in the ways of rock and roll - the movie's set in 1966, with Beatlemania in full swing - as well as the ways of the world. Escorting him into maturity are The Count (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Dr. Dave (Nick Frost), Simple Simon (Chris O'Dowd), and Midnight Mark (Tom Wisdom). Added to the mix is the legendary Gavin Kavanagh, played with \u00e9lan by Rhys Ifans, returning to the airwaves after being exiled to the US.\nMeanwhile, the British government takes notice, and one straight-backed bureaucrat, played with oily glee by Kenneth Branagh, is determined to shut down all of the pirate radio stations. Branagh seems like he's playing John Cleese playing a stubborn stuffed shirt, and truth be told I didn't even recognize him as Kenneth Branagh until well into the picture.\nThere's plenty of music - a lot of it anachronistically thrown into the mix - but hardly any musical montages, which is a refreshing change. I figured we'd see scenes of the crew swabbing the deck to the kicking tunes of Jan and Dean. But no, we hear a lot of great period music in the background, which only serves the plot well.\nIfans is a real delight as the egomaniacal Kavanagh, with a voice so velvety smooth, he's like a white Barry White. Aw, yeah. Hoffman is his equal as the irascible, irreducibly singular Count, an expat from America who doesn't cotton to the stupid, draconian English laws. Each is necessary; without the other, each would be just another faux leader of this band of misfits, but together... well, together they can work against each other. It's fun watching their egos clash.\nThe movie works chiefly because everyone seems like he's having a grand old time playing records and thumbing his nose at the establishment. This was just before the great sweeping activism bug that bit America (or just at its cusp), and rock and roll was a huge, huge part of that; it seems quaint, now, that Britain in the sixties forbade its playing on the radio. Can you imagine that today? Now, we have subscriber-supported satellite radio on which any number of foul-themed shows can appear with impunity, and the airwaves themselves are a little more lax than they used to be."}

It's aimless and largely laughless, despite a top-name cast.\nEwan McGregor plays a small-time U.S. journalist named Bob Wilton, who meets a man named Lyn Cassady, played by George Clooney, to claims to have taken part in a secret army unit that trained in the use of paranormal abilities to help win the war through fairly peaceful means, in a program called the New Earth Army. Cassady believes he's been given a mission by the group's leader, Bill Django (Jeff Bridges), so he heads into Iraq with Bob in tow.\nTruly, it's entertaining to see George Clooney, well, act, but despite his efforts here and his chemistry with McGregor (great swaths of the movie are of the buddy-pic variety), it's a doomed, wasted performance. Wilton and Cassady run into the sort of troubles you'd expect a single U.S. soldier and a journalist to run into in Iraq, including getting taken hostage by a mercenary \"security\" detail that's ostensibly there to help keep the peace. Where's it all leading? Well, no place special, it turns out.\nDirector Grant Heslov has trouble weaving the various tones and atmospheres together into a cogent movie. Cassady seems like a nice guy who may or may not have actual psychic abilities; Wilton seems befuddled or paranoid almost all of the time. Bridges is spacey; Kevin Spacey is a venomous coparticipant in the New Agey program. But they all seem to be in different movies.\nMany references are made to Jedi Knights, that the men who were in the New Earth Army \u2013 which is as hippy-dippy as it gets \u2013 are the peaceful warriors who use their mind tricks to win hearts and minds. Of course, McGregor himself appeared in three Star Wars films as a Jedi Knight, which makes one wonder if the producers scanned their Rolodexes for actors who had been actual virtual Jedi Knights already. Hooray for serendipity, huh? At any rate, Cassady is supposed to be on the Good Side of the Force (which isn't mentioned by name, but you know that's what they meant), and Spacey's Larry Hooper is supposed to be on the Dark Side \u2013 probably because he wants to use psychic powers for violent means. But rest assured, there's no killing (of humans) to be done in this movie using thinking caps.\nSo what is the point? It's an interesting story that Bob gets to tell his readers, but it feels a little underdeveloped here. The movie would have been better if it had stuck to a particular tone, whether it was slapstick or a straight-forward action movie. Either would have helped form a more cohesive plot. What we get instead was a jumble of personalities and factory-seconds puzzle pieces; it's as if the movie wanted to be existential and concrete at the same time. Call it Schroedinger's Movie."}

The dialog still crackles, the animation still sparkles, and the voice work still resonates. Well done all around.\nIt's been 15 years since the original feature, and in movie time that means that little Andy is about all grown up. Well, headed off to college, anyway. As the movie begins, he'll be leaving for higher education in a few days and needs to figure out what to do with his Woody and Buzz and Jessie and Hamm toys, and others - does he donate them to the local daycare center, or does he put them up in the attic for safekeeping? That's really the question at the heart of the movie. Are the toys better off with Andy, in college - or somewhere else? They realize he's growing up, but surely he hasn't forgotten them entirely. And sure enough, we come to learn just how much these toys mean to Andy. It's a coming-of-age movie disguised as a Playskool parable.\nThe gang's adventures lead them to the daycare center, where they meet up with a vast array of other toys, such as a Care Bear clone voiced by Ned Beatty, a Ken doll, and a Fisher-Price talking phone. One of the many hallmarks of this trilogy has been how well represented toys have been; obviously, Pixar (and Disney) spared no expense in getting the rights to some of these toys, which you have to admit is much better than the alternative: made-up toys no one cares about. That's a big reason the Toy Story movies work, of course, because they resonate with everyone. Each of us can see a piece of our childhood in the movie. That's why it bugs us when the evil neighbor kid or the evil toy collector do things to the toys, because they're not just toys to us - they're our toys, our lives, ourselves. To lay it on thickly.\nAnyway, what this one's all about is togetherness. Should Woody go with Andy to college while the others go to the attic, or wherever? Or should they stick together? The humor from the first two movies doesn't slow a bit, with wickedly whip-fast banter from Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head and John Ratzenberger as Hamm slicing the air with their barbs and trivia. There's even some mild character development - is that love I see between Buzz and Jessie? Another recurring theme in the series is that of abandonment. In TS2, Andy mistakenly put Woody in the family yard sale; here, the toys feel like they're similarly being put aside \"for later,\" knowing that there won't be a later with Andy all but grown up. There are also repeated friends-abandoning-friends scenes as well. And, it seems, each toy in these movies - well, the lead toys - has some kind of story about how their old owner loved them to pieces and then one day just abandoned them. That feeling of abandonment plays a huge part in this movie.\nThere's just so much to like about this. It's simply great to hear Tom Hanks and Tim Allen playing their famous characters again. In fact, there really are no slackers in the entire bunch of voice actors, especially Joan Cusack as Jessie. (And, thank goodness, we get only a couple of snippets of Randy Newman's \"You Got a Friend in Me.\") There are some sad scenes, but for the most part they're obscured by some really fantastic 3D action scenes (see Woody escape daycare! See the rest of the gang elude the trash truck! Thrill to everyone avoiding the incinerator!). In fact, the only really sad scene, the one that'll be sure to yank the heart out of all adults and no kids, is the one in which Andy's mom sees her son off to college. She cries, and so will you. It's not only the end of Andy's childhood, it's the end to all our Toy Story laughs.\nThe third Toy Story movie is warm hearted and elegant, a end to the trilogy that will really make your heart soar. It's a beautiful, hilarious movie that should be required viewing for kids of all ages."}

Viggo Mortensen is appropriately intense and grim, but the sense of utter hopelessness never goes away, even after the trite ending.\nThe Man (Mortensen) and The Boy (Kodi Smit-McPhee) have survived a cataclysmic event that has wiped out nearly every living creature - man, animal, bird, insect, plant. They have a single handgun with which to defend themselves, with two bullets - one for each of them, should the need arise. Most of the remaining few humans on the planet seem to be crazy and cannibals, or both. The Boy fervently wishes to believe they are the Good Guys and that they'll find more Good Guys once they reach their final destination. The Man just wants to keep hope alive in The Boy for a little while longer, as he himself is dying.\nIf you haven't read the Cormac McCarthy novel on which the film is based (and I haven't), you might find this all to be relentlessly downbeat. And it is, of course. But if we can look past the ash-covered landscape and the grayer and grayer attitudes, we see a compelling relationship dynamic between the two leads. Each depends so much on the other for physical and psychological survival, and to what end? There's no real promise of a better life anywhere, but The Man knows it's his job to make The Boy believe that will be the case. They scrounge whatever they can, pushing their belongings in an old shopping cart, and witness unspeakable, plausible atrocities along the way. The Man is stuck in a quandary; The Boy needs to believe they're doing the right thing, but sometimes they need to do wrong things (like kill cannibals in defense) in order to survive.\nAside from all that hopelessness, what bothered me about this movie was The Boy himself. He was born just after the cataclysm occurred, several years ago, and he and The Man have been on the road ever since. And yet it seemed that whenever there was trouble, The Boy would cry out or whine and cry and yell and do things that you'd expect someone who had just that moment gone on the run would do, but not someone who'd been at it for a little while and who'd basically spent his entire life in that situation. You could tell that he was meant to be rebelling a little - i.e., losing some hope - but he seemed less petulant and more, you know, stupid.\nThe ending itself probably plays out a lot better in the book. Certainly, I won't give it away here, but to me it seemed a little obvious and running against the grain of the rest of the film, almost to the point where it made their travels seem without a point.\nThis is not a movie that will excite you. It's not funny, and although there are action scenes they're there merely to offset the existentialism of the main plot (the relationship of Boy and Man). There are mysteries - what caused this desolation? Who are the people they run into? - that are best left either minimally answered or entirely unsolved. (In fact, it's not important what the cataclysm was, so don't expect to find out a lot about it.) The Road is long and marked with the occasional pothole, but it can be rewarding if you're looking for a strong acting performance (by Mortensen) against a somber, stark backdrop."}

The yin/yang chemistry between Russell Brand as a druggie rock star and Jonah Hill is believable and entertaining, and aside from the typical awkward nonslapstick scenes from writer Judd Apatow, the movie generally works.\nAldous Snow (Brand), introduced in 2008's Forgetting Sarah Marshall, is now a washed-up rocker. He's been on the wagon, then off it. His band, Infant Sadness, hasn't played in ten years. Then a young record-company intern named Aaron Green (Hill) gets the idea of having the band reunite for a tenth anniversary show at the famed Greek Theater in Los Angeles. Aaron's high-octane boss Sergio (P. Diddy) instructs his charge to jet to London, gather up Snow and fly him to New York to be on the Today Show, then fly him to LA for the reunion show. Hilarity ensues.\nIt actually does, too. Naturally, Aaron and Aldous are complete opposites \u2013 one a party-hardy hedonist and one more of a button-down, take-no-chances drip, one who has many brief encounters with the female kind and one who is just coming out of a long-term relationship. Or so he thinks, anyway. And as much as Aaron wants to get things moving along, Aldous wants to tarry and enjoy life a bit longer, sort of a microcosm of their individual lives up to that point.\nIt's no surprise that each does a little bit of growing up along the way. But we're not meant to focus on that. Instead, Aaron and Aldous experience wacky escapades along the lines of Bachelor Party, with echoes of Pulp Fiction and The Hangover. What makes it all work is that it's not just one zany scene after another; director Nicholas Stoller tosses in some serious moments that are meant to humanize Aldous a bit more and take the edge off a little.\nThe movie as a whole is effective in part because Brand is such a gifted comic who's made the Aldous Snow character his own. Brand as Snow electrifies the room when he walks in, sort of what you'd expect from a glamorous rocker. Even one who has some deep-seated issues of his own. See, the movie moves along pretty damn well when it's concentrating on the wackiness, with a smidge of seriousness thrown in, but when too much focus is diverted to those serious psychological issues, then it sort of crumbles. And it's not just issues with Aldous Snow, either; there are a few that try to work out Aaron's own problems (although for most of the movie he's befuddled and along for the ride, a well-meaning patsy).\nIn particular, there is one scene near the end in which Aldous attempts to help Aaron and his girlfriend Daphne resolve their differences. Like with the more serious scenes in Forgetting Sarah Marshall \u2013 also directed by Stoller, and the movie to which this is sort of a sequel \u2013 the scene seems pointless and jarring. It's the opposite of what you, as viewer, want to see, as it's neither sexy nor funny nor illuminating.\nAnother slight debit is P. Diddy. The man can play unhinged well, but he's not always funny here \u2013 sometimes he just comes off as a mean jerk. And not in the Mr. Dithers (boss of Dagwood Bumstead) way, either, not in the comically inept gangster way, just sort of sour and bitter. A little more work might help him, since I believe this was his first comedic attempt. And for a first attempt, it ain't bad.\nThe bottom line is that Get Him to the Greek is really funny for a good portion of the film, with only a few dips into ill-advised sentimentality that just isn't effective and even helps kill the mood. Both Brand and Hill are well cast and are hysterical."}

The first two were plenty of fun, but the third one was merely okay and this final one is just tepid, sleepwalking through its own milieu with a script that seems to have had all the jokes removed.\nAs movie series progress, the makers must come up with new situations for their protagonists to experience. So here, Shrek makes a deal with Rumplestiltskin that alters the timelines of him and everyone else in Far, Far Away: he gets one day in which to live as a regular old ogre, just like before he met Fiona and Donkey; in return, Rumplestiltskin gets one of Shrek's days for himself. Turns out he chooses the day the big green fella was born, which (obviously) means a new timeline in which he never saved Fiona from the castle (among other things).\nIt's almost a crutch, having a main character live his life in an alternate timeline, because that way you can have that main character re-meet all his friends. It's like getting a second origin story. And sure enough, we meet several of the characters from the earlier films, such as Pinocchio, the Gingerbread Man, and the Three Little Pigs, not to mention Donkey's red-dragon wife. And naturally, because everyone in this timeline is used to a world in which Rumplestiltskin is large and in charge, Shrek needs to do a little convincing. Not the least of which is to Fiona herself, because \u2013 as the ironclad contract with Rumple notes \u2013 only true love's kiss can break the deal.\nThe thing I liked most about the first couple of Shrek movies was the unending patter of jokes. Lots of pop-culture references (anachronistically), many of which worked. Lots of gross-out gags, too. And great chemistry between characters, even though they'd just met. It all sort of clicked then, but none of that is apparent in this fourth installment. The humor is, at best, scattershot \u2013 and not in the Airplane! style, either, where characters make seemingly hundreds of jokes a minute, with some working and some not. It almost feels as if there were a joke quota here, only it's a maximum of two per reel.\nShrek 4 is charmless, too. I know we're supposed to root for Shrek (and the ending isn't unsatisfying), but his adventures trying to get his true love's kiss are sometimes tedious and uninspired. The problem here is that Shrek the character is supposed to be a grouchy bastard, but he's typically offset by the wild extrovertism of Donkey and the sweetness of Fiona. And since this alternate timeline indicates that neither has met Shrek, neither gets to balance out his irascible behavior.\nThere were plenty of little tykes in the theater this morning, and I didn't really hear a lot of oohs and ahhs or laughs. It could be that Shrek Forever After failed to be broad enough in its humor and yet too intense in its action to appeal to its core audience. The series can finally rest."}

The story is complex but not tortuous, and there's plenty of moral ambiguity to go around. It's a movie that offers no easy solution to the problems it presents, although the ending doesn't quite satisfy.\nArthur Lewis (Marsden) is a NASA scientist; wife Norma (Diaz) is a professor. Early one morning, a mysterious box is placed on their doorstep. The next day, a disfigured man named Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) visits; he tells the somewhat incredulous couple that if they press the button inside the box, they will receive one million dollars in cash \u2013 but someone whom they do not know will die.\nIt's an interesting conundrum, especially since it comes as Arthur has been denied is application to be an astronaut and Norma is being dropped from her college. So they need the money. But they don't want anyone to die, either. Mr. steward is not forthcoming with details \u2013 for all they know, the dead person could be completely innocent. Or he or she could be a serial killer. They just don't know. Not only that, but examination of the box proves to Arthur that it's a hoax \u2013 there are no wires, no mechanism for transmitting. Pressing the button, he concludes, would do nothing. That doesn't really end the debate, though, and ultimately, almost resignedly, Norma hits the button herself. And sure enough, the next day, Mr. Steward shows up with a million dollars.\nNaturally, it's not that simple. They try to return the money (no can do), but more to the point they're embroiled in a surreal set of increasingly odd situations, such as people giving them cryptic messages while suffering nosebleeds. The couple also discovers that there may be much, much more to Mr. Steward than meets the eye.\nI think what I liked about this movie was that it followed up with its intriguing premise rather well. The movie never seems to lag, and it also doesn't bog us down with red herrings. Not that every detail is of utmost importance; it's just an efficient plot, albeit somewhat complicated. The movie challenges the viewer to keep up, that is, but not pointlessly so. It provides enough plausible information \u2013 within the construct of its own story \u2013 that one can become enmeshed in it without feeling trapped.\nI also liked both Diaz and Marsden, although the former's Southern accent takes a little getting used to. (And that's not because it seems inauthentic; rather, it just felt odd to hear that voice coming from Cameron Diaz). And Frank Langella is perfectly cast as usual as the sinister, inscrutable Steward. Is he evil? Amoral? If this is a test of our naive couple, how do we know if they've passed? Is Steward a mere courier? The film is based on a short story by the legendary Richard Matheson (I Am Legend, The Shrinking Man, A Stir of Echoes) called \"Button, Button\"; it was later a Twilight Zone episode, like many other Matheson stories."}

Iron Man 2 met my expectations as a solid popcorn-movie followup, complete with believable characters, a plausible plot, and lots and lots of action.\nStark (Robert Downey Jr.), revealed to the world as Iron Man in the first film is quickly subpoenaed by Congress, which wants his weapons. Stark, of course, is adamant that the feds not get their hands on, well, his own body. This leads to the introduction of Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), who holds many government contracts and who is apparently insanely jealous of Tony Stark's success.\nMeanwhile, in a far-off land, a tattooed Mickey Rourke \u2013 playing a Russian physicist, no less \u2013 plots his revenge on Stark, something about his dad being done wrong by Stark's dad lo those many years ago. And this leads to Rourke becoming Whiplash, a man powered by a device similar to Stark's own chest implant, only with giant electric whips. Neat trick, huh? That the military eventually \u2013 okay, quickly \u2013 gets its hands on one of Stark's suits shouldn't come as much of a surprise. But in this movie, anyway, the army isn't the bad guy, so there's that. After all, Stark's best buddy is James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes, played here by the excellent Don Cheadle, who's a lieutenant colonel. And you just know, having seen the first movie, that Rhodey will suit up himself here, as War Machine.\nAlthough the movie gets off to a slow start, focusing a bit too much on Stark the person rather than on Iron Man the action dude, it perks up when other characters enter the fray, particularly Scarlett Johansson as a notary in the employ of Stark Enterprises. (Note: She's not just a notary.) Downey Jr. is amiable as always as Tony Stark, and it's as great of a fit here as before. (Some would say this role represents typecasting for Downey Jr.) Stark is brave but vulnerable, smart but besotted. He's lost without Pepper Potts, his assistant and true love, and their relationship dips and crests throughout the movie as well.\nIn fact, all returning actors reprise their roles rather well, and most of the new ones immerse themselves in the Iron Man universe seamlessly \u2013 including, I should note, Samuel L. Jackson, who barely appeared in the first Iron Man movie but is in several more scenes this time around, as Nick Fury. Yes, THE Nick Fury. Garry Shandling's also on board as an oleaginous senator.\nOnly real quibble is with Rockwell as the slimy Hammer. At first, this looked like a role more suited to Greg Kinnear \u2013 smarmy white dude \u2013 which would be beneath Rockwell, who's a strong actor. But later on it looked more like Rockwell was too \u2013 pardon me \u2013 cute for the role as Hammer, who turns out to be much more ruthless than at first blush. Sam Rockwell doesn't look ruthless at all, and he isn't convincingly ruthless.\nStill, quite a bit of fun. There should be at least one more IM film, says director Jon Favreau (who has an on screen role as well, as #1 helperdude Happy Hogan)."}

It's a bold, highly evocative movie helped in no small part by two towering performances, by Gabourey Sidibe and Mo'Nique.\nI might well be the last person in the world to see this film \u2013 at least among those who intended to see it in the first place. It's not a pleasant movie, despite its underdog-against-all-odds story. In fact, so much of the subject matter is terrifying to watch, so starkly realistic is its portrayal.\nSo if you've been thinking you might get around to this movie \u2013 maybe after it did so well at the Oscars \u2013 you should know right away that this won't be a movie that's enjoyable to watch. It's very, very dark, even if its issues are expertly handled.\nPrecious (Sidibe) is 16 years old and pregnant with her second child. She's illiterate, although she does like math class. She's physically and emotionally abused by her welfare mother Mary (Mo'Nique). But because she's pregnant \u2013 oh, and did I mention her dad's the father? \u2013 she's been suspended from school, forced to try an alternative place called Each One, Teach One. There, Precious does find her own measure of redemption.\nBut this really isn't just a simple movie of the week, or even a Lifetime movie: although Precious does find an outlet for her pain and suffering and a way out of her mess, it is not a perfect solution \u2013 for anyone. The movie doesn't end with Precious walking into the sunset with a rainbow appearing over her head and birds chirping.\nThis is a movie heavily steeped in realism, drawing attention to the plight of not only children in inner-city slums but also to those suffering from malicious, bitter parents who deeply resent the potential success their child represents. Mary, a constant cauldron of seething rage, treats Precious as little more than a slave and desperately wishes to prevent even a fleeting moment of self-esteem and courage.\nThe cause of Mary's rancor isn't really clear until the very end \u2013 in a satisfying, but open-ended, denouement \u2013 but all we need to know is how savagely intense her hatred is. But no matter how intense the hatred gets, Mary \u2013 thanks to Mo'Nique's earthy portrayal \u2013 never seems wholly over the top. In fact, she seems so real you wind up cringing from her in the safety of your living room.\nAs Precious, Sidibe is both vulnerable and strong. You can't help but feel terrible for her, naturally, but Sidibe manages to make us feel happy for her chances as well. It'd be too easy for her to be simply a victim who perseveres against the odds; it's harder for her to show that she has some amount of tenacity that in turn allows her to feel good about herself for a change. Sidibe's debut performance (!!!) is exquisite and unnerving.\nAlso worthy of note is \u2013 of all people \u2013 Mariah Carey, as a social worker. She's almost unrecognizable, both physically and in terms of her performance. Who knew that Mariah Carey could act at all, let alone flourish in such a demanding role? Precious is a stunning, gripping movie, although its tragic situations \u2013 and horrifying revelations \u2013 might turn off some viewers. It's bleak, but not relentlessly so; it's hopeful, but not inauthentically so."}

It's filled with dislikeable, unsympathetic yahoos and is riddled with implausible decisions. It's generally a waste of time.\nElsa (Sarah Polley) and Clive (Adrien Brody) are hotshot researchers who are attempting to create a new lifeform, which they will then use to solve mankind's disease problems, like Alzheimer's and Down Syndrome. They're successful, of course, but the success gives Elsa the idea of splicing together some human DNA and that of a human. You know, to see what will happen, document the amazing awesomeness of said result, and learn from the experiment.\nBut, as you might gather, something goes wrong \u2013 Elsa becomes emotionally attached to her creation, which for some reason she and Clive must keep hidden in a giant barn, far away from the prying eyes of their supervisors, who stereotypically want results now now now, so they can sell something.\nThe first problem I have with the movie is that Elsa and Clive aren't exactly Good People. They're dedicated scientists, sure, but they're doing the wrong things for the wrong reasons. Ethics apparently wasn't a required course wherever these two received their medical degrees, because they continually break the rules for their own advancement. And let's be clear about that \u2013 this isn't about them breaking unjust rules, or doing something likewise noble, it's about flouting conventional wisdom and the sanctity of scientific process for the sake of who knows what.\nThe second problem is that even though these two aren't really sympathetic, there's still no evildoer against whom we can root. Their corporate overlords, the ones who bankroll all their research, are bad only in the sense that they expect results. This doesn't seem unreasonable to me, but I think we're meant to believe it's a horrible thing and that the suits upstairs are evil little demons. It's just not so, though; if anyone's wronged in this movie, it's the evil corporate overlords, and that's not what you look for in a movie, typically.\nFinally, it does seem that every decision that either Clive or Elsa (but mostly Elsa, sadly) makes is the obviously terrible one. At one point Clive remarks that \"it's no longer about the science,\" referring to Elsa's obsession with their creation. The trouble is that it never was about the science. From the practically the first scene, everything they do has a nonscientific basis of reasoning. For hotshot science people, these two make their decisions based on emotions and little else. There's no evidence of thinking through their experiment and its consequences, intended or not; they don't even seem concerned with putting up safeguards.\nDid I mention this new creature is part animal \u2013 and yet at no point do we learn what animal? Turns out \u2013 no spoiler \u2013 it's not one, but several animals. And it never occurred to these doofuses that bad things might happen? That the defense mechanism of one animal might kick in? And, lest we forget, human DNA was also used. Humans are extremely violent and adaptable, so let's combine their ingenuity with the tenacity and savagery of other animals \u2013 plus give them the gifts of flight and underwater breathing, and wouldn't that be fun? Yikes. From laughable dialogue to a terrible, predictable finale, Splice is a loser on most levels. Polley and Brody seem earnest, but they're overwhelmed by the rancid, dopey plot."}

Set against a backdrop of post-September 11 New York City, the movie follows two lifelong friends \u2013 one who's compartmentalizing his life, taking few chances, and one who's lashing out and acting out, each in the funk of a sustained mental freefall.\nJake (Jacob Fishel) is an aspiring novelist whose career as a sportswriter is creeping along; he's the one who's been recently dumped by a \"free-spirited\" (read: independently selfish) beauty who appears to manipulate Jake at every turn, for her own gain. Andrew (Aaron Stanford) is reacting to his own professional demise (he's just been fired) by drinking heavily.\nIt may seem that these two are bound to embark on a wacky road trip wherein they metaphorically find themselves, and that's half of what happens next; they do take off in the middle of the night \u2013 at Andrew's behest \u2013 with no particular destination in mind, but no zany escapades ensue. Instead, we learn \u2013 not really a spoiler \u2013 that Andrew's estranged dad has just passed away, and they're actually on their way to the funeral.\nOnce they get to the town in which Andrew's dad lived, each friend reacts to adversity somewhat differently; one decides to stay and help with the funeral arrangements, and one does not. Thrown into the mix is a pretty waitress named Leslie (Rosemarie DeWitt of \"The United States of Tara\") who \u2013 somewhat abruptly \u2013 falls for one of the guys.\nSlice-of-life character studies can be difficult to talk about, because they're even more subjective than most movies. For me, How I Got Lost was slow without much of a payoff at the end. Or in the middle, for that matter; for the most part, the movie felt like it was drifting as aimlessly as its characters. Jacob is likable and does the right thing, and Andrew is somewhat less likable and hardly ever does the right thing. Both are believable characters, and their chemistry \u2013 and that of Fishel and Stanford \u2013 was palpable.\nBut I think the movie lacked a real hook to get me to care much about the characters beyond the superficiality of \"I hope they wind up happy.\" The characters themselves were generic (a straight man, an obnoxious drunk), and although it was clear they were good pals, they never really resonated beyond those broad definitions. Add that to the methodical pacing of the movie, and I became bored pretty quickly.\nYour mileage may vary, but I found How I Got Lost \u2013 although a serious look at dealing with pain and grief \u2013 to be a little to stuffy and downbeat. Without a lighter yin to its desolate yang, the movie just stumbles along like a college student awakening the morning after pulling an all nighter, with senses dulled and motor skills only slightly functionable."}

Jude Law stars as an employee of a company that sells artificial organs to lucky ducks who need them \u2013 at high interest rates \u2013 and then repossesses them when the payments aren't met.\nThe ads for this movie made it look almost like a satirical look at health care. Repo Men is set in the near future, when apparently everyone needs organs of some kind. Law plays Remy, the top employee at The Union (of course he is) who undergoes an epiphany when he blacks out and needs a new heart (of course he does), the payments for which (of course) he eventually can't make. Will The Union send someone \u2013 maybe his longtime partner Jake (Forest Whitaker) to repo the heart? Or will Remy, who now sees how badly immoral he's been, somehow topple the evil predatory corporation? We'll pretend, for the sake of argument, that this is science fiction. After all, you don't see companies \u2013 private companies, mind you \u2013 attacking citizens and harvesting their organs, right? But that's about the only fictitious aspect of this movie, because it's mired in clich\u00e9s of movies and everyday life anyway. Sci-fi can be tough to write; it has to be smart enough to stand under the weight of its own science but be entertaining enough to sell the plot. Repo Men isn't smart or entertaining, except to bloodbath aficionados, I suppose.\nWhat is Remy's motivation, except to survive? Are we supposed to see him as the plucky good guy going up against an evil company? Tough to do that when he slaughters scores and scores of people, even unarmed, even by hacksaw and sword. Remy doesn't seem so much as someone trying to do the right thing as someone trying to settle a personal score. Naturally, this culminates with an extended fight scene in which Remy \u2013 and his new heroine, Beth (Alice Braga) \u2013 take on not only tough goons from the corporation but also apparent office wonks, complete with neckties and pocket protectors and armed with almost nothing.\nThe ending is especially ludicrous, involving a hare-brained scheme to get themselves out of The Union's system (which shows them as delinquent), as if that's all it takes. Remy accomplishes this in full view of the company's honcho (Liev Schrieber) and his own (ex) partner, Jake. \"See, I'm not in the system! I rule!\" Well, yeah, but they saw you do it and they know you're overdue, so what the heck, Jake? It's not Chinatown.\nRepo Men is riddled with plot twists that are either blindingly obvious or make little sense. Even propelling the plot isn't a task these twists are up to. To be sure, there's plenty of action, but it feels almost out of place. It's also very bloody, which you expect from a movie in which the main characters slice open living humans to grab their livers or whatever, but it's very bloody on top of that, with knives slammed into necks, limbs seemingly hacked off, and so on.\nThe two twists near the end are almost Shyamalanesque, in that they seem to be there merely because they're twists of some sort, not because they're plausible or, you know, not ridiculous.\nRepo Men might not be the worst of the first quarter of 2010, but it has to be a front runner. A waste of a good cast, particularly Whitaker and Schrieber."}

Heartbroken, Temna builds a robot double of his dead son, using stored memories and a strand of his hair in combination with an energy core. When robot-Toby awakes, he has no recollection of dying \u2013 it's as if everything is continuing as always.\nBut Dr. Temna wouldn't be much of a super scientist if he didn't also give his new robot son super powers, right? Turns out that Toby, who begins calling himself Astro Boy, can fly, shoot rockets from his hands, talk to other robots, and so on. It's not long before President Stone realizes Toby is \"alive\" and has powers; he quickly guesses that Dr. Temna used some of the energy-core stuff he'd put in The Peacemaker to create Astro Boy, so he wants the robot captured and disposed of. Astro Boy flees Metro City for the relative safety of the mostly abandoned planet itself, which by now is covered in refuse (mostly robot parts), where he meets such characters as the Robot Revolutionary Front and orphaned, cast-off kids (who think he's as human as they are). Naturally, Astro Boy beats the odds and, with the help of his plucky new friends, defeats the evil President Stone.\nAstro Boy was first seen as a manga series in 1952, so it's been around for quite a while. That said, its popularity hasn't really soared in the United States relative to its staying power in Japan. I'm not sure this movie is going to solve that conundrum, either; it's visually well told, but the movie lacks heart and \u2013 quite frankly \u2013 feels like it was spit out of a computer calibrated to change imaginative enterprises into soulless ghouls.\nI'm exaggerating, but basically this movie never really resonated with me. And I'm not really part of its purported intended audience, either; I'm older than your average manga fan, and I've only peripherally heard of Astro Boy to begin with. That means that for me, this was a new character in a new environment. The film does a pretty good job showing Astro Boy's origins and raison d'etre without getting too bogged down in the minutiae of his development, but it really doesn't let me identify with him (or, by proxy, imagining AB as a younger version of myself). The relationship between Toby/AB and his father is really a huge part of his psychological makeup (son wanting to impress dad, dad wanting to be proud of his son no matter who he is), and although one wouldn't expect that relationship to be completely explored here, what we do get feels flat and completely uninvolving.\nOne reason for this may be the voice casting. Freddie Highmore (Astro Boy) is, as always, fantastic, but the supporting cast is pretty lame. Nicolas Cage isn't over the top (for once), but he veers too far in the other direction \u2013 a dull monotone. They may as well have gotten an actual robot to read his lines. Donald Sutherland can usually be counted on to be a suitable bad guy, but here he's almost lifeless, a dopey caricature who seems to be in a completely different movie. If you're expecting a villain on the level of Maleficient or Scar, you'll be disappointed.\nThis film version of Astro Boy is a little less than wondrous. It does have a likable lead, but the story and voice characterizations are too basic and one dimensional, even for an animated movie."}

They're mildly successful in this somewhat-funny throwback to the ski-lodge jocks vs. dorks movies of the 1980s that teeters between being a laugh-out-loud dip in nostalgia and a simple knock off of a funnier movie (last year's The Hangover).\nJohn Cusack is Adam, a sad sack pitiful wreck whose vengeful girlfriend has just dumped him, taking almost everything in the house. Craig Robinson \u2013 late of Zach and Miri Make a Porno \u2013 is Nick, a married man shackled to his dead-end job as a high-end groomer. Rob Corddry is Lou, who's even more pathetic; when he drunkenly attempts suicide, the other two tell him in the hospital that they're all going to a legendary camp at which they all partied back in the day. They bring along Adam's grown nephew Jacob (Clark Duke), for no other reason than to have some kind of moral compass.\nSomehow, the hot tub at their cabin in the mountains magically transports them to when they were, well, young and dumb, with their entire lives in front of them. In fact, as luck would have it, they're all (except for Jacob) in the same place they were 20 years prior, at the site of the Winterfest music-and-fun extravaganza where each of them did Something that forever altered their life paths. Which, if we know our movie time-traveling logic, means that they can't do anything this time around, or else they'll risk screwing their own futures up.\nAt first glance, you might think that Cusack plays the Everyman of the group, but that's not necessarily the case here. He's a down-on-his-luck schmuck, like Lloyd Dobler in Say Anything\u0085, or even Rob Gordon in High Fidelty, but he's also kind of a crass jackhole, which is not a role Cusack normally plays. But he's not a complete jerk, either; he just sort of disappears into a vapid, staticy role that almost melts into the chaotic scenery. It almost feels as if he were cast purely because he used to be in these movies in the 80s himself, unlike his costars. But that would be about the only reason. Cusack's Adam isn't an underdog fighting the rich bullies; he's really playing the role of Best Bud. The problem is that there's no Main Dude for him to be the Best Bud to, and let's be honest \u2013 John Cusack is no wingman, anyway.\nLuckily, Rob Corddry \u2013 playing the selfish jerk of the bunch \u2013 is able to swoop in and shamelessly steal the movie. It's like stealing a grain of sand from the Sahara. Corddry is all energy, all angst and anger and bald head and rage and hormones and id, lots and lots of id. All id, all the time with Lou. His scenes \u2013 and there are many \u2013 really perk everyone up, raising chaos up a few notches.\nThe movie glosses over an interesting dilemma, though: if you went back in time, to when you were just entering your adult years, would you make the same decisions you made the first time around? The guys here get that opportunity, and some deviate from their norm a little bit. And some things get deviated for them, too. Reference is made to the stupid Ashton Kutcher movie The Butterfly Effect, something something about how if a butterfly flaps its wings in one hemisphere, a calamity occurs in another hemisphere. (I believe this is actually chaos theory, but let's not quibble.) So whether by accident or on purpose, their behavior alters everything. But since this is a comedy that's a bit lighter than, say, Back to the Future, I don't think we need to worry too much about what'll happen when they do get back to good ol' 2010.\nIn all, Hot Tub Time Machine is a good throwback movie. It's entertaining if you went through the 1980s, certainly \u2013 and the period music is pretty damn awesome, and if you didn't, you'll have plenty to laugh at. The actors give engaging performances, but the jokes are often lackluster. In fact, if anything there should have been far more homages to 80s films. Can you believe this movie was set in a ski lodge and set in the 1980s, and yet there was only the slightest passing reference to Cusack's quintessential 80s hit Better Off Dead? Shame."}

It moves slowly and demands extra attention, but even if you're really into the story you might wonder where those 107 minutes went.\nBen Stiller, in a terrific performance, is the titular ne'er do well, an itinerant carpenter housesitting for his brother in Los Angeles for six weeks. During that time, be meets and falls in and out of like for his brother's executive assistant Florence (Greta Gerwig, who's also magnificent), who's just as awkward as Roger Greenberg.\nThe bulk of the film covers their relationship on one track and the events of Greenberg's past that have led to his existential where-am-I ponderances. Some 15 years earlier, Roger was in a band out of college with a few good friends. They were apparently quite good, but when a record company offered them a deal, Roger turned it down, afraid of the success it might bring. This led to a serious rift in the band, causing each member to go his separate way; none of the members has played much music in the intervening years.\nLiking Roger isn't easy for anyone, not even the audience. He's sort of a jerk. (It's mentioned that he's just been released from a mental institution, although the cause for his hospitalization is not explained.) The film indicates that Roger has problems maintaining relationships, sometimes acting out - and lashing out - in order to keep himself safe and serene. His arrival in LA allows him to reconnect with several of his old friends, many of whom he hasn't seen in those 15 years.\nIt's these fractured relationships that hold the key to Greenberg's life. At times, he tries to patch things up and move on with his life, but he's just as likely to snap at the friend or lapse into the same behavioral issues that had plagued him as a young man.\nStiller is really, really good in this. He's surprisingly very good at showing myriad emotions convincingly. At once, you believe Greenberg is a polarizing, hurting, hurtful man on the cusp of the rest of his life. Stiller's brand of comedy can take time to grow on someone, but he really shows his range here. I certainly didn't know he could plumb the depths of a character like he did to Roger Greenberg.\nGerwig is his equal and is a real presence here. Florence is - like her namesake Nightingale - a huge help to Greenberg's brother as his assistant, and he's much more savvy about taking care of the house than Greenberg is about taking care of himself (in a funny early scene, she asks him to make a list of things for her to get at the store, and he writes \"whiskey\" and \"sandwiches\"). But as good as she is at her professional life, her personal life is an absolute mess. She goes on one-night stands because they feel good - okay, no problem there - but she has few true connections in life. She has one good friend, and you get the impression that her family isn't really close to her (she says her niece doesn't relate too well to her). Florence is physically and emotionally awkward, unsure of herself in all ways save for her job, in which she's commanding. This, of course, also makes her terribly vulnerable to the advances of the older Greenberg.\nSo the acting is really top notch, but the movie just isn't for everyone. Here's why. There's a lot of plot, a lot of things happening, but very little is resolved or accomplished; the film almost feels like a stream of consciousness to which we're privy. What WILL Greenberg do after the six weeks are up? Will he stay with Florence? Will he jilt her? In the end, does it really matter? Probably not; the ending is abrupt, although not out of place for the rest of the film. But one really needs to be atuned to Greenberg's plight in order to enjoy the film. If one isn't, the movie's mostly dull with bits of funny moments interspersed throughout. I didn't find it terribly heartwarming, just a character study of an unlikable character. Which is not a bad thing at all, but this one just didn't completely work for me."}

Not one with, you know, super powers or anything, just one with a mask and good intentions. Dave buys a wetsuit and costumes himself as the eponymous hero \u2013 and quickly finds himself on the wrong end of a knife. But that's okay, too, because the resulting surgeries implant metal in his body. You know, like Wolverine. Soon, he's back and, uh, kicking ass, and his exploits are all over YouTube.\nAt the same time, a mob boss named D'Amico (Mark Strong) is running all sorts of deals all over the city: weapons, drugs, graft, murder, and so on. Then eight of his guys are knocked out by a costumed man, and D'Amico \u2013 with the help of his sniveling son Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) \u2013 decides Kick-Ass is his man, since he's basically the only costumed hero anyone knows about. Soon D'Amico and his well-armed minions are after poor, hapless Dave. Turns out that the costumed man trying to take down D'Amico is Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage), who, with his deceptively adorable daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), has been targeting D'Amico's operations in a sort of revenge game.\nThere are a few wonderful themes being developed in this film. One is that ordinary guys can do extraordinary things. Another is that the geek can get the girl, as long as he's honest. A third is that even well-prepared heroes bleed from time to time. Kick-Ass is part Spider-Man and part Quentin Tarantino's World of Comic-Book Heroes. Now, it's true that these themes may not be all that unique, particularly to movies, but the essential take-away point is that the heroes here are infused with no small amount of humanity. They are in no way, shape, or form perfect people; they simply are.\nDave Lizewski doesn't suddenly become awesome when he wears his Kick-Ass costume; he's a great person, daring to stand up for the little guy. When he sees the level of training that Hit Girl and Big Daddy have achieved, he knows he's in over his head. But the experience gives him the confidence to connect with a previously unattainable high-school hottie, Katie. Echoes of Spider-Man, sure, but somehow Johnson is a little more believable than Tobey Maguire.\nThe violence is pretty visceral \u2013 bad guys are mowed down in cold-blooded fashion by ostensibly good guys \u2013 but what might really grab you is the incredibly adult performance by Moretz. She's 13, by the way, and she looks like she's 11, but here she talks like she's a grizzled pirate. Moretz uses all of the Carlin dirty words and some more you might not have heard of. It's a little off-putting to hear such a tiny little squirt use such language, especially while engaging in bloody, realistic combat, and it wouldn't surprise me to learn that her role is viewed with some controversy. Moretz's Hit Girl is very reminiscent of Gogo Yubari from Kill Bill Vol. 1, but her Kewpie Doll looks serve an even greater contrast to her intentions and actions.\nKick-Ass is both evocative and heart warming. It's not the kind of movie you watch while cuddling with a honey, though, as its sweeter side is mostly kept in the background. But it's those sweet moments that help prevent the film from being a rudderless mess."}

There are a scattering of scares in The Fourth Kind, but for the most part it's a cheap thrill ride that doesn't live up to its promise and.\nI knew I was in trouble right from the first scene, when actress Milla Jovovich explains that she's actress Milla Jovovich, and that she will be portraying Dr. Abigail Tyler in The Fourth Kind. Right away I knew this wasn't exactly going to be a high-brow make-you-think horror movie. The filmmakers knew their audience, and they wanted to make sure it knew what was going on. Okay, so she's an actress playing the doctor to the events happened in real life.\n(Except she wasn't. Even though the movie was said to be based on reported abductions that occurred in Nome, Alaska, no specific events were found to back up the movie's claims.) Basically, Dr. Tyler \u2013 mourning the murder of her husband and toting her two young children \u2013 treks to Nome to continue her late mate's psychological research, involving weird things happening to people while they dream. Three of her patients relate to her that they have awoken to see an owl at their window. Tyler uses hypnosis to see if the patients can more fully recall the occurrence, but each has a terrible reaction \u2013 one, so despondent and upset over what the analysis has revealed, takes his entire family hostage with a gun. Bad things happen.\nEventually, Dr. Tyler \u2013 and her own shrink, Dr. Campos (Elias Koteas) \u2013 come to think that maybe, perhaps, each of the victims \u2013 just three of many reporting the same experiences in Nome \u2013 was abducted by aliens. Yes, aliens. They come to this conclusion in part because a video recording reveals that one of the patients spoke the ancient language of the Sumerians while under hypnosis! Apparently, the Sumerians are well known for having been contacted; it's why they were able to speak fluent Sumerian, I gather.\nIf the movie had taken the tack of showing us these events using purported real footage \u2013 like Blair Witch did \u2013 it might have been worlds more entertaining. But director Olatunde Osunsanmi instead decided to flip back and forth between \"file footage\" and obviously filmed scenes, and the mix is jarring and tough to follow. Not that the plot's tough to follow, mind you; it's just that the constant switching back and forth \u2013 and using not only Jovovich as Tyler but another actress as the \"real\" Tyler (again, fake; there is no Dr. Tyler) and having their scenes not only follow each other but often play out simultaneously \u2013 made for a wholly incoherent mess.\nOne thing that made a movie like Blair Witch work was that the directors went all-cheap \u2013 they used completely unknown actors playing themselves and shot the movie using hand-held cameras, for the most part. The Fourth Kind uses known actors \u2013 so there's little chance it'd be confused with a documentary \u2013 and elaborate, clearly fabricated set designs, so instead of a chilling could-it-be-real horror thriller, you're stuck with an obviously made-up depiction of events that \u2013 as it turns out \u2013 didn't happen in the first place. So it all sort of feels like a gyp.\nYou expect a lot from a little in horror movies these days; with The Fourth Kind, you get a little from a lot. Jovovich and Koteas give it the old college try, but their efforts are wasted by terrible direction and poor editing. Will Patton, who plays the world's most constipated sheriff here, is also a debit."}
< {"rating": "6", "date": "6 March 2010", "title_id": "tt1014759", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "Fun to look at, anyway", "content": "In this reimagining of the Lewis Carroll stories, Alice returns to Wonderland after a ten-year absence and finds herself pegged as the savior for the mystical land, now ruled with an iron fist and bulbous head by the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter). Tim Burton's film is, as expected, visually stunning and imaginative but suffers from a predictable plot and 3D effects that feel sort of unnecessary.\nAlice (newcomer Mia Wasikowska) is now 19 years old and dreams nightly of her previous journey into Wonderland, but she has no memory of the actual visit. Her mother wants Alice to be married into a rich and powerful family, and at the beginning of the movie Alice and her mother appear at a posh to-do thrown by the parents of a snotty, dumb-looking suitor, who of course pops the question to her in front of a hundred simpering guests. But our Alice isn't ready for such a commitment to such a drip, so off she runs, comically falling down a hole in pursuit of the White Rabbit.\nOnce in Wonderland, Alice encounters several of the characters she met during her earlier visit: Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Cheshire Cat, the Blue Caterpillar, the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), the Dormouse, and the March Hare. It seems that the denizens of Wonderland have been awaiting Alice's return so that she can free them from the Red Queen's tyranny, something about a mystical calendar that prophesies Alice slaying the Jabberwocky. \nAs with most Burton films, this one is a real treat to watch. In fact, if you just turned the volume down and put your special glasses on, you'd be amazed at the jaw-dropping CGI. CGI gets a bad rap nowadays, as if it were always a short cut to actual acting. But here, I found the effects to be creative and wonderful to behold. Indeed, Bonham Carter and Depp have as much to do with their characters' personalities as the CGI does. \nIt might be that the movie doesn't lend itself very easily to 3D, but I think it's more likely that the script wasn't tailored quite enough to that technology. For example, the 3D Journey to the Center of the Earth, for all of its problems, was able to integrate 3D into the plot somewhat seamlessly, with boulders and birds alike flying toward the audience. Burton's Alice in Wonderland doesn't do that quite enough for the 3D to be really worthwhile. On the other hand, the pure animation of the movie is reminiscent of Coraline, and that's a very favorable comparison indeed. Wonderland here isn't meant to be some beautiful, pristine land; it's a land damaged by the touch of the bitter Red Queen, and you get a real sense of ominous peril.\nOn the plus side, the acting and voicing is really top notch. JOhnny Depp is always a lot of fun to watch, in my estimation, no matter how goofy his hair may be (and it's plenty odd here). Sure, he turns in the affected performance from time to time, like his Willy Wonka, but his Mad Hatter here is both vulnerable and heroic (something that perhaps Lewis Carroll hadn't envisioned). But Bonham Carter is absolutely stunning as the Red Queen. She manages to be both terrifying and hilarious at the same time. The Red Queen, full of vanity but desperate for acceptance, is at once the most charismatic character in the movie. \nAnother down side is that it seems to take forever and a day for Alice to even get to Wonderland. I think Burton spends a little too much time with the so-called outside world, at both the beginning and the end of the movie. What Alice's life is like outside Wonderland should be only of minimal importance to this story, I think. What matters to us is what happens to her in Wonderland, how she will persevere, who will she meet, and at which sizes will she be? It's helpful to know that Alice is about to be married to a selfish brat, but we don't need to spend 20 minutes on her outside-world situation.\nA final debit is that the movie operates on two tracks: one is a fantastic voyage replete with beautiful and amazing creatures and things, and the other is a standard-issue save-the-downtrodden heroine plot thread. The latter could have been scripted by any number of minimum-wage screenwriters. It reminded me of all of those movies in which some plucky hero or heroine fights all odds (as well as a lack of strength and wits) and somehow defeats the evil menace. Alice is no Lara Croft; she's not even a Red Sonja. She's just a teenager who's not even sure if she's dreaming or not.\nAlice in Wonderland does have its moments, but it tries to hard to mix a great children's story with a mythology and magic and kidnapping and revenge and other dark themes. And beware if you take children to see this. Even though it's a PG-rated movie, the film does contain a bit of violence, in particular a scene in which a baddie gets an eye plucked out."}

As a result, he finds his chances with a dreamy girl (Jennifer Garner) improve, but his life gets more complicated when he informs the world of the afterlife.\nMark Bellison writes for a company that produces lecture films, and Bellison's films haven't been entirely successful of late. Times are so bad that the company's president (Jeffrey Tambor) is about to fire Mark - if only he can gin up enough courage to tell him so. Mark's chief rival Brad Kessler (Rob Lowe), the firm's most popular writer, is always putting Mark down and trying to sabotage him at every turn. But none of that matters once Mark goes on a blind date with Anna (Garner), who's more interested in a mate who will be a good genetic match for her, thus helping her produce adorable, smart kids and not fat, snub-nosed kids but who agrees to date Mark only to get her gold-digging mother off her back.\nMeanwhile, Mark's mother takes seriously ill, and on her deathbed she becomes terribly afraid of what's about to happen to her - as we all would be here, in our reality-based world. Instead of telling his mother that he really has no idea what's to happen to her - which would, understandably, heighten her terror - Mark tells her that she's going to a better place, a place where she can have her own mansion and be happy all the time. And this little white lie might not have been much of an issue, but the hospital staff overhears Mark and leaps to the conclusion that he has some inside information on the afterlife.\nGervais is perfectly cast as the schlubby writer. Gervais is one of those actors who can come across either as an effete snob (like Dr. McPhee in Night at the Museum) or just an Everyman, and it's mainly because of his wonderful comic timing, which he perfected after years on BBC's original The Office; he's adept at playing the straight man or the condescending twit, in other words. (The man is a true wit; he also co-wrote, coproduced, and codirected this movie.) \nAnd he has a good cast to work with. Garner is appropriately cute, and she and Gervais make an excellent comic team. Anna is superficial, but no more so than anyone else in this fictional world. She's not intentionally mean. It's just that in that world, it's okay to tell your date that they don't really look great in that suit and that they aren't expecting to have a good time on their date. Lowe sort of mails it in as the oily Brad, but it's a role that fits him perfectly. Louis CK has a slight role as one of Mark's buddies; Jonah Hill, on the other hand, steals his scenes as Mark's downtrodden fellow tenant. There are also uncredited cameos by a couple of Oscar-nominated actors. Tina Fey makes a lot out of her tiny role as Mark's secretary - she's a real hoot.\nBut the movie has too many musical montages, which are generally used to pad out the running time of a weak movie. Montages like these don't further the plot and are simply boring - they're just a way to move things along with anything actually happening. In addition, there are a few moments in which the charm factor almost completely disappears, times when you're suddenly not so sympathetic toward Mark, times when there's an uneasy shift toward a more serious tone that simply feels out of place. And because the tone shifts so abruptly, it almost feels as if the movie isn't quite sure what it wants to be for a brief time before it lurches back to being a comedy of errors. And when it does THAT, even though the tone is more fitting, the plot falls into rut of predictability. Let's just say there's no twist ending.\nGervais is a very engaging comedic actor and has been for some time. This was the first feature he's directed, and it's not a bad freshman effort at all. It's just that the movie sort of jumps around a lot, unsure whether it wants to be sweet or sour. The good news is that the sweet parts are genuinely well done, and Gervais the actor does a great job of evoking sympathy for his plight, even when the situation is all his fault. The Invention of Lying is not without its charms, but its uneven pacing and attitude produce only sporadic - but sincere - laughs."}

The movie is slick but still terrifying, relying not only on wacked-out effects but also on unadulterated suspense to really rattle your nerves. \nAt a Little League game in Ogden Marsh, Iowa, a man wanders into the outfield carrying a shotgun. When the man raises the weapon, Sheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) shoots him dead. But the man wasn't drunk, he'd just gone crazy. Dutton investigates further, with the help of his deputy Russell (Joe Anderson), and discovers that a plane carrying a deadly cargo has crashed into a nearby creek, thus poisoning the town's drinking water.\nFrom there, events quickly get out of hand, as anyone who'd drunk water from their taps becomes first listless and unresponsive, then mumbly, then completely unhinged. But that's only the beginning of the nightmare for the town, which is then surrounded by a military force bent on containing the virus by any means necessary.\nThis is only kind of a zombie film. I mean, no one's dining on the flesh of their living compatriots, there's no shambling, and mindless killing. (There's plenty of killing, but the afflicted people still have the capacity for reason.) One thing I liked about this was that precious time isn't spend trying to discover the reason for everyone's behavior; attention is focused on the survivors and how they react to what's going on. I also appreciated that at no time does anyone, even the sheriff, have this superhuman ability to know what must be done and how to do it. Dutton isn't a superhero, he's a sheriff.\nAnother thing that helps a lot is the pacing. Too often, things either move so quickly that you can't figure out what's being done to whom or too slowly so that the suspense angle becomes the boredom angle. This is crucial for a horror film, which basically trafficks in suspense. Director Breck Eisner keeps the action coming without holding up the story (e.g., no drawn-out standoffs when it would look implausible), and there are plenty of creeping-up-on-you moments to choke twelve cows. \nOlyphant looks a lot like a younger Bill Paxton here, and he's a good fit - Sheriff Dutton is a solid leader, but he's not an improbable one. He's the kind of guy who rises to the occasion, not surpasses it completely. If you're looking for a movie where the hero is always armed to the teeth and subsequently never gets much more than a scratch on him, this isn't for you. Dutton has to constantly fight with his own instincts and change his attitude during the course of the movie (save everyone, save his wife, save a few people, save himself). \nPeople who make horror movies know they're making them for a pretty select audience. Lots of people don't like horror movies at all, and those who do are somewhat picky about them (particularly with so many big-budget ones from which to choose), so standards are high. It's important to grab that core audience, show them something they haven't seen or haven't seen done particularly well, then smack them upside the head. Classic horror films used the horror of the unseen to great effect, and more-recent genre films try the same thing. (One reason for this is that we've become inured to in-your-face slasher films, because the anticipation of the slasher doing his slashing has largely been eroded. But that's a digression right there.\nBasically, if zombie movies in general are your bag, you should love The Crazies. (If you don't like any horror films regardless, there's no way you should see this.) The Crazies is effectively scary, mixing human emotions with raw blood and gore and endless edge-of-your seat thrills."}

As he proceeds, Teddy Daniels uncovers far more than he bargained for - or is it? In a movie in which nearly everything is actually something else, the audience is redirected too many times for this to be an effective thriller, and some gaping holes in the plot should relegate this to the dustbin in no time.\nWe first see Marshal Daniels (Dicaprio) on the way to the island via ferry, with his partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo). Immediately, we size up our protagonist: prone to seasickness, a little grizzled, possibly wrestling with inner demons. Also has a prominent band-aid on his forehead, and as we all know any time a character shows up with a bandage and no explanation, that bandage will come into play later in the movie.\nThe asylum, Ashecliffe Hospital, is run by Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley), a pipe-smoking medical reformer who nonetheless looks down his nose at everyone else. His right-hand man is the assistant warden, McPherson (John Carroll Lynch), who informs the marshals that they must surrender their guns before they can enter the grounds. Again, something this obvious means that the concept will come up later in the movie, and sure enough it does.\nSomething doesn't quite add up about the missing patient, Rachel Solando. Solando apparently vanished from her room, barefoot, without anyone noticing, on an island. That is covered in rocky terrain. Daniels finds a note hidden under the floor tile that seems to indicate that there's an additional missing patient who's not accounted for. Further galivanting around the island simply unearths more and more facts and clues that don't make much sense. And then we find out that Daniels himself might be hiding something. He fits in very well with everyone else in this regard.\nThe movie is appropriately shot (by Robert Richardson, who's won two Oscars): moody, unflinching, terrifying at turns, well matched to the setting. But the movie has too many problems to be wholly satisfying. During the movie, one of the characters informs Daniels that being declared insane means that anything you do afterwards can be held up as evidence of your insanity. That makes sense, of course, but the trouble is that that logic can be applied to anything in this movie as well, a sort of self-justification. I Call it lazy screen writing.\nAnd, honest to goodness, I still don't think Leonardo Dicaprio is much of an actor. His matin\u00e9e-idol looks are already fading - he's got the head of Charlie Brown at this point - but his range hasn't really improved over the past decade or so. He seems to struggle with his reaction shots, and he doesn't have the gravitas necessary for such a heavy role. I'm supposed to believe he's a federal marshal? I'd have trouble believing he's dressed up as a marshal for Halloween. Here, he's supported by a very capable cast - particularly Kingsley, although he seems to be slumming it a bit, and Patricia Clarkson. But for the most part, his character is on his own, and Dicaprio flounders.\nShutter Island is, at best, minor Scorcese, a movie that's high on mood and atmosphere but a little light on a plausible plot. There are too many moments that don't make complete sense when they happen and that can only be supported by the notion that someone - or everyone - is insane."}

It's absolutely overflowing with tension as the selfless members of an elite bomb squad in Iraq are constantly besieged by conflict: from civilians, from unseen enemies, and among each other. Jeremy Renner, as the unit's new leader, is in particular fearless and unswerving, with a gutsy tenacity that shakes you to your core.\nThe Bravo Company is a bomb-disposal unit operating in Baghdad, Iraq. Sgt. William James arrives to head the group after its former leader, Sgt. Thompson, is killed in action. James quickly proves to be a man who moves to the beat of a different drummer, sometimes ignoring communiques from his fellow squad members, throwing caution to the wind. A freewheeling cowboy, James appears on the surface to be all rebellious bluster, but it soon becomes evident that his cockiness masks due caution and an almost unparalleled ability to remain cool under tremendous pressure.\nMake no mistake about it. War movies in the past have alternately shown soldiers as gung-ho blocks of wood or somewhat-vulnerable human beings, but few have shown how cool some true leaders can be when things get hot - physically and psychologically.\nPicture this: a car is afire in the middle of a town square. A bomb is feared to be inside. A soldier, part of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit, dons a heavy-protection suit and ambles to the fire. He extinguishes the fire with foam and then carefully opens the doors. Then methodically goes through every element of the car to find the bomb's triggering mechanism. This sound pressurized to begin with, doesn't it? Now picture that soldier surrounded by unseen assailants. There are only two other men on his team; their job is to provide cover for him, keeping their eyes and ears peeled for any suspicious activity. Could be that the young man on the neighboring rooftop isn't aiming a camera lens at the fire, he's aiming a gun. Or maybe he's signaling someone else, someone who has the actual trigger. And these aren't just people who are actual terrorists, it's also people who just plain don't want the Americans in their towns anymore.\nAs James' methodical madness saves the day again and again, his actions have varying effects on his mates. Sgt. Sanborn is a straight-arrow soldier who respects the rules of the game (i.e., he has no time for James' shenanigans), while young Spc. Eldridge seems to take a little more of a shine to his superior. In any case, there is also a side plot of a young boy whom James befriends. Is this boy as genuine as he seems (in his cynical exploitation of soldiers' DVD needs), or is he merely a tool in someone else's shed? One of the underlying messages of the movie is that the soldiers have virtually no one they can really trust; every innocent could be a bringer of death, no matter how young and no matter how fragile.\nBefore this movie, Kathryn Bigelow was probably best known for movies like Strange Days and Point Break. And being married to James Cameron, whose name you might recognize as well. Both of those movies were pretty solid action movies, but they owed a lot more to their stars - Ralph Fiennes and Patrick Swayze - than to their direction. But Bigelow easily trumps herself here, and possibly all of the movies to come out in 2009 (including a little picture by her ex, Cameron). The Hurt Locker is so well shot (by Barry Ackroyd) and directed that you feel as if you are mere yards away from every potential skull-shaking explosion. The movie is shot in almost a verite' style, so you feel like you're right on top of the action, something that's crucial for intense movies like this (and less so for comic-book action movies like Mission:Impossible).\nThe Hurt Locker is simply a masterful movie, filled with compelling drama and roaring action. It's never dull, even as our soldiers employ a bit of introspection among each other. It's sentimental but not overwrought; blink and you'll miss the theme of how all this stress affects the characters mentally. Most importantly, movie is packed with such tension that you'll be sweating in the safety of your living room (or theater), barely able to breathe until Sgt. James can disarm one of the many bombs in the movie. The Hurt Locker juxtaposes brutal violence with elegant, although intermittent, bouts of humanity (and not just by the soldiers). It's utterly compelling, fascinating, and highly entertaining, and it's got a great chance to win Best Picture next month."}

Not really meant to be an uplifting movie anyway, this adaptation of an Alice Sebold novel is almost relentlessly depressing, overbearing, maudlin, and dull. It's a movie that demands considerable emotional investment, but it takes too long to reach its conclusion, leaving you cold when you should be concerned.\nThe movie opens shortly before Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) is killed by a creepy neighbor (Stanley Tucci) in 1973 and then finds her stuck in limbo while her family deals with the tragedy. She is also keeping an eye on Mr. Harvey, her killer, in the hopes that someone will catch him and find her body. But just so you're aware, this is not a murder mystery, since we know almost immediately who the killer is; it's a melodrama about how people cope with loss.\nSo there's very little intrigue to be found, and every little plot development seems to exist merely to move things along to some undefined conclusion with which you may or may not agree. Dad Jack (Mark Wahlberg) copes by lashing out (at items he built with his daughter, not at his family); mom Abigail (Rachel Weisz) opts for escape; sister Lindsey (Rose McIver) escapes as well, out of Susie's shadow. Even Abigail's mother, Grandma Lynn (Susan Sarandon) shows up to lend a hand to a family reeling - the fact that she's a chain-smoking, liquor-swilling wild woman gives everyone a jolt, but it's just not enough.\nCritics have said that Sebold's novel is probably unfilmable, and they're right. Director Peter Jackson uses some startling visual imagery, but it's really nothing noteworthy (and, truth be told, What Dreams May Come, which covered some of the same subject matter, was far more visually interesting); worse, everything feels jammed in, a square peg desperately trying to fit into a round hole.\nBut worse than that, for me, was the interminable, uncomfortable scene in which Susie is abducted by Mr. Harvey. There seemed to be no good reason to drag this interaction out as much as Jackson did, other than to make everyone squeamish. Since the thrust of the movie was the Salmon family's reaction - and Susie's experiences in the afterlife - showing us a drawn-out attack scene felt gratuitous and had me eyeing the exit signs.\nAs for the cast, Wahlberg and Weisz try their best but are overshadowed by the constant shots of Ronan attempting to convey an emotion of some sort. Ronan, who was terrible in Atonement and mildly improved in City of Ember, is given little to do other than look pitiful. Sarandon chews scenery as a vamping lush of a grandma. The only one who shines is Tucci, who's almost unrecognizable as the bespectacled blonde killer.\nPeter Jackson's The Lovely Bones is stylish but insubstantial. While the effects are fun to look at and feel full of meaning and import, the story and acting feel almost tacked on as an afterthought. This is problematic when the movie relies heavily on the story to begin with, because it makes the low-key character-driven scenes look even worse in comparison."}

A 1000-year-old man (Christopher Plummer), having made a deal with the devil (Tom Waits) must gather five souls through the use of his unique mirror or risk losing his daughter (Lily Cole) to Mr. Nick. Then an amnesiac (Ledger) encounters the old man and his troupe, setting off a chain of events that promises to either save Dr. Parnassus or doom him further. The entire cast is outstanding, and Ledger himself is superb, but they're almost overshadowed by the entrancing visual design of the film, with epic, jaw-dropping set pieces and surreal cinematography.\nParnassus runs a midway-type show from the back of a large wagon in London. His show features a man dressed up as Mercury, who introduces the good doctor; a lovely young lass, who ushers the customer into the mirror; and a dwarf, who aids and abets. But the show isn't received very warmly by the Londoners who drift into its orbit, in the periphery of rundown carnivals and decrepit shops, and Dr. Parnassus is soon visited by Old Scratch himself. The two, who long ago made a deal that bestowed immortality on Parnassus, make a new wager: if the good doctor can claim five souls (with his magical mirror) in two days' time, his debt to the devil will be met; if not, Mr. Nick can claim Valentina, Parnassus' daughter.\nMeanwhile, a stranger stumbles into their midst; a young man with strange markings on his head is rescued from hanging beneath a bridge. This young man - philanthropist Tony - infuses the troupe with a sudden burst of energy and retools the show to appeal to a more upscale audience. But at what cost? Those who enter the Imaginarium inevitably exit with a sense of euphoria and a real desire to give prodigiously, as long as they follow the rules. Rules such as no unauthorized admittance and only one customer at a time. You see, when one enters the Imaginarium, one enters one's own imagination, and when one doesn't have permission to be in the Imaginarium, one experiences an unhappy ending. And when two people enter, their imaginations overlap, causing chaos and pandemonium.\nLedger died unexpectedly during the filming of this movie, of course, and his death left director Terry Gilliam with a decision to make. He could scrap the movie, recast the part, or perhaps retool the part. Gilliam chose the latter. At a few points during the film, Ledger's Tony enters the Imaginarium when he shouldn't have, and doing so changes his appearance dramatically. The first time, he becomes Johnny Depp; then, he's Jude Law; finally, he's Colin Farrell. (All three actors donated their salaries to Ledger's young daughter, Matilda.) It's usually not a good idea to use a new actor in an established role (see Plan Nine from Outer Space, for example), but it certainly isn't easy to explain why your leading man suddenly looks different. Gilliam's clever script modification makes perfect sense.\nIt is the magic of movies that always brings me back for more. When I go to the theater, I'm looking for something astounding, beautiful, captivating, real and surreal, delicious, and overall creative. The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus recalls many of Gilliam's earlier works, particularly 1989's The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (minus the whiny British girl), and his own imagination has never looked so fluid, cohesive, and downright gorgeous. But lest you think that all I liked about this movie was the look, fret not - it's exceedingly well acted, with pitch-perfect work from Cole, Plummer, Waits, and all of the Tonys, especially, the late, great Ledger. Exquisitely detailed, with passion in every second of every shot and in every inch of each set."}

Filmed on a shoestring budget, the movie is at turns terrifying, mysterious, and electrifying, and it\u2019s probably not a movie you want to watch alone and in the dark.\nMicah (Micah Sloat) and Katie (Katie Featherston) have been experiencing some sort of phenomena in their new home. Apparently, though, this has been happening to Katie for years, since she was about eight years old. As the phenomena prevent the couple from having a good night\u2019s sleep, Micah purchases a hand-held videocamera so they can try to solve their problem.\nThey wind up getting more than they bargained for. The events worsen, and tension mounts. Neither Micah nor Katie can get much sleep, if any, and the pressure quickly begins to take its toll. They even consult a psychic, who advises them to call a demonologist (really); however, by the time they actually call the demonologist, he\u2019s out of town \u2013 and the psychic can no longer help them.\nYour mileage may vary, certainly, but I found this movie to be extremely unsettling. It is not a pleasant movie to watch, even by horror-thriller standards. Some of you may know that I\u2019ve seen a lot of movies, and some of you may also know that includes many horror-thriller movies. Often, these movies aren\u2019t particularly well done \u2013 they don\u2019t have a strong plot or decent actors and rely instead on effects for shock value. Paranormal Activity brings the shock and terror by following a very simple formula, one that works very often in horror films: keep most of the terror offscreen, and your audience will be frightened. It\u2019s what you can\u2019t see that\u2019ll do you the most damage.\nIn a neat, effective trick, director Oren Peli shows everything through the lens of the newly acquired videocamera, which lends quite the sense of truth and sincerity to the proceedings. So when the camera is on the nightstand, with the handy timestamp in the lower corner of the screen, we can see for ourselves what horrors await the somewhat-slumbering couple. We see what they see, which just adds to the unfettered panic. You start to believe you\u2019re right there in the room, and that whatever is attacking Micah and Katie will come after you next.\nParanormal Activity works because of its low budget and streamlined approach. If you\u2019re not able to buy in to the whole idea of being scared \u2013 if you\u2019re the kind of person who thinks of horror films as things to be laughed at \u2013 you won\u2019t likely enjoy this one to its fullest. The movie has a slow 30 minutes or so at the beginning, but once things get moving, look out!"}

The characters are one dimensional, both as written and as portrayed, and there's hardly anything unpredictable. The only thing this movie has going for it are its state-of-the-art effects, which are truly boggling.\nSam Worthington plays Jake, a paraplegic ex-Marine who's sent to a distant moon to help humans mine a mineral called unobtainium (in the running for the least creative chemical name ever). Seems there's a huge cache of the stuff under a huge tree in a jungle that's populated by an indigenous race called the Na'vi, blue-skinned, really tall people with feline characteristics. Meanwhile, a scientific program headed by Grace Augustine (played by a typically stiff Sigourney Weaver) has focused on learning as much as possible about the Na'vi in order to benefit scientific knowledge. Augustine's research (funded by the same company who's mining the unobtainium) involves the use of avatars, in which scientists form a psychological link with a mock-up that looks just like a native Na'Vi, the better for the humans to exist within the unbreathable atmosphere. Jake gets inside the Na'vi within his avatar and attempts to find out what they would want in exchange for moving from away from the giant store of unobtainium; during the course of his mission, he falls for the Na'vi chief's daughter, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). (Of course he does.) And as said mission drags on, Jake's perspective changes from meathead jerk to tree-loving jerk, and he begins to wonder if what he's doing is right.\nIs he serious? You're an alien race (humans) and have no business on this moon. Your employer's stated goal is to gobble up all the jewels he can find, basically raping the planet. Your employer will stop at nothing to get it, as he answers to no one. You're being sent down to find a diplomatic way to screw the natives out of the bounty on which they sit. And he thinks this might be wrong? A power grab ensues when the military leader of the human expedition, a Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) decides enough is enough and wants to bomb the hell out of the Na'vi, with the approval of the head of the company, Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi), another patently obvious name. This sets up the rather obvious showdown between the primitive Na'vi and the gung-ho ex-Marine humans, who have missiles and guns and ammo and rockets and helicopters and who knows, even a Star Destroyer or two. The final battle scene is overtly reminiscent of the Battle of Endor in Return of the Jedi, in which the primitive Ewoks manage to defeat a stormtrooper army using only their quick wits and some old-school, homemade traps of destruction.\nBut even if the plot doesn't need to be complex, it sure ought to make sense. Here's a nonspoiler question to ponder. Jake, under the guise of his avatar, is taken in by the Na'vi, whose spiritual leader asks Neytiri to teach Jake their ways. Why this is to be is not terribly clear. It's evident that the humans have made several attempts at learning the ways of the Na'vi but that prior emissaries had been scientists; as soon as Jake tells the Na'vi that he's a warrior, they're all about teaching him. I don't quite follow the logic here; if I were the Na'vi and had not been able to teach the smart humans who obviously (to me) were not there to do me harm, why in the world would I want to teach someone who's used to using aggression and violence to solve problems? I get that the Na'vi, as a warrior race, would relate more to the soldier, but surely they would be reluctant to share knowledge with someone who was outside of their group anyway, let alone with one who might well do them harm.\nMoreover, I'm not sure what the Na'vi thought Jake was, really. He looked like them, through his avatar, but they referred to him at least once as an alien. My best guess is that they just thought he was from another clan. Other clan? I'll assume that only this one clan, the Omaticaya, made its home at Hometree (yet another clumsy naming convention) and therefore was the only clan with a stake in protecting it. But if they simply thought Jake was from another clan, why did they let him in anyway? Why did they teach him? What purpose would it serve them? And on top of that, since the Omaticaya mentioned being approached by \"aliens\" before, doesn't it seem more likely that they would have assumed Jake was another alien ambassador anyway? This makes my brain hurt.\nI think it's pretty obvious that Cameron wanted this to be his own Star Wars, an epic taking place on a distant world. He uses the standard Cameron recipe of astounding special effects and innovation coupled with a weak plot and laughable characters and hopes it all comes out okay (although for a movie that gestated for more than a decade, that's simplifying things a bit). The effects, it should be noted, are really mesmerizing visuals of the jaw-dropping variety. The 3D effects were unbelievable, and I mean that in a good way. Avatar is extraordinarily shot, using 60% CGI and 40% live action, and the two elements are flawlessly intertwined. It's a remarkable film.\nBut it's only part of a film. the entire movie seems to try pretty hard to keep some emotional distance from its audience, and when a film is emotionally uninvolving, it's lost the battle for your heart.\nAnd that's the core problem. Despite some wonderful, beautiful effects, Avatar gives us characters in whom we can't really get invested, and when a key element of your story is an interspecies romance, this is a crucial, fatal flaw."}

Here he plays an effete high schooler named Nick Twisp who thinks he's found the girl of his dreams during a lakefront vacation. Only to get the girl he needs to man up and become more dangerous, so he invents a subpersona named Francois, a dashing lad full of derring-do. This black comedy has plenty of laughs amid a wacky, absurdist atmosphere.\nNick Twisp. Great name for a fictional character; terrible name for a real person, I would think. Nick is into Frank Sinatra, his computer, and classic prose; he lives with his trailer-trash mom (Jean Smart) and her ne'er-do-well current boyfriend (played with laid-back zeal by Zach Galifianakis). Nick is as stammery as any other Michael Cera character, and his approach to the fairer sex is, unsurprisingly, ineffective.\nThings look up when he meets neighbor Sheeni Saunders (Portia Doubleday, who is both enigmatic and ebullient as Sheeni), who's gorgeous and fun to be with. It's not long before Nick decides Sheeni's the one for him. But it's quickly revealed that Sheeni already has a boyfriend, a real manly man named Trent. How can anyone played by Michael Cera compete with a guy named Trent? Easy \u2013 by inventing an alter ego that gives voice to his rampaging id, a rogueish cad named Francois (because Sheeni loves French things). Francois allows Nick to do and say things that he'd never otherwise say.\nAnd that's when things really take off. The pleasure of this movie is twofold. First, Cera's delivery and the script by Gustin Nash go together like Forrest Gump and Jenny. The jokes are often laugh-out-loud quality, and it's at least partly due to Cera's sometimes-mumbled, frightened-rabbit replies. His funny lines are played straight, and somehow it works. Second, the absurd escalating situations in which Nick finds himself \u2013 as a result of his own actions, it should be noted \u2013 are funny the same way Mr. Creosote's predicament was funny in Monty Python's The Meaning of Life. The stuff Nick does at the behest of Francois to win Sheemi's heart are hilarious yet unlikely \u2013 and yet they ring true nonetheless.\nIt also helps that Cera is supported by some damn funny actors: Galifianakis is a hoot in a somewhat dark role; Steve Buscemi plays Nick's dad with vulgar intensity (as if he were a domesticated version of Mr. Pink); Justin Long, of all people, is Sheeni's stoner older brother; M. Emmett Walsh (who's perhaps a tad too old to be the father of a teen) is Sheeni's dad; Mary Kay Place is the mom; Smart as Nick's mom; and Adhir Kalyan as a fellow student who helps Nick in his quest for Sheeni. Oh, and Fred Willard as a neighbor who likes to save illegal immigrants from the INS.\nI know the word \"quirky\" is overused for oddball comedies today, particularly those starring Michael Cera (who, if he plays another Nick, may as well dot his face with bloodied pieces of tissue paper), but this one outquirks most of them. Even with all the madness zooming around this film, at the heart of things is the love between a girl and a boy and the lengths either will go to protect that bond. This movie should appeal to those who like offbeat romances."}

Only a predictable final twenty minutes or so prevents the movie from being a bittersweet classic.\nRyan is what you call a real frequent flyer; he's the proud owner of millions of miles in the air and scores of elite-status cards and chotchkies. His company sends him to other companies for the sole purpose of letting go staff, rather than having the senior staff do it. (Wussies.) Anyway, it pays very well, but Ryan's on the road over 250 days a year. But he gets star treatment literally everywhere, so it all works out okay.\nHowever, Ryan's boss (played by an oily Jason Bateman) wants to try something a little different. A newcomer to the team, Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), has the bright idea of firing people remotely. This way road warriors like Ryan could stay at home, thus saving the company travel expenses. Bateman likes it, Clooney's Ryan does not \u2013 and why would he? He'd lose all the perks of traveling, probably lose a lot of salary, and have to deal with real life for a change. He pitches enough of a fit that boss Bateman sends him back on the road \u2013 with Natalie. You know, to show her the ropes.\nWhich actually brings us to one of the more poignant parts of the film. We see Ryan lowering the boom on senior management and junior staffers alike, and their reactions (from acting calmly to pouring bleach in the coffee). Reitman actually brought in people who had just lost their jobs, so their reactions are more are less genuine (they were instructed to react either as they actually did when informed of losing their jobs or how they wish they had reacted). The theme couldn't be more timely, with the American economy doing so poorly and so many people out of work. Ryan has to deliver the news professionally and implacably, something that the straightlaced Natalie cannot always do.\nA secondary thread has to do with Ryan's relationships, those with his family and those with, well, other people in general. His sister is getting married, but he's so self-absorbed that he can't find time to care much about it. Then Ryan meets cute with a fellow traveler in an airport bar (Vera Farmiga) and falls in lust with what he sees as a kindred spirit.\nThat's another important theme here, really: the perceived isolation in which Ryan finds himself. Sure, he's surrounded by people all the time, but he has intentionally never pursued any kind of meaningful relationship, choosing instead to put more stock in the elite status that million-mile travelers get.\nYou might think that because Natalie is on the road with Ryan, the two will inevitably hook up. But this is a more-mature look at relationships than Hollywood is used to churning out. Typically, you'd expect physical sparks to fly, because Clooney is Clooney and age differences mean little in Hollywood if we're talking an older man and a younger woman. But both Kendrick and Clooney are lights-out amazing; Kendrick in particular is tremendously effective as the inexperienced go-getter. Natalie is certainly not perfect, but she's also not a one-dimension prude, either. In fact, the scenes in which she explains herself \u2013 whether it's to a group of downsizers or to Ryan himself \u2013 are where the picture truly shines. Kendrick's artful delivery evokes both sympathy and envy for Natalie, who's in her situation of her own volition and accord.\nAnd you might also think that because Alex (Farmiga) and Ryan meet on the road and have some fun that their relationship will immediately dissolve into a pool of boring. It's not so. Farmiga \u2013 a largely unknown quantity to me \u2013 was fantastic, playing Alex neither as another conquest for the Ryan Express nor as the kind of woman who will settle down with someone forever and ever. In fact, she's more than a match for Clooney in the charm department.\nThe movie loses its way, slightly, near the end, when a twist arrives with as little subtlety as possible. You'll probably be able to spot the plot change from a mile away. That's about the only thing that keeps this from being a superb movie, a sagging denouement, but certainly the three standout performances are nothing to be sneezed at."}
< {"rating": "10", "date": "12 December 2009", "title_id": "tt1057500", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "Inspirational", "content": "Clint Eastwood manages to top himself with this true story of how the new president of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, used the national rugby team foray into the World Cup to unite his country after years of apartheid. Eastwood\u2019s soft touch provides a timely but not heavy-handed message about hope and change that probably won\u2019t be lost on American audiences. The result is beautiful, exhilarating, and wholly inspirational.\nMandela, played with effortless dignity by Morgan Freeman, is fresh out of prison and desperate for a way to rebuild his country, which has been torn asunder by the heinous policies of apartheid. Mandela comes to believe that the most sensible way for this to be accomplished is not by making speeches in faraway lands but to give his countrymen something they can all cheer about. His solution is to galvanize the national rugby team, which to date had not been a particularly successful club and had been given very little chance to compete on an international stage like the World Cup. Mandela pins all of his political hopes on the club\u2019s chances; should they fail, he will appear to have behaved frivolously in paying so much attention to a sport, and the black people and the white people would be even farther apart.\nThe odds were decidedly against the Springboks of South Africa. The team was a certified failure, so much so that the coach had just been axed. Captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) is frustrated. Times are so bad in South Africa that during the team\u2019s matches, the white audience members cheer for South Africa \u2013 but the black audience members cheer for the opposition, because the team itself is almost entirely white, with only one black player. Indeed, after Mandela\u2019s election as president, South African groups vote overwhelmingly to drop the traditional rugby nickname \u201cSpringboks\u201d as a way to shed themselves of all reminders of the apartheid era. Mandela realizes that such a action would instead drive a further wedge between the two races, so he countermands the local votes and maintains the nickname and the traditional green-and-gold uniforms.\nSports movies in general are expected to follow a particular formula, more so than other films. That is, if we\u2019re met with a ragtag band of sandlot players, we expect them to somehow persevere by the end of the movie. This is one of the few genres in which such predictability is a major plus. Sports movies are meant to manipulate you shamelessly, and you\u2019re a willing, permissive participant. Invictus certainly plucks all the heartstrings it can, but the bonus is that these events actually happened. This isn\u2019t The Mighty Ducks beating the bad guys or Henry Rowengartner\u2019s Cubs winning the World Series, this is a real-life rugby team gaining strength, wisdom, and inspiration from their newly elected president to triumph over steep odds.\nThat said, this is less a movie about winning the championship and more about unification. Mandela, who had been imprisoned for 27 years, had steep odds of his own to contend with. Although democratically elected, there were still plenty of people throughout the country who really didn\u2019t trust their new leader at all and were convinced that he would lead them all to ruin. (Sounds a little familiar, and I assume that the timing was intentional on the part of Eastwood.) Mandela had to unite everyone, beginning with his own staff, in order for the country to move forward and have a seat at the proverbial international table.\nBecause of this grand vision, Mandela takes a personal interest in the fortunes of the rugby team, even to the point of rescheduling events so that he can watch the matches either in person or at least on television. He is careful not to intrude too much in the training and management of the team (particularly Pienaar).\nNow, granted, this is an American movie made for American audiences, so there are some concessions. For one thing, the rules of rugby have to be mentioned at least once (and not enough, as far as I was concerned); for another, the focus isn\u2019t just on the political machinations and aspirations of Mandela but rather on how the team itself reacts to its new success and the attempts by its captain to inspire them to ever-greater heights. What this slight sleight of hand does is present the idea of postpartheid attitudes in the framework of an athletic event, something American audiences can always care about, no matter the sport. Excellent decision by the director, I think, because the overall message is enhanced, rather than obscured, by the experiences of the Springboks.\nEven with the political subtext, and even among sports movies (which themselves are usually very evocative), this is a highly emotional film. The rugby scenes are so well done, so fantastic to watch, that nonfans like me \u2013 who don\u2019t know a thing about rugby \u2013 can\u2019t help but let down their steely resolve and cynicism. This is a happy, optimistic movie, but it\u2019s not a funny movie. There was hardly a dry eye in the theater today, thanks to the powerful rugby scenes, and I have to admit I haven\u2019t teared up that much at any movie in a long, long time. Eastwood\u2019s strong direction pushes the audience into the right direction, but we go willingly and happily. Freeman is commanding in the role he was always meant to play (Mandela himself wanted Freeman to portray him), and even Damon is excellent as the South African rugby captain. This is a true winner in all aspects of film."}

Joe could have been much worse. Sure, it's filled with clich\u00e9s and implausibilities and the acting is on par with a jelly sandwich, but the story is easy to follow and the special effects are fairly special. Neat gadgetry, too.\nMovies like this really get a bad rap sometimes, because they are simply slightly controlled chaos. So of course, the bar is set pretty low for these movies. The plot here feels like it's been lifted from the remnants of a James Bond treatment, only they hacked out all the thinky stuff and went with more blowy-uppy stuff. Not that there's anything wrong with that.\nIn fact, one thing this movie has going for it is its simplicity of design. Bad guy steals weapons, good guys chase him to the ends of the earth, good guys save the day, bad guy shakes fist angrily and vows revenge. I mean, you can't get much more straightforward than that, can you? Oh, sure, there are some twists thrown in to surprise you a little bit, but they don't surprise so much as give you something else to think about for perhaps a nanosecond. Bad guys remain bad guys, good guys remain good guys, love interests remain in place so you can ogle them. That sort of thing.\nA quick glance at the plot: a weapons dealer has created four warheads that can wipe out an entire city...and they've been stolen! The Man who Would Become Cobra Commander might be behind it, as might Destro (said arms dealer). And it's up to the Joes, led by General Hawk (Dennis Quaid), to retrieve them. Two of the soldiers who let the warheads get away, Duke and Ripcord, join the Joes (yes, here they're rookies, not the veterans from the TV series), but it seems that Duke (Channing Tatum) has a past with the evil Baroness (Sienna Miller), and there's one of your love-interest connections. The other one is that Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) has the hots for Scarlett (Rachel Nichols), the brains of the outfit. That's not saying much in this movie, but trust me, she are smart.\nBut above all else, it's the effects you came to see, and they deliver. We're well past the point where the effects have more personality than the actors, so it's not really a debit. The effects here are awe inspiring, even on a small TV screen. I mean, where else would you see an invisibility coat? Oh, wait, Harry Potter, right. Okay, but they do have these neat suits that allow the wearer to run really fast and jump really high and smash really hard, as if they were all made out of Hulk Hands.\nSo what the movie lacks in terms of such niceties as character development and a logical plot it makes up for with genuinely exhilarating effects that make you feel as if you're right there in the cockpit, or in the submarine, or in the secret lair, or even just roaming the streets of Paris in your robot suit."}

I can\u2019t get enough of the adventures of Manny and Sid and Diego, even as their \u201cherd\u201d continues to grow. Each of the movies is a lot of fun to watch, with just enough sweet scenes to balance things out.\nThis time around, Manny and Ellie (Ray Romano and Queen Latifah) are expecting, and of course Manny\u2019s a nervous father to be. But that\u2019s not all \u2013 the group dynamic is starting to shift in other ways as well. First, Diego (Denis Leary) is starting to feel old and in the way; second, Sid (John Leguizamo) is actually getting in the way of Manny\u2019s well-laid plans. But like with the first couple of movies, what brings everyone together is a journey. This time around, Sid is accidentally snatched by a giant T-rex, whose eggs he had been, er, watching. And the race is on to find and rescue Sid in what\u2019s apparently a dinocentric world right under our friends\u2019 icy land.\nThe visuals are stunning. Sweeping vistas of whites and blues when the gang is at home, and vibrant hues of browns, greens, and darker blues in the land of the dinosaurs. Computer animation has gotten to the point where the movies have the same level of quality as the early Disney cel animation films. The Ice Age films are wonderfully rendered, from those stunning backgrounds to the detailed expressions of the characters.\nI do hope, though, that the Ice Age films (if more are made) don\u2019t fall into the same rut that befell the Land before Time series. There have now been thirteen LBT movies! Of course, only the first one was in theaters, but you get my drift. Let\u2019s not see Ice Age XX: The Search for the Great Wisdom Tree or some such fluff. Now, each of the Ice Age films has been in theaters, and although none of them has been an instant classic, each has been charming fun, and the quality has not deteriorated over the films.\nSo in essence, the latest Ice Age film maintains the high fun quotient of its predecessors without lapsing into schmaltz or too-broad physical humor. I mean, it IS a kids\u2019 film, after all, so there\u2019s plenty of physical humor to be found, but the comedy isn\u2019t based solely on pain and suffering."}

Turns out that a not-beardy Seth Rogen is horribly unfunny, or maybe he's just a terrible actor, or maybe he's just not good in movies not produced by Judd Apatow. I think this was supposed to be funny, but it's just awful, filled with cringe-worthy moments and terrible comic timing.\nRonny (Rogen) is the head of security at a suburban shopping mall. His day is spent ogling Anna Faris, who plays a cosmetics salesgirl, and lording his authority over his misfit fellow security cops. He is a complete and utter jerk to everyone, and not in the pompous-ass way, either. He is a truly rotten person. Oh, but he probably gets redemption somewhere down the road, right? Seriously, there's an entire freaking scene - five minutes or so - that consists mostly of Ronny and a minority vendor telling each other, \"F--- you.\" \"F--- you.\" \"No, f--- you.\" \"No, f--- you.\" Honest to god, that's all they did.\nAnyway, the thrust of the story is that there's a flasher who's been prowling the mall. Ronny, all swagger and whatnot, overzealously pursues the case, but when the flasher continues to strike, the real cops are called in, in the person of Ray Liotta. Detective Harrison (Liotta) puts up with Ronny's crap for a day and then blows up at him. Because, you see, Ronny is not a cop.\nUndaunted, the moronic mall cop blusters into the cop recruitment center and applies to be a policeman. One of the tests to be a cop, apparently, is that the applicant can go on a ridealong with a real cop. And guess who this nitwit chooses. Payback! Hilarity does not ensue. Harrison takes Ronny out in the middle of the projects and leaves him there. Within seconds, a gang is all up in Ronny's grill, and he has no gun! What will he do! Well, he beats the stuffing out of all four of them with his nightstick, I am not making this up at all.\nRonny then goes to Police Academy! Woo! Montage of Ronny hurtling hurtles and stuff. Not funny and pointless. (Is he doing this while he's supposed to be protecting Anna Faris from the flasher? Good god this movie stinks.) I'm at a loss to explain why anyone would like this movie. It's easily the worst film Rogen's ever done, and it's not as if he's the only good part in a horrendous movie. He's the nadir of disaster here. He's at ground zero. He is unspeakably bad. Seth Rogen can't scream and curse and be funny all the time, apparently; sometimes he's just your average redneck jackass. His Ronny is incredibly stupid, but his stupidity is not played for laughs, really, because he's a mean creep. Seriously, he's allegedly smitten with Faris' character, but it's clear all he wants to do is get in her pants. Know how I know that? Because he also hits on the lame (physically) coffee-shop chick, even though she's \"married to God.\" Oh, I also know it because - and this is in the trailer, the previews, and every lamebrain commercial for this movie, ever - he takes advantage of Anna Faris after the latter passes out drunk. It's a horrifying, unfunny scene. Yikes. A comedy, folks! Oh, and did I mention he's bipolar? Of course he is. I guess that's supposed to excuse his crappy behavior, or something. We're supposed to feel sorry for him! Criminey and jeepers, every time you think the movie couldn't possibly stink more, it gets worse and worse. We have Ronny the Super Mall Cop using a TASER on an unarmed man. Timely theme, sure, but again - he's supposed to be the good guy. Holy crap.\nObserve and Report is wildly offensive and staggeringly unfunny. Rogen is seriously miscast as a colossal jerk and pervert who abuses his meager power as a mall security guard. The violence is unseemly and obscene. There's so much anger and viciousness and bitterness in Rogen's attitude that you don't laugh at him, you cringe when he's on screen. This is a hopeless, utter waste of time."}

Given how cheesy movies of the period were, it's somewhat surprising that Alien Trespass turns out to have quite a bit of panache and credulity to go with its faithful look at a quieter, simpler time.\nSet in 1957, the movie follows the effect that the arrival of the alien marshal Urp (Marshal Urp, get it?) has on the populace. Shortly after his ship crashes \u2013 and his prisoner escapes \u2013 Urp assumes the body of a local scientist, Dr. Lewis (Eric McCormack) and sets about finding his prey, a Ghota \u2013 a beast with one eye and huge tentacles who kills. And turns invisible! In fact, the Ghota looks a lot like Kang and Kodos from The Simpsons, but I digress.\nSome kids necking (hee hee) at Lover's Lane or Lookout Point or Inspiration Point see the crash, and when they investigate they're attacked by the monster. But naturally, the police don't believe them or their seedy looking greaser pal (told you it was set in the fifties). Meanwhile, Marshal Urp, in the doctor's body, is stealing cars and trying to, uh, blend in.\nOne of the scenes \u2013 no spoilers here \u2013 takes places in a movie theater while the kids are watching The Blog. Yes, the one with Steve McQueen, where he himself is a kid trying to warn a small town about a gelatinous monster! And of course, while everyone's watching this movie, the real monster attacks.\nI have to admit that I had pretty low expectations for this movie. It's set in the 1950s, the apex of cheesiness. It's got a cheesy title. It has no recognizable stars, other than Dan Lauria (The Wonder Years) and Robert Patrick (Terminator 2). You can't expect Close Encounters with that sort of lineup. But Alien Trespass has something that movies like Plan 9 from Outerspace and, more recently, The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra wish they had: a heart. Endearing, winning performances by Jenni Baird (as the waitress who helps Urp) and McCormack help lift this above the usual low-budget ennui."}

The best of the lot have combined suspense with cutting-edge effects to keep your adrenaline pumping. The worst combine cheesy CGI with shallow characters whose deaths won't affect you much.\nHere's 2012, summed up: Look, some recognizable landmark! Kablam! Look, a giant wave! Wooo! Do our intrepid Good Guys have enough time to outrun the imploding planet and foil a plot to save only the pretty, rich people? Probably! It's pretty clear what happened to bring us to this point. Roland Emmerich, who's made such cinematic classics as Independence Day, The Patriot, Godzilla, and The Day after Tomorrow, was asked if he wanted a quintillion billion bazillion dollars to make a movie about the end of the world, and he said sure. Then he took parts of each movie's script, filmed them mostly with CGI, and pocketed the rest. Viola! Greatest movie! (A quick break to sum up the plot. Apparently, the sun and the planets have all aligned with the center of the galaxy, which winds up causing the Earth's crust to break up, which then causes the tectonic plates to shift. Mass hysteria! Dogs and cats, living together! The End.) See, there are two ways Emmerich could have gone with this movie. He could have given us characters to follow whom we cared a little about, thus involving us in their plights, and mixed in some convincing special effects. Or he could have said, \"The heck with the characters, give me blowy-uppy thingys.\" This sometimes works: See Independence Day, a movie that made me feel pretty good when I left the theater after seeing it but that ultimately, frankly, was pretty bad.\nEmmerich chose the latter. Which would have been fine, but the effects themselves are wildly unrealistic and often take so long to set up that you completely notice how godawful they really are. For example \u2013 and if you've seen the trailer, this is in there \u2013 there's a scene in which the Sistine Chapel falls, crushing thousands of spectators. Because the toppling is so slow to complete, it becomes painfully obvious that it's just a film running on a screen behind people running away. Sad and unintentionally hilarious.\nAnd you can forget about the plot, really, because most of it makes no sense anyway and would happen only in a Big Movie like this. Of COURSE John Cusack is divorced from his hot, bitchy wife (Amanda Peet) and of COURSE she's hooking up with a plastic surgeon who of COURSE winds up having had some flying lessons that of COURSE will save them all and of COURSE Cusack's young son will somehow save the day as well and of COURSE there is a Russian businessman who used to be a boxing legend and of COURSE he punches someone out. And of COURSE people say \"My God!\" a lot, because that's what people do in crappy disaster films. And of COURSE the president is black, because in Hollywood black people get to be president only if disaster is a-coming.\nAt least the acting isn't horrible. Because everyone just runs from place to place in an effort to escape the horror, there aren't any subtle, low-key scenes that would allow good actors to flourish. Cusack is good in general, but what the heck is he doing in here? He's usually so good at picking projects, and he chose this? Willingly? Oliver Platt plays the kind of role that Bruce McGill typically gets, the hamhanded, I'm-in-charge, Al-Haig-like politician. I can't even remember his title. Danny Glover gets to be president and does get the best dialog in the film, even if his role isn't a big one. Woody Harrelson, as a crazed DJ deep in Yellowstone is also a lot of fun, although he's not the kind of guy you'd want to sit next to on a transatlantic flight.\nFinal verdict: Yikes. Yikes, yikes, and yikes. If you dare watch this travesty, you might find yourself laughing hysterically at things \u2013 and this is important \u2013 that were not meant to be funny. If that's your thing, this is your movie. I managed to see this as a matin\u00e9e, so I'm not out the $10-$15 that some people are right now, so at least I got that going for me. Best advice: Watch it for free at home on a big-screen TV to fully appreciate the magnitude of suck."}

I didn't care for it too much, but what did I expect, with a title like that? The makers of that gem offered, somewhat illogically, to send me a copy of their earlier work, Freaky Farley, a movie about a creepy Peeping Tom who gets mixed up with a spirited lass while chafing under the control of his domineering dad.\nYou don't see many movies in which a Peeping Tom is sort of the good guy. Farley Wilder (writer-producer Matt Farley) is the weird guy in your neighborhood who spends his time walking in the woods or hiding in the bushes. Farley is sort of a poster child for arrested development, whereas his dad (Kevin McGee) is a bit of a hardass, and has been since his wife died. Farley's dad is always getting on his case, as fathers are wont to do, but the elder Wilder essentially verbally and psychologically abuses his kid for years and years, pushing Farley closer and closer to the brink of madness.\nMeanwhile, the young man is beset by two different young women: Katy, a younger girl next door (literally) who's more annoying than interesting to Farley, and Scarlett (Sharon Scalzo), an independent muse who's working on a book. No longer a complete loner, Farley begins keeping company with Scarlett, much to the chagrin of his father.\nAs with Monsters, Marriage and Murder in Manchvegas, the acting, script, direction, and photography are all pretty mediocre, but there are some bright spots. Okay, not many, but overall the acting was definitely better. In fact, leading man Farley is better here than in the later film, perhaps because he's playing a psychotic Peeping Tom. But even better is Scalzo as the trippy Scarlett; unlike most others in the cast, she seems to believe in the silly dialog she's given to speak. (Hey, selling the script is half of what acting is all about.) The thing is, it feels like there's much more effort made here than in the more-recent film. After all, even if you're given crap to work with, you can put a happy face on it and do your best. Sometimes a bounty of enthusiasm can make up for certain, shall we say, deficiencies.\nYou got to give props to a movie in which a character says something like \"We're sending him along to keep an eye on you\" while pointing to his own eye. That, my friends, is serious thespianism right there.\nYou also have to love a movie that lifts sound effects from the computer game Doom. At least it sounds a heck of a lot like it, and I've played a lot, lot, lot, lot of Doom in my time. (No more. Cold turkey. On the wagon now.) Still and all, considering the low, low budget and inexperienced cast and crew, this isn't nearly as horrible as it could have been. It helps a bit if you watch it ironically, as if the goings-on were a big joke to which only you were privy."}

Shot using stop animation, this one-of-a-kind movie has the elegance of both The Nightmare before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach with the quirkiness you'd expect from an Anderson film. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, and Bill Murray lend distinctive voices to a witty, delicious script.\nMr. Fox (Clooney) is an unrepentant thief until he makes a promise to Mrs. Fox (Streep) that he'll quit for good (after he informs him that she's pregnant) if they escape a farmer's trap. They do, and he makes good on the promise, moving the family from their underground home to an isolated tree near three vicious, desperate super farmers. But it's not long before Mr. Fox is pining to pull off One More Job, which turns into several more jobs, with the help of Kylie the opossum.\nHowever, the three farmers aren't your typical placid farmfolk, they're vengeful jerks, so after Mr. Fox makes off with much of their birds and cider, they vow revenge, which includes using a backhoe to remove not only the tree but also a huge chunk of the earth.\nThere's also an interesting subplot involving Mr. Fox's son Ash (Schwartzman), who feels that his parents think he's worthless and that he can't possibly compete with the super-debonair Mr. Fox. Ash is at that awkward age anyway, so dealing with his famed dad isn't easy. Then, on top of that, Ash's cousin Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson) arrives for an extended stay, and he's perfect in virtually everything. So poor Ash can't measure up to his dad OR his cousin.\nWhat makes this movie really work, though, is the magnificent animation style. We've all seen those old Rankin-Fitch Christmas classics, right? This is sort of like that, only even more stylized and fluid. The film was shot at a rate of 12 frames per second, rather than the standard 24, so that viewers could really see the actual stop-motion animation process itself. And the result is that the movie feels more organic, more natural, and more poetic.\nA Wes Anderson movie is usually oddly endearing anyway, but this one is exceptional in its uniquity. The set pieces are dazzling (for example, the hair on the humans is from actual human hair, from the movie's crew), and the backgrounds are meticulous works of art. Neat trivia: Mr. Fox's study is a faithful recreation of Roald Dahl's garden hut, where he wrote most of his beloved books.\nIt's fun seeing Clooney in a role he's best suited to anyway, the devilish rogue. (One gets the feeling sometimes that he'd really like to be James Bond.) Mr. Fox is certainly not without his flaws (need for spotlight, need to be right, delusions of grandeur), but his heart belongs to his family and to the other woodland creatures. The characters are nuanced just enough for kids to grasp their intentions and attitudes while not being too simplistic for adults to enjoy."}

There are too many characters to keep track of, and the action seems to be intentionally frantic, the better to distract you from the fact that little of the story makes a whit of sense.\nWe get to see the actual origins of Wolverine (that is, as a young child) when he discovers that the man he just killed with his bare, uh, claws was his real dad and that the guy he thought was just a good pal is actually his brother Victor, aka Sabretooth (Liev Schreiber). Later we see Wolverine (known then as Logan) and Sabretooth fighting in four different American wars (Civil, WWI, WWII, and Vietnam), and then he and his brother are eventually brought in as part of a mutant team called Weapon X by a sinister military guy, Colonel Stryker (Danny Huston). The mutants proceed to kick everyone's ass until Wolverine has a bout with decency and quits.\nFast forward six years later and Wolverine's living a placid life as a lumberjack in Canada with his hot girlfriend, Kayla Silverfox, and Stryker finds him and tells him someone's picking off the old team members (oh no!). Can Wolverine help? Who's responsible for these deaths? I bet Stryker knows more than he's telling. He's sinister, you know.\nIf I had to sum up this movie's plot in one word, it'd be \"revenge.\" Wolverine is constantly avenging someone or something. Sometimes he's just mad in general, but usually he's going after Sabretooth for something or going after Stryker for something or going after unnamed goons in helicopters and tanks for something. Another recurring motif is Wolverine's angst. The guy's like 140 years old, but he has the angst of a cuckolded teenager on prom night. At least twice he looks up to the heavens, arms spread, crying \"NOOOOOOOOOOO!\" Yes, in this day and age of highfalutin gizmodery we still have mopey superheroes.\nThe movie tries so damn hard to be loved that it forgets it's supposed to be sort of a superhero comic-book movie. There's endless backstory about the two brothers, and it feels like it's shoehorned in, almost as if the makers thought they had to explain themselves. Is it important to know that Wolverine's dad was a gardener? Probably not. Did he have to visit so many of the former members of Weapon X? I'm gonna say no.\nEven so, the final villain \u2013 Deadpool, who has all the strengths of the other mutants on the team and none of their weaknesses \u2013 is pretty damn scary and convincing. Trouble is, they make him so tough to kill that it's difficult to get closure on him. If you know what I mean. I mean, he has all of the strengths of these superhuman dudes without having those namby-pamby weaknesses! What's the point? At least the setting's appropriate for this movie: Three Mile Island, which for you youngsters out there we should note was the scene of a major nuclear-power-plant accident in 1979, which might be when this movie's denouement is set.\nAnyway, because there's so much exposition, there's little room for character \u2013 either character development or an actual character OF the film. It's bland, the porridge of comic-book movies. There's no cleverness, no wit, nothing more than snide asides and bon mots, as if we were in a faceless Stallone movie circa 1984. Jackman's game, of course, but he's now played Wolverine in four movies, so this wasn't exactly a stretch for him. I'd like to think that this clunker will put to rest any plans for future Origins installments, but I got a feeling we'll be seeing Magneto and Storm get their tales told someday as well."}

In particular, Jesse Eisenberg (Zombieland) is wonderful as the nebbish James, making up for the usual pouty-faced, lip-biting acting by Kristen Stewart. A cavalcade of quirky characters makes this all seem true to life, lending a sort of easygoing charm and appeal.\nJames is set to go to an Ivy League school, but his dad's transfer (and subsequent alcoholism) means the family can't afford the tuition. Eventually, James happens upon Adventureland, which is every bit as ritzy as its name implies, and is quickly put to work manning one of the games on the park's midway. It's here that he meets the alluring Em (Stewart), along with Joel (Martin Starr) and owners Bobby (Bill Hader) and Paulette (Kristen Wiig). Also entering the picture is the mysterious handyman Mike Connell (Ryan Reynolds), who's said to have jammed with Lou Reed, and the sexotic \u2013 new word! \u2013 Lisa P (Margarita Levieva).\nJames' problem? Many, as it turns out. He's a virgin (I know!), and Em is almost an unattainable ideal for him \u2013 she's cute (no, she's not), she's smart, she's worldly, and so on. Plus he's trying desperately to save up enough money to head to New York and start a life there. It helps, though, that he's the major weed supplier for the park's employees. Neat trick.\nEssentially, what you're left with is a slice of life, a look at a summer spent working in a hellhole (albeit with a cool boss like Bill Hader), accompanied by the usual teen/young adult angst and overactive hormones. I liked Jesse Eisenberg, and I think that his casting is essential to the movie's appeal. Didn't care for Stewart at all, and I wonder how she possibly gets these cute-indie-chick roles when she's neither cute nor indie. Where's this generation's Parker Posey or Janeane Garofalo? Ryan Reynolds was also appropriately douchey. It's sort of his character, his mien, his idiom, if you will."}

You almost feel a bit guilty when you pick on them, too, because you know the director probably hocked his entire Star Wars action figures collection to finance his labor of love.\nEven so, the odds are against the low-budget movie. In order for it to be successful, it has to be really, really good, because it's sure not going to get a huge advertising blitz \u2013 word of mouth will likely make or break it. The good news is that twenty years or so down the road, even the worst (especially the worst) will reemerge as cult classics. Hey, if it worked for Rocky Horror, it can work for anything.\nI don't think that sort of fate awaits Monsters, Marriage and Murder in Manchvegas, from the makers of Freaky Farley. This direct-to-video comedy is set in Manchester, NH; well, it's actually Manchvegas, a fictional stand-in for Manchester, but you get the drift. Anyway, the story focuses on a prank-loving group in town called the MOS (Manchvegas Outlaw Society), led by Marshall (director-writer-star Matt Farley). Marshall, who appears to be in his twenties, is in arrested development and only wants to have fun; meanwhile, his female coconspirator, Jenny (Marie Dellicker) is beginning to wish for a more adult relationship, which leads her to date older guys while still pining for Marshall. Secretly.\nMeanwhile, young women are being kidnapped off the streets and then murdered. Who's behind these diabolical crimes? Who knows? Who's up to solving the mystery? Why, MOS, of course! On the plus side, the movie is enthusiastic and silly; its high-energy attitude (despite the macabre plot) help disguise the fact that this is a poorly acted, poorly written, and poorly directed film. Okay, maybe that's more like damning with faint, faint praise. The acting is uniformly \u2013 and hysterically \u2013 grade-school bad. People recite their lines as if they learned them two minutes prior and couldn't be bothered to add such luxuries as tone and emphasis. The plot itself is nonsensical, sort of what you'd expect a hyperactive kindergartener to come up with after three hours of recess.\nAnd I know that's mean, and after all this is not a theatrical release anyway (it went straight to video), so what did I expect? I didn't expect much at all, frankly, and that's really what I got. The movie looks as if it were produced by a first timer, but this is the fourth entry for Matt Farley. I admire his perseverance, especially since he can't be making any money off these enterprises, but if your fourth movie is still really, really awful, maybe it's time to find another line of work."}

To enjoy this movie, you should not only suspend your disbelief but kick it out of school forever. On the plus side, it does offer plenty of gratuitous shots of a scantily clad young woman.\nCasey Beldon (Odette Yustman) is a smart, grounded lass who begins to have nightmares about a dog with its head screwed on upside down and a little evil child. Then, while babysitting, Casey is smacked in the head with a mirror by her young charge. Then one of her pupils begins to change color! Then customer-service reps answer her on the first ring and give her refunds! Mass hysteria! Turns out it's all connected to a seemingly crazy old lady at the local geriatric home, played by Jane Alexander. (The lady, not the home.) And the Holocaust and Joseph Mengele. And now there's some demon coming after Casey, determined to make her pay for sins past! As the movie progresses, the plot gets dumber and dumber; inconsistencies are explained away with only a curt nod to logic. People act one way and then turn around and say Whoops, my bad, I lied to you because I was scared. Plus, virtually no one believes Casey when bad things begin to happen to her, because they'd rather be mean jerks than at least humor her. I'm talking about her best friend (Meagan Good) and her boyfriend (Cam Gigandet)! People like that treat Casey badly - that is, until they find out she's not bonkers. Nice friends.\nAbout the only good part of this movie comes near the very end. No spoilers here, but it involves an exorcism. That scene is intense, well crafted, and damn scary. Too bad it makes little sense. Look, Casey is haunted by some evil entity out for revenge, but she's not possessed by said demon - it merely manifests itself in other forms, like bugs, a dog, other people, and so on. Haunting is not the same as possession! Everyone knows that."}

It\u2019s hardly entertaining to watch pretentious, better-than-you Brits fall madly in love despite treachery and criminal intent. In the end, you don\u2019t really feel sympathy toward any of the characters, which makes the whole enterprise a meaningless distraction.\nYoung Jenny (Carey Mulligan) aspires to go to Oxford and study English, under much pressure from her dad (Alfred Molina). Suddenly, into her life comes a much-older man, David (Peter Sarsgaard), who\u2019s worldly and rich and just plain wonderful in every possible way. Soon he\u2019s swept Jenny off her feet, thus replacing her ambitions with visions of living in Paris and having fun. At first her family will have none of it, but David smooth talks them into going along.\nI\u2019m not sure exactly when the movie started to lose its luster for me, but it didn\u2019t take very long. The trouble is that neither Jenny nor David is particularly likable, when you get right down to it. Take Jenny, our protagonist. She\u2019s super smart \u2013 getting high marks in everything but Latin \u2013 and full of poise and maturity, but she\u2019s a complete and utter moron when it comes to David. Making bad decisions won\u2019t gain my sympathy unless those decisions seemed logical for the character at the time. For instance, we can see how Jenny would make the decisions she made if she were in love (which she was) and kind of dumb and naive (which she was not). The fact that she was presented as an intelligent, mature-for-her-age classical cellist (albeit one in high school) should have precluded her bad decision making to some degree. I won\u2019t dare give away what decisions she makes, but there are a few of them, and they seem ludicrous.\nDavid\u2019s pals, Danny and Helen, are also rich knuckleheads to whom there\u2019s more than meets the eye. But once you see what\u2019s beneath their sneering veneer (not really, that just sounded nice), you realize the characters are too shallow for you to care about, in any event. Helen\u2019s character in particular is meant to be sort of a foil to Jenny\u2019s (i.e., she\u2019s secretly jealous of the ing\u00e9nue), but this simple premise is barely hinted at, let alone followed up on. And get this \u2013 Helen is supposed to be the comic relief of the crew (she\u2019s dumb), but her jokes are entirely unfunny and inconsequential.\nFew things are as dull as seeing well-off people whine about their lives, or play smug cads. Instead of really drawing me into the world of Jenny and her family and friends, I was completely put off by the vapid, predictable story. Mulligan (who looks a lot like Katie Holmes) is not bad at all, although her scenes with Sarsgaard (she\u2019s 22 in real life, but she\u2019s playing a 16 year old here) come off pretty creepy. Alfred Molina easily steals every scene he\u2019s in."}

Nicolas Cage stars as the titular cop who doesn\u2019t so much as bend the law as stomp it flat in his quest to do whatever. Cage isn\u2019t terrible, but even his unhinged charisma isn\u2019t quite edgy enough and feels one dimensional. Even the nihilism of Harvey Keitel\u2019s character in the earlier film had more of a point than this uneven drama.\nTerence McDonagh is a detective in New Orleans. We pick up his story shortly after the landfall of Hurricane Katrina; in an early scene, he and his partner (Val Kilmer) joke about saving or not saving a prisoner in a cell in which the water level has risen past the man\u2019s head. As the criminal desperately treads water, McDonagh takes odds on his survival before the firemen come to rescue him.\nAs before, our protagonist is investigating a crime. A family of five has been shot, execution style, in their home. McDonagh must, of course, pull out all the stops to solve the crime and thus get more power and money and keep his prostitute girlfriend (Eva Mendes) in nice clothes and a high-class hotel. He also has a serious drug habit, shaking down clubgoers in exchange for not busting them for whatever it is they didn\u2019t do. McDonagh also has to deal with his father, a recovering alkie, and his father\u2019s girlfriend (Jennifer Coolidge) a current alkie, who live out in the middle of the bayou.\nBut where Ferrara\u2019s movie pushed the envelope and strained our sense of good taste, Werner Herzog\u2019s alleged remake seems too straightforward. McDonagh is just another dirty cop who breaks the rules to get what he wants. In the 17 years between films, we\u2019ve all seen countless movies about dirty cops, and Cage\u2019s McDonagh seems no better or worse than any of them. Keitel\u2019s unnamed lieutenant desecrated churches and pranced about in a naked, drunken stupor, but Cage\u2019s cop can\u2019t summon up the cojones to do anything that wild and crazy. Or maybe it\u2019s just that we\u2019re all so numb to outlandish on screen behavior that there\u2019s not much that Cage and Herzog could have done to shock and awe us.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Ferrara, when asked about Herzog\u2019s upcoming film, didn\u2019t have much nice to say about it; Herzog also stated in interviews that he didn\u2019t feel that his movie was a remake of Ferrara\u2019s, despite the title, because he (Herzog) had not seen the original. (Well, you can\u2019t fault that logic, right?) I just didn\u2019t find anything horrible about this movie, nothing that makes me really dislike it. But I also didn\u2019t find it wildly entertaining. It has its adrenaline moments, and the cast tries, but it\u2019s just an ineffective film. It\u2019s fun to see Val Kilmer, though, and Mendes looks great.\nThe trouble with this movie is that the connection to the original is tenuous at best; it sort of feels like the Bad Lieutenant part was tacked on in an effort to sell more tickets. Nah, that\u2019s unpossible. Hollywood would never use familiarity to make more money, right? Cage is going to have to do far more of these to pay off his tax bill."}

So much of the plot depends on things that happened in previous films; in fact, even if you\u2019ve obsessively followed the series, you\u2019re going to have to work hard to keep up. Having said that, though, Saw VI is a disgusting treat that\u2019s fairly tightly plotted but isn\u2019t overly complicated. It\u2019s not as great as the first couple in the series, but it does manage to continue the mayhem of the fifth movie while concurrently showing a couple of new \u201cgames.\u201d By the end of the fifth film, Jigsaw is dead. But that doesn\u2019t stop him from making further appearances; the writers simply tell stories in a more nonlinear fashion, as some of the events take place before the events of the original Saw. In any case, someone new \u2013 Agent Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) is helping Jigsaw with his morality plays, but the cops are now looking into the murder of Seth Baxter, and they\u2019ve figured out that the murder wasn\u2019t perpetrated by Jigsaw himself. Seems only a matter of time before they figure out who the accomplice is.\nMeanwhile, an insurance-company executive has his own series of tests. As with most of the previous tests, William Easton must make some painful decisions about who lives and who dies, much as he does on a daily basis when he rejects medical claims for so-called preexisting conditions. Easton has explosives on each of his four limbs, and once he completes a test he will be able to unlock one device. Trouble is, each of the tests involves other people \u2013 his underlings, a reporter, a lawyer \u2013 who have connections to his line of work.\nSo there\u2019s a lot going on, with the investigation and Easton\u2019s predicament basically running concurrently. Everything seems to interlock into everything else \u2013 including many events and situations from earlier movies \u2013 rather seamlessly. This means that we get clarifying details that color in John Kramer\u2019s intentions and motivations, not to mention further clues as to how the accomplices are connected to each other \u2013 and how much each knows.\nAs with the rest of the movies in the series, the underlying theme is one of morality and the choices that are made in life. Easton rejects claimants based on their ability to pay, which marks him as an immoral predator on the sick, in Jigsaw\u2019s eyes. Now that he has to make these decisions in the heat of the moment, without using his probability formulas, while making physical sacrifices of his own, what will he choose? The moral of this story, as always, is that those who make callous decisions that destroy lives must be held accountable, must learn their lessons somehow.\nIn case you\u2019re still not sure if this is your cup of tea, let me be clear: this is not for the faint of heart. There\u2019s plenty of blood, there\u2019s bones breaking, there\u2019s eviscerations, there\u2019s trepanation. It\u2019s not a feel-good film. Even so, Saw VI is a lot of fun: its success is in moving forward simultaneous new plots and coloring in segments of previous plots while still offering up more than the recommended daily allowance of gore and terror.

Imaginative in design and efficient in execution, the film takes what was a sparsely written book and delivers a detailed, creative, and delightful story that\u2019s suitable for both kids and adults.\nA young boy named Max (Max Record) is full of anger; he feels misunderstood and unloved, even though it\u2019s not apparent to the rest of us that he\u2019s being neglected or abused. Max just hates because he hates, and when he\u2019s confused or insecure, he rages against everything. After bitterly acting out against his mom (Catherine Keener), Max runs away from home (in a slight departure from the book), finds a boat, and sails a wide, endless sea to an isolated island full of strange, odd-looking creatures.\nThe Wild Things are essentially exact replicas of those found in Maurice Sendak\u2019s 1963 book. Actors inhabited large costumes, and the facial movements were added with CGI; the result is that each Wild Thing is individualized, with a strong personality.\nOn the island, Max finds the Wild Things in the middle of destroying their own huts. Well, specifically, one Wild Thing, Carol (James Gandolfini), is wrecking the huts, throwing everyone else into a bit of a tizzy. Max, clad in a wolf costume, restores order by telling the creatures that he is a king from a far-away land; the Wild Things respond by making Max their own king.\nThe turmoil affecting the monster tribe is complicated, and Max\u2019s arrival merely forestalls additional confrontations. Carol believes that Max is a true king, but even that belief doesn\u2019t alleviate the tension in the group. There are six Wild Things: Carol, Judith (Catherine O\u2019Hara), Ira (Forest Whitaker), Douglas (Chris Cooper), Alexander (Paul Dano), and KW (Lauren Ambrose), each with his or her own personality.\nIt\u2019s not clear whether the island and its denizens are meant to be real or merely figments of Max\u2019s effervescent imagination, but it\u2019s plain that the Wild Things represent many facets of Max\u2019s personality and others in his life. Carol is a leader and wants to be beloved, but he misses his true love \u2013 KW \u2013 with whom he\u2019s had a spat and who has temporarily left the group. Carol is analogous to Max himself, and KW is Max\u2019s mom. Alexander is usually ignored by the others in the group, just as Max believes he is treated by his peers. Ira and Judith, who love each other, are twin sides of the same coin: Max\u2019s mother. Ira is kind and loving, even deferential to Judith, who is openly antagonistic and negative and not a little bossy. This is how Max views his mom, one reasons; she is a woman who both loves him and controls him, a woman who is equal parts yin and yang. This is not, however, how we the audience see her, because instead we see a woman frustrated on multiple levels.\nPop psychology aside, though, the set pieces are tremendous. From the sweeping vistas of the paradisal island, including a vast desert, a thick forest, and golden beaches, to the one big project that Max and the Wild Things complete \u2013 a huge living quarters with miles of tunnels leading all over the island. Jonze really went the extra mile to replicate the beautiful illustrations in Sendak\u2019s masterful book.\nWhere the Wild Things Are is dark and deep, but it also makes your heart ache and soar. Jonze has managed to capture the essence of a beloved book \u2013 no easy feat \u2013 while producing a wholly entertaining film. Some scenes may be a little intense for very young viewers, but the rousing majesty of such unbridled imagination \u2013 both Max\u2019s and Spike\u2019s \u2013 lead to a satisfying conclusion."}

Gary Gray's Law Abiding Citizen, about a man using violence to bring down the legal system while behind bars, falls under the weight of its own premise. Butler and Foxx are good, but movie pretends there's a cat-and-mouse game afoot; Foxx's DA has little to do but run from explosion to explosion, and by the end logic and continuity have been cheerfully tossed out the window.\nClyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) is an average guy who's victimized by a home invasion, during which his wife and daughter are murdered while he watches, tied up. The bad guys are rounded up, and district attorney Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) gets one of them to sell out the other, thus making a deal that allows the first to get off scot free. As you might imagine, this doesn't sit too well with Mr. Shelton, who is not happy that the deal was made without his knowledge or input.\nFlash forward ten years later, and the convicted felon is about to be executed, and it turns out to not be a particularly pleasant execution - things go wrong, the bad guy suffers a painful death, and so on. Rice eventually puts two and two together and figures out that Shelton's behind it - but it seems that there's more to the situation than meets the eye, as Shelton has an entirely different agenda in mind. And thus begins the nominal cat-and-mouse game, as Shelton continues to wreak havoc while in solitary confinement in Philadelphia's maximum-security prison.\nFor me, the movie fails on several levels. Although it does have plenty of well-staged action scenes, the logic needed to sustain what's really a psychological thriller is absent in large quantities, as the so-called good guys' actions often don't make much sense other than to propel the plot a bit more.\nFirst and foremost is the motivation. Shelton is mad because Rice took the deal that let one of the guys who murdered his (Shelton's) family go free. Shelton then decides to \"show\" everyone involved that their system of justice isn't optimal for anyone other than the bad guys; to illustrate this point, he decides to bump off those who had anything to do with the plea bargain. Which makes sense to a point, but Shelton then extends that logic to include anyone involved with those involved with the plea bargain, and even those who happen to be idly walking by (figuratively speaking).\nSo at first, we're meant to think that Shelton's a victim here (he is), and we really should root for him. We're in his corner. Rice is an egotistical jerkwad who barely notices his family and doesn't prosecute unless he's assured of a victory, so he's easily seen as a bad guy. But over the course of the film, sympathy for Shelton and his situation completely disappears. Which would have been fine if Rice had been shown as an equal match for Shelton's wits - he was instead led around by his nose, constantly several steps behind the villain.\nAnd therein lies a crucial problem with the movie: it's predictable. Yes, there are some scenes that will make you jump, but Gray takes so long in setting them up that you sort of expect them to happen. There's also the problem of showing the best action scenes in the previews and trailers, so you know those are upcoming as well.\nThis is a standard revenge action film with a twist (i.e., that the antagonist is behind bars while most of the mayhem is occurring) that doesn't even make sense at the end of the movie. Let me put it this way, to avoid spoilers. Throughout the movie, you're wondering how Shelton is able to accomplish his violent deeds while in solitary confinement - really, the only thing the movie has going for it - but when you find out his secret, it's so mundane and eminently avoidable that you wonder what all the fuss was about. In fact, the ending itself is senseless, as a better alternative certainly was available.\nYou also wonder if Shelton's point about the injustice of the justice system was even really made; Shelton's slaughter of the innocents doesn't prove that the system is injust, it just proves he's a sadistic murderer.\nI was fortunate enough to witness a question-and-answer session with director Gray after the movie. I took the following from the session: 1. F. Gary Gray likes doing different types of movies, because he wants to avoid being typecast. And yet this movie wasn't cinematically much different than, say The Negotiator or even Set It Off. So I'm not sure this was an accurate point.\n2. F. Gary Gray doesn't think this movie is anything like The Dark Knight. An audience member drew the parallel, but the director seemed to think that his movie was much better than the Batman movie, and he downplayed any thematic similarities. Here's why they're similar. Each film has a psychotic bad guy who spends much of the film trying to get under the protagonist's skin - and usually succeeds while in custody of law enforcement. Both films are dark, psychological thrillers. Both films have antagonists who have more vibrant personalities than their respective foils. The films differ in that the performance of one actor (Heath Ledger) was monumentally better than that of the corresponding bad guy (Butler).\nLaw Abiding Citizen, hyphen or no hyphen, is an overblown, illogical mess that can be a lot of fun to watch if one checks one's brain at the door and isn't concerned with such notions as cohesion and reason. Things go explody. The end."}

But it's a true mindbender, and it's packed with action that moves so quickly neither the actors nor the audience can really catch a breath, which is a good move if your plot is shaky to begin with.\nAs with the best deep-space movies, the context is mental illness, what the Professor on Gilligan's Island called, oddly enough, \"island madness.\" Only in space. In the distant, distant future, a ship has been sent from the Earth carrying a lot of people, headed to the only Earth-like planet ever found. Sometime during the journey, things go awry. We pick up the story as an astronaut named Bower (Ben Foster) awakens from hypersleep, abruptly; he's soon followed by his commanding officer, Payton (Dennis Quaid). The rest of the crew is gone, and the only door is locked from the outside. What's happened here? Making matters more difficult is the amnesia that each man suffers from, owing to their having been in hypersleep way longer than intended. Somehow, they must piece together what has happened and find out what lies behind that door - and throughout the rest of the gigantic ship.\nNot only does the movie recall Aliens and 2001, you can also see similarities to The Descent and The Abyss; really, any movie in which people are trapped in claustrophobic environs. And although the pacing is frenetic at times, the movie is really chillingly shot (by Wedigo von Schultzendorff). On the one hand, the plot flows linearly - Bower needs to get to the ship's reactor so he can reboot it and save everyone - meaning that the actors race from scene to scene, running out of time. On the other hand, they don't piece together what's happened as quickly as they might in other, lesser films; they seem to figure things out gradually, as if assembling a puzzle in their heads. Bowers and others - and there are others - discover right away, though, that they're not really alone on the ship and that their enemies are extremely strong and fast and vicious.\nInjected into this oh-my-goodness-what's-out-there madness is, well, madness. The movie's title is explained as being a sort of mental illness that affects astronauts from time to time, when they just plain go bonkers for seemingly no reason and kill everyone on board. Is that's what's happening here? Is Bower the crazy one? Or is it Payton? Are they, in fact, alone on the ship? Foster is excellent as the hero who remembers a little bit more of their mission as time elapses; Quaid, in turn, shows a few more layers than we're accustomed to seeing from him (he's usually more of a poor man's Harrison Ford). Both actors turn in convincing, full-throated performances that complement, rather than succumb to, the special effects and cinematic wizardry. Often, the effects are the entire show. Now, it's true that you won't see a lot of character development here, as you might in the most cerebral of sci-fi, but what works best here is the paucity of knowledge about the situation and the characters. By spinning the tale gradually, feeding the audience only a snippet at a time, director Christian Alvart dangles the mystery in front of his viewers without allowing them to settle back and solve the mystery on their own. When you're constantly kept on your toes with sudden lurches of unseen shapes and reverberating noises, you - like the befuddled characters - are concurrently kept off balance. The result is an unsettling, entertaining delight."}

It\u2019s gory and disgusting, but most of all, it\u2019s terrific fun, with just the right mix of violence and off-kilter comedy.\nJesse Eisenberg plays a young man named Columbus (because that\u2019s where he\u2019s heading, across the wasteland that is the middle US). Columbus is scared of just about everything: clowns, the cloths people use to wipe down tables, bathrooms, you name it. A hot apartment neighbor comes down with this hot new disease that all the cool kids don\u2019t want to have, and before you know it he\u2019s killed her (well, rekilled) and is on the run, fleeing zombies and making up a long list of rules of how to survive in the eponymous new land. Near the beginning of our story, he meets up with a man he calls Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), who\u2019s, uh, on his way to Tallahassee, and they in turn meet with a couple of con girls (Abagail Breslin and Emma Stone).\nComparisons to Shaun of the Dead are somewhat apt, as both movies are comedic takes on a horror subgenre, and director Ruben Fleischer was influenced by the Simon Pegg-Nick Frost movie. But. Zombieland is both funnier and more sincere; it\u2019s not a slapstick comedy, and it\u2019s not really a horror film, as Shaun of the Dead was. In fact, it\u2019s sort of quirky and genreless.\nThere were a LOT of laugh-out-loud moments for me in this movie, and I think a chief reason it all gels is that the leads are so perfectly cast. Eisenberg is awesome as the protagonist, the vulnerable hero, and Harrelson is a real hoot as the Mad-Max-like (or maybe Ash from Evil Dead) gentle psycho who desires nothing more than to waste zombies and find one, just one, Twinkie. Yes, I said Twinkie! I also really liked Abagail Breslin as the moppet Little Rock. It\u2019s always tough for child actors to make the transition into more-adult roles, but she\u2019s up to the task here. Emma Stone is tough and sweet as her sisterly counterpart.\nThere\u2019s a cameo that\u2019ll surely surprise you \u2013 and what\u2019s more, it really works. The actor \u2013 no spoilers here! \u2013 really sells the role. Let\u2019s just say that he plays himself. Did I mention that the main characters are headed to California and that basically everyone else in the world is either dead or a zombie? Everyone? You don\u2019t often hear people applaud during a movie, but applaud we did at a couple key moments. The final scene in an amusement park is witty and lighthearted, at least as lighthearted as mowing down zombies with machine guns can be.\nNow, granted, there\u2019s plenty of blood splattering, plenty of gore, plenty of cursing, and even some nudity. And yes, it\u2019s even gratuitous. But not for a zombie movie. For a zombie movie, those things are sort of underplayed a little bit, at least in the true horror sense \u2013 they\u2019re played much more for chuckles than anything else. If anything, Zombieland is a movie that dares you to take it seriously, just so it can pull the rug out from under you and we can all laugh. It\u2019s an offbeat look at an overused genre that cranks out the guts and guffaws in equal, lethal doses."}

Or maybe he's not as innocent as he looks and is simply trying to take over the embattled company. Or maybe he's just mentally unstable. But the result is lamebrained and uninvolving; as the movie progresses, it's clear there's more to things than meets the eye but little reason to care. With a protagonist who isn't convincing as either a victim or a perpetrator, The Informant! ultimately tries way too hard to please. Damon's characterizations are difficult to pin down, making it impossible to root for him or against him at any point, even at the very end.\nThe Informant! is an absurdist piece, but it just doesn't work. You get the feeling that if this had been a straightforward industrial-wrongdoing bit, it could have been a strong, acerbic eyebrow raiser about Big Bad Companies. It could have been The Insider, an investigative movie that was just as much about the behind-the-scenes machinations of the good guys and the bad guys as it was about the evils of the smoking industry. But you get little of that in The Informant!, which apparently sees itself as a comedy of errors. As the lies of Mark Whitacre (Damon) - to the FBI, to his bosses, to his lawyers - pile up, all semblance of reality and logic go flying out the window.\nDamon plays Whitacre with almost unhinged glee, but it's as if he's in on the joke, and you're not. At times, he reminds you of Andy from The 40 Year Old Virgin, so innocent in the ways of the world, and the next thing you know he's lying his butt off to anyone who will listen. Is it all part of an elaborate scheme, or is he just a chronic liar? It might not be evident even by the end of the movie, which sort of puts the protagonist's role in a bit of stasis.\nFor me, there are people for whom you root, people against whom you root, and people whose intentions are nebulous. I don't even mind it when there are unexplained actions by the characters; it's okay if there are loose plot threads. So it's not that I don't agree with Mark Whitacre being this playing-all-sides sort of fellow, it's just that all of the actions he undertakes, whether he's working with the feds, interacting with his smarter wife, or narrating himself, are a colossal bore. That's the crux of it right there - the movie is boring; the plot is so straightforward and vanilla that the audience isn't likely to be emotionally invested in Whitacre or his family (we hardly ever see the kids anyway) and therefore isn't likely to give a hoot what happens to them."}

Led by Harrison Ford, the ensemble cast touches all the bases. Although the movie can be very difficult to watch at times, owing to its subject matter, it's a tough-minded look at the often-tragic issue of immigration.\nFord plays Max Brogan, an INS agent stationed in Los Angeles, who decides to help an illegal textile worker (Alice Braga) by making sure that the woman's son is taken to his grandmother (the woman's mother) in Mexico when the woman is detained. Meanwhile, Max's partner Hamid Baraheri (Cliff Curtis), struggles to reconcile his job with the culture of his family (Iranian) and the reckless behavior of his younger sister. Ray Liotta plays Cole Frankel, an adjudicator who determines the status of immigrants and their green cards; Alice Eve is an aspiring Australian actress who has to degrade herself to lengthen her stay in the country; Ashley Judd plays Liotta's wife, who defends immigrants in status cases. In a parallel storyline, a young Korean youth, days before his family's naturalization ceremony, makes a decision that could have terrible consequences.\nAll of these story lines are intricately intertwined, but here's where the movie differs from Crash: the interactions of the various characters never feel forced or insincere, and the characters themselves are not simple good people doing bad things or bad people doing good things.\nThe acting is uniformly grand. Ford, who rarely plays nonhero roles let alone supporting roles, is excellent as the crusty, world-weary agent, trying desperately to solve a serious crime that may hit close to home while also doing the right thing by the young textile-worker mother. Also shining is Judd (and, to a lesser extent, Liotta, although he plays the same character in many of his movies now - a slimeball), but really sealing the deal is Curtis (10,000 BC, Sunshine) as the conflicted agent of Iranian descent.\nLike the issue of immigration itself, the movie is complicated, almost detrimentally so, but the conflict should certainly resonate with its audience, even if one is not an immigrant or part of a family that has recently immigrated. Certain scenes are almost deadly with their pathos, figuratively rending your heart as they play out. Emotionally gripping scenes such as these (particularly near the end of the film) exemplify precisely the kind of psychological gymnastics that a director must undertake for a film like this to have any sort of positive effect on its audience. That is, the entire issue of immigration is fraught with anger, deceit, terror, and sadness, and it can be tricky to walk the line between one feeling or another, lest one be accused of bias.\nCrossing Over falls into none of the traps that Crash fell into. Its character-driven storyline is brimming with plausible conflict that eclipses the usual cops-and-illegals pastiche, choosing instead to deal with problems on a more individual level. The result is an honest, illuminating look at a sometimes-vexing subject, although it is clearly not for all tastes."}

I found his vision of John Carpenter's classic to be stylish without drifting from the core issues of the original. Sure, it's gorier, but you knew that going in. Zombie's followup isn't a direct sequel to the first Halloween II but rather to his own film, and personally I thought it (and the blood) flowed rather nicely. It's clear the man is passionate about his horror.\nYou know how I know a horror movie works for me? When the killer leaps out unexpectedly. Time was, that was basically every time, but we're a little more jaded now and really expect him continuously. You know what else works? When the characters are more than just victims, cardboard standups there for the killin'. When something happens to these people, you feel it. Example, Sheriff Brackett rushes back to his house, realizing that Michael Myers - not dead! - is probably in the middle of hacking his daughter to pieces. At that moment, we feel what Brackett feels - not just that an innocent, but the man's daughter is being killed. Done right, this kind of scene can pack an emotional wallop, something you don't often see in slasher movies.\nHere's the story. It's a year later, and Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) is trying to get on with her life after Michael Myers escaped from a mental institution, returned to Haddonfield, Illinois, and tried to kill her. Laurie bears the considerable mental and physical scars of her encounter with Michael, as does her friend Annie Brackett, and she now lives with Annie and her father, Sheriff Brackett (Brad Dourif). Michael's supposedly dead, but we wouldn't have a sequel if that were truly the case, so he finds his way back to Haddonfield as well, cutting a swath of bloody corpses (or leaving a path of bloody corpses).\nZombie's great talent is style. You see it in his old White Zombie videos, you see it in his animated sequence in Beavis and Butt-head Do America, and you see it in his earlier films. The man has verve and panache. People don't just get smacked around, they get pummeled, and not just men, either. People don't just get stabbed in the leg, they get sliced up. Dogs, too. It's not a movie for the weak of heart.\nWhat also works here is that Zombie never loses sight of the story. (Yes, there is one.) Sometimes, with crappier horror movies, the director will simply go all-in and make everything as goopily gory as possible. There's a plot here, and there are victims and good guys, too. There are other things in the movie, is what I'm saying, and Zombie makes sure we remember they're there, too. Keep the story moving - Michael must have some reason to butcher someone, even if that reason is \"they were in the way.\" One problem I had with the movie, though, was the character of Dr. Loomis. In the first-series films Loomis (played by Donald Pleasance) is a kindly doctor, terribly upset that he's inadvertently unleashed Michael onto the world by letting him escape. In this movie, Loomis (played by Malcolm McDowell) is a greedy, self-indulgent jerk who's pushing a tell-all memoir about the events of a year ago. Loomis seemed a lot more concerned with everyone's well being in Zombie's first film, but here he simply doesn't care about anyone - even going so far as to reveal a potentially deadly secret to sell books. I'm not sure if it was just McDowell hamming it up or an oversight on the writer (also Zombie), but the character seemed way over the top, sort of like Gale Whatshername from the Scream movies, which were parodying the way newsie types profit from misery and woe.\nBut overall, I liked this sequel quite a bit. I was literally the only person in the entire theater this morning, which is always quite nice. I particularly liked Brad Dourif as the strong but vulnerable police chief; a great performance from an underlooked character actor.\nNote: Zombie (and the studio) has said he won't be back for Halloween III, should it come to fruition."}

Dustin Hoffman is a jingle-music writer who falls for Emma Thompson, a data-gatherer for the British government, while in London for his daughter's wedding. They meet ugly, then cute, then one does something that makes the other thing the one doesn't like them, then they reconcile, the end.\nHoffman plays Harvey Shine, a man who's running out of chances in life. His boss (Richard Schiff) wants a younger guy to take over their firm's important account, but Harvey insists he'll be back after the wedding to handle the account. You can guess what happens; there are delays and other problems, and Harvey's canned before he's been in England more than a day. Meanwhile, turns out that everyone in the family dislikes Harvey for some reason; his daughter elects to have her stepfather give her away instead of Harvey, a decision that implies some neglect on Harvey's part toward his daughter. Oh, and for some reason, at the last minute, the entire family is moved from their hotel prior to the rehearsal dinner to a nice, old house - except Harvey, who isn't even told. You see what I mean? So Harvey's a put-upon schlub. Meanwhile, Kate Walker (Thompson) is a statistician, the kind of person who bothers you as you deplane, asking you how your flight was. Harvey brushes her off at first - as we all do - but then runs into her later at the hotel bar as they commiserate over their lack of good fortune. Then they walk and talk and walk and talk and talk and talk and oh my goodness get to something. She talks Harvey into attending the wedding reception (he was going to head back to New York for his job, but oh well), and naturally that lets them both cut loose a little bit.\nApparently this project came to be after Hoffman and Thompson worked together on 2006's Stranger than Fiction. The idea of two older people - and remember, Hoffman is a good twenty years older than Thompson - falling for each other, even that quickly, is a sweet one, and the two leads are certainly capable of such delicate emotions. But the pacing is awful, something that can be largely blamed on the director (Joel Hopkins). The first thirty minutes or so before Harvey and Kate meet are just cringe worthy - you feel bad for Hoffman, but you're not entirely sure why. Maybe he deserves the bad treatment he gets, you don't know. Maybe he's kind of a jerk. And his maladies and issues are so drawn out before Thompson shows up that you keep checking your watch to see if you can travel back in time, or something.\nThat said, the two leads click rather well, but the leaden pacing of the film really does them in. By the time their chemistry really kicks in, the movie has settled into a rut of traditional romantic-comedy actions and reactions, and eventually you just plain stop caring what happens to either one of them. There's no explanation given for Harvey's maltreatment, nor is there a suitable explanation for how a movie with these two leads could miss its mark so badly."}

Audiences loved the lone wolf riding a hog, bad men who were sort of good inside because they took on badder men. Lots of guns, naked women, and violence. Larry Bishop's Hell Ride is a throwback to these drive-in flicks (he's a refugee from them, himself), and it's a wild, crusty, profane, and ultimately entertaining dirtball of a movie.\nThe only way to make a bad-ass biker look like a hero is to make his enemy even worse. In Hell Ride, Pistolero (Bishop) seeks revenge for the murder of Cherokee Kisum (Julia Jones) back in 1976. Cherokee had a son, Comanche (Eric Balfour), who may or may not still be alive, and the biker gang who killed his mom thirty years ago, the 666ers, is reforming and hoping to wreak more havoc.\nRiding with Pistolero and Comanche is The Gent (Michael Madsen), while the 666ers include The Deuce (David Carradine), Billy Wings (Vinnie Jones), and maybe Eddie Zero (Dennis Hopper). They sound like good, down-to-earth boys, don't they? Fellas you could raise a family or two with. Good, honest, law-abiding old dudes.\nWell, you know what you're gonna get with this cast. There's bloodshed, there's plenty of naked women and drug use, and even naked women using drugs. There's a guy who shoots his victims with a crossbow, always a hoot. There's doublecrossing, and there's the wide expanse of the vast California desert serving as a stark, realistic backdrop to all the shenanigans.\nObviously, you're not going to enjoy this much if you don't like violent movies to begin with. One of the producers is Quentin Tarantino, and some of his trademarks abound, such as a view from a box looking up, like the briefcase in Pulp Fiction. Tarantino, a film scholar of his generation if there ever was one, takes great pains to capture the spirit and look of those early-era biker movies. The opening scene is a homage to Hopper's own Easy Rider (1969), and the whole movie was done as sort of an update/nod to Bishop's own The Savage Seven (1968). Love him or hate him, you have to admit Tarantino loves to get the details right, and damned if this movie doesn't look great.\nYou couldn't ask for a better hardcore, leathery cast, either. Hopper steals every scene; his character could be seen as a cross between his Billy in Easy Rider and his unnamed photographer in Apocalypse Now. Carradine has only one scene, but it's as powerful as his Kill Bill appearances, which is saying a lot. Madsen gets more screen time than either of them, and he runs away with the entire picture from Bishop, who's probably better suited to supporting roles.\nRegardless, Hell Ride is a dusty-fingernail, rubber-burning thriller full of gut-shooting, incredibly gorgeous women, and peyote. Excellent for fans of the genre."}

(We both come from solid video-store-employee stock, you see.) I have enjoyed all of his films, including the ones he wrote but didn't direct. And I have to say that compared with his other works, Inglourious Basterds falls short of all of them.\nThe (fictional) story is about a group of Jewish Americans recruited by one Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) to hunt Nazi soldiers and, well, scalp them. Raine's Basterds are very good at their jobs (Raine's required 100 literal scalps from his crew), and their notoriety has spread. The team is assigned by the Americans to rendezvous with a German actress/double agent named Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger), who has discovered that the location of the premiere of Joseph Goebbels' latest propaganda film has been moved from the vast Ritz theater to a smaller venue in Nazi-occupied Paris.\nUnbeknownst to von Hammersmark and the Basterds, the young owner of the new venue, played by Melanie Laurent has her own plans for the premiere; she and her lover will set the theater on fire, killing all the high-ranking Nazis inside, including Goebbels and Hitler.\nThere are also two other smaller stories (all four dovetail in the end, of course). An SS officer, Colonel Landa (Christoph Waltz), known as \"the Jew Hunter,\" has a Jewish family murdered on a remote farm in France, where they are being hid. Naturally, the one person who escapes his wrath that day grows into the young theater owner. Also, a German sharpshooter, now a national hero, is the subject of Goebbels' new film and is himself trying to woo the young theater owner.\nMy first problem with the movie is the revenge factor itself. In order for me to root for a protagonist who's exacting revenge, I need to a) sympathize with their plight and b) believe that the punishment they're meting out is suitable. And although there's plenty of style to this film, I don't think that the Basterds met either of those criteria. In fact, it would be one thing if this were a straightforward (and straightfaced) revenge flick, like Death Wish, but Pitt and his fellow Basterds take far too much glee in torturing and dissecting Nazis than I'm comfortable with. Their mirth seems not only out of place, it seems kind of sick minded and unnecessary.\nMy second problem is just as insidious: the casting of Brad Pitt. I am a fan of Brad Pitt's work, as I am of Tarantino's. I think he can turn in good work when he wants to - that is, when he's not playing the sly, smarmy character he sometimes lapses into in movies like the Ocean's films. And that's what he does here. He's not just a superspy who's in charge of an elite commando unit, he's just a thuggish jerk who's really no better than the villains he's mowing down. On top of that, Pitt uses a ridiculous southern drawl that sounds exactly like someone trying to sound like a southern backwoods hillbilly mountain man: made-up, well over the top, and really grating to the ears. Killing natsies, indeed. I just think that a better actor, in this case, would have lent more gravitas to the role; Pitt's Raine feels like everything in the movie's supposed to be a big joke.\nOverall, I was surprised to find few real twists or any memorable dialog (other than the laughable lines that Pitt overplays, seen in the trailers and previews anyway). Tarantino is known for slick, clever dialog, especially quick patter, and none of that was evident here. The twist - such as it is - is amply evident to everyone except the characters themselves.\nAt 153 minutes, Inglourious Basterds is as long as most other Tarantino songs, but without crisp dialog and tightly staged action scenes, it drags on. In some scenes (a standoff in an underground bar is well shot), this works, but overall there's just far too much down time."}

Movies were produced cheaply and titillated their audiences with guns, half-naked women, and a lot of squinting. Blood flowed freely. People didn't expect much, so they were happy with what they got. All they wanted was background noise while they got busy with their significant others.\nCowboy Killer might have fit okay in that era. Might have. It's cheaply made, with plenty of fake-looking blood, a threadbare script, and performances that range from wooden to hamminess. People could pull up in their Chevy Novas and smooched while this junk played on the big screen. But here in the 2000s, it's just a crappy horror film that looks like it was made in someone's basement with a legion of blowup dolls. It's the kind of movie that telegraphs a flashback scene by dissolving a scene into and out of pure white.\nNow, there were movies in the 1970s that were so bad that one could almost enjoy them ironically. Many of these movies were directed by legendary schlockmeister Al Adamson, a man who gave us such classics as Blood of Ghastly Horror and Angels' Wild Women. Those movies were really, really bad, but compared with this one they were hotbeds of hilarity.\nDon't believe me? Here's a sample quote: \"You crossed the line like a cow out of order!\" Makes no sense.\nSo some cowboy is running around a small, podunk town killing people for no good reason. A couple of cable guys (!) are trying to find him, because apparently he didn't pay his bill. (Really.) The cops can't track him down; the sheriff fires two of them when they insist on following up on slim leads (yes, he asks for their guns and badges). The town drunk knows all about the killer, but no one believes him. The town's resident psycho killer wants to glom onto the cowboy's fun and games. And there are multiple trips to strip clubs.\nBut none of this is ironic. This is all straightforward. So either it's an extremely subtle, clever joke, or it's really, really awful. Stupefyingly awful. I posit that the former is a theoretical impossibility, because there's not one ounce of cleverness in this picture. There's even a character named Jeffrey Dalmer. Yes, Dalmer. Again, either the makers of this film were riffing off Jeffrey Dahlmer, intentionally misspelling the name, or they simply had no idea how to spell it. And considering the lack of wit throughout the movie, I'll wager on the latter there.\nMovies that are cheaply done can still have some chilling effects - see The Blair Witch Project, for instance. You can do a lot with a little. But not here. In one scene, the killer slams a car hood on a victim's head. Immediately - the first slam! - the woman is dead and a bloody mess. Look, he's not that big; a slam would have knocked her out, perhaps. And not once does she even cry out. And this is after she stupidly put her head under the hood to check her dipstick, on account of the cowboy didn't want to get his hat dirty. Oh boy.\nI also love how the cowboy's \"western\" accent comes and goes. It's there when he says \"podner\" and \"ain't,\" and that's it.\nThis movie is almost exactly like pro wrestling, except with less blood and less-intricate story lines. It's as if the director just followed some people around and told them to improvise every scene, but no one had ever had an acting lesson but thought they were the greatest since, like, Coolio, or something.\nApparently the movie had a budget of $50,000. I spent the entire movie trying to figure out where that money went. It's not in the acting, the directing, the filming, the soundtrack, or the effects. Maybe they blew it all on whoopie cushions and trips to the strip club.\nHere's another sample quote: \"I'm gonna set his horse on fire and then eat it!\" Is that supposed to be a threat? To the horse, maybe.\nI don't know what else to say about this movie. It's an interminable bore, not dumb enough to be funny and not smart enough to be interesting. It's not even smart enough to know it's not very good; it looks like it desperately wants to be taken seriously, but it's not pretty enough for the Westminster Show, let alone the prom.\n*"}

A weird malady has spread across an unnamed city that causes \u201cwhite blindness\u201d in the afflicted. Moore plays the wife of an eye doctor (Mark Ruffalo) who fakes having the disease so that she be quarantined with her husband (and the other early sufferers). The patients quickly learn that they\u2019re on their own and that any attempts to leave the facility will result in their being shot to death. As the only sighted person, Moore literally sees the inmates/patients devolve into misery and must somehow lead a small band of them to the presumed safety of the outside world.\nThe movie begins rather strongly, as a young man is suddenly blinded while driving on a busy city street. Disoriented, he is helped by a passerby, who takes him home but steals his car. Meanwhile, an ophthalmologist\u2019s office begins to fill up with people experiencing this odd blindness, not one of inky blackness but of complete whiteness. The following morning, the doctor wakes up with the same blindness, and the only way Mrs. Eye Doctor can go with him is by pretending she too has the (apparently) infectious disease.\nThe patients are kept in maximum-security barracks and are given sparse amounts of food that they must dole out to each other. But that\u2019s the extent of their outside help; armed guards surround the buildings and shoot to kill anyone who tries to leave. (Lest they, you know, infect normal people.) So it\u2019s not long before the denizens of one section (ward) decide they want more than their share, and anarchy ensues, which is compounded by nearly everyone\u2019s lack of sight. (The doctor\u2019s wife \u2013 everyone\u2019s unnamed \u2013 keeps her own condition a secret from everyone except her husband.) The movie is a metaphor for the hatred within human beings for one another; it seeks to show that when the chips are down, we are just animals, even if we suffer the same indignities, because each of us wishes to be better than the next, to dominate. We are not, the movie argues, a society built solely on equality. It also seeks to show that there are different kinds of blindness: physical blindness, and the blindness of man to the suffering of his fellows.\nAlthough the film is exquisitely well shot \u2013 from desolate city streets to the unencumbered chaos within the compound\u2019s walls \u2013 it\u2019s alternately slow moving and predictable. It\u2019s easy to see what will happen once the victims are quarantined, and it\u2019s even easier to see that the doctor\u2019s wife will be the one to lead some of them out of the morass. Although Moore is excellent as always (as are Ruffalo, Danny Glover as an eye-patch-wearer, and Alice Braga as a blind hooker), her character seems to be less a victim and accidental leader than a chosen heroine, which runs contrary to the theme of everyday people simply trying to survive without sight. Moore\u2019s character, the only character with sight, is presented as being a good person, but she is very slow to stop what are obviously Very Bad Things being done to the blind.\nAside from the blindness angle, there isn\u2019t much here to separate this film from other personal-disaster films (to differentiate them from natural-disaster films, which would include earthquakes, tidal waves, and tornados), such as movies about plagues (28 Days Later), zombies (Dawn of the Dead), or infectious diseases (Outbreak). The idea that people would turn on each other even though they suffer together is not new; neither is the idea of a society (in this case, an entire city) abandoning those who all have some sort of disease. And because these ideas aren\u2019t new, Blindness isn\u2019t as compelling as it ought to be; the characters are generally one dimensional and unlikeable, so this isn\u2019t even much of a feel-good movie. To tell the truth, it\u2019s a bit of a lifeless downer, although the ending makes up for it a little.\nA final note: The American Council of the Blind said, in deploring the movie, that \u201cblind people do not behave like uncivilized, animalized creatures.\u201d That\u2019s simply a silly statement. Anyone can behave as an uncivilized, animalized creature, particularly if they are treated as animals and quarantined from \u201cnormal\u201d society (which was the point of the director, Fernando Meirelles); to believe that blind people are not susceptible to anger, despair, and revenge is to believe that blindness somehow connotes angelic heroism, which is unfair toward blind people as well."}

Aided by a cynical alley cat and a hamster in a transportation ball, Bolt must fight the forces of gravity and the other laws of physics to be reunited with his Penny in this sweet, charming Disney animated film.\nIt\u2019s encouraging to see a good Disney-only animated film for a change. Bolt does what an animated movie should do \u2013 it has a quick pace, it\u2019s humanistic, it\u2019s funny, and it\u2019s adventurous. Oh, and there\u2019s character growth. It\u2019s no surprise that the intended audience \u2013 little kids, not me \u2013 found this entertaining, on average.\nBolt, an American White Shephard, escapes from his trailer on the set of his hit television series and finds himself shipped to the East Coast. Thinking that his Penny is in imminent danger from the man with the green eye (played with the usual maniacal glee of Malcom McDowell), Bolt tries to use his super powers \u2013 super speed, the ability to shoot lasers from his eyes, a Super Bark \u2013 to rescue her. Of course, since he\u2019s just a normal dog, these super powers don\u2019t work, but they do lead to some hilarious physical comedy.\nOne departure this movie offers is the casting of unknowns in key roles. Mittens the Cat is played by Susie Essman, and the scene-stealing Rhino the Hamster is voiced by Mark Walton. Who and who? And yet both actors are perfect for the roles. Sometimes it pays to cast someone based purely on their fit for a character, rather than hiring a \u201cname\u201d actor and letting their celebrity overtake the character completely. Which is how Disney did it for years and years; when the studio enjoyed its resurgence in 1989 with The Litter Mermaid, it cast Buddy Hackett amid character actors, and the landscape of animation changed. Next thing you know, you had Robin Williams in Aladdin and James Earle Jones in The Lion King. Not that these were bad casting choices, but they represented a change from olden times, for the most part.\nTravolta is excellent as the intrepid, resilient, and initially deluded Bolt, a canine who learns that his super powers come from within him. Why, he had the power to save Penny all along! All he had to do was click his heart together, and.. Oh, never mind. The point is, Bolt learns that help can come from unlikely sources (a cat!), and comic relief is always welcome (a hamster!) And Cyrus \u2013 who has limited screen time, compared with Travolta \u2013 is spot on as the innocent Penny, who pines for her lost pup. In fact, if it weren\u2019t for an extended musical montage (sung by Jenny Lewis), this would have been a great movie instead of merely a very good one, but you can\u2019t please everyone."}

Sacha Baron Cohen returns as the titular Austrian gay fashion maven, out to seek his fortune in America but with no idea how. Baron Cohen's knack for eliciting responses from an unsuspecting public remains unparalleled, but his ambushes produce more discomfort (on the part of the viewer) than laughs.\nBruno is blackballed from the Austrian fashion scene when he attempts to show an outfit made of velcro. Off to America! His Pygmy lover decides not to join him, but his assistant Lutz does, sort of in the same role as Ken Davitian from Borat. Bruno's escapades include being an extra (failure), creating a celebrity interview show (more failure), trying to create a sex tape with Ron Paul (a full-course meal of failure at Failure Hut), and so on. Bruno desperately wants to be famous, so he tries to glom onto a charitable cause, but he can't find one sexy enough that hasn't already been taken. Undaunted, he goes the Madonna-Jolie route and adopts an African child.\nI want to pause there, because the subsequent scene is the funniest in the film. On The Richard Bey Show (think a less-classy Jerry Springer), Bruno appears as a single parent. To the shock and horror of the studio audience, Bruno brings out his new infant, whom he's named O.J. (no joke is too old for Baron Cohen here) and whom he swapped for - yes - an iPod. Gasps of horror from the audience. Bruno is undeterred and presses on, showing pictures of himself with the little boy in - shall we say - interesting situations, such as in a Jacuzzi filled with naked men. And then Child Protection shows up on the set, because if it's one thing The Richard Bey Show is known for, it's doing the right thing.\nOther scenes include a swingers' party (as Bruno attempts to go straight), a hunting party (ditto), National Guard barracks, and a meeting with an actual terrorist, Ayman Abu Aita. The latter is to set up a kidnapping of Bruno himself; he thinks that if he's kidnapped by terrorists, he'll become famous. He's right, of course, and by this point in the movie you wish Abu Aita had taken him up on his offer instead of having him escorted from his tent - and the country - for saying that Osama bin Laden looks like a dirty wizard or a homeless Santa. That was amusing, particularly since (I assume) Abu Aita wasn't in on the joke.\nWhat made Borat so successful wasn't just the shock factor, it was the honest (if racist) reactions of the so-called everyday Americans. And both needed to be present for true comedy to exist; it's funny when someone does something shocking that exposes the weakness of another person, isn't it? But Bruno is not entirely successful in this regard. Because you know Baron Cohen's modus operandi, you can see where things are going in each scene, meaning you're looking toward the endgame rather than experiencing the current scene. And although there are some shocking moments, most of them appear in the trailers and commercials for the movie. And a great deal more scenes are simply gross and shock on a merely physical level. (In fact, be warned - there is plenty of frontal male nudity, although the sex scenes are all tastefully blurred.) Bruno is a bit of a disappointment, given the viral success of Borat, but how could have it not been? Baron Cohen depended largely on the naivet\u00e9 of his victims in the first one, and too many people saw it for Bruno to have much of a chance. Because even if the victims didn't know what was coming, the audience sure does"}

In this sixth entry, Harry has to deal not only with Death Eaters and He Who Shall Not Be Named (coughVoldemortcough) but also teenage hormones, which seem banal to us old folks but rather consume the entirety of the demographic audience's existence.\nBut it's a testament to director Peter Yates and writer Steve Kloves that the so-called down-time scenes aren't dull; in fact, they're invigorating, sweet, sincere looks at teenage life, which is sort of difficult to do when you're middle aged.\nTo be sure, the movie is darker than any of its predecessors, just as with the books. As the stories have progressed, the issues Harry faces increase in intensity and maturity - as his beloved Professor Dumbledore says, he must once again ask too much of his young charge. But for a change, the adults in Harry's world are beginning to treat him more like an adult and less like a pestering child. They share secrets with him, seek his counsel, and trust him to do heavy lifting - that is, they don't shunt him off to the corner while they fight bad guys themselves. (Of course, this is partly out of necessity, as so many of the good guys are being picked off.) But the frivolity and child-like wonder of the earlier films is now long gone, as the filmmakers (correctly, really) assume that the audience is well familiar with the characters and the story lines. Less time is spent on exposition and introducing us to strange new creatures (mermaids, dragons, etc.).\nThe plot: Voldemort, freed at the end of the fifth film, is assembling his Death Eaters, who attack London. Meanwhile, Dumbledore has asked Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) to return to the school as the Potions teacher. Dumbledore wants to gain access to an old memory of Slughorn that may hold the key to Voldemort's plans, and Harry (naturally) is asked to get that memory from the reluctant teacher. Meanwhile, Hermione likes Ron but doesn't want to admit it. Ron falls for a clingy Lavender Brown, and Harry has eyes for Ron's sister, Ginny. The kids are at that age - in the fifth film, we saw hormonal hints, but more from the girls' side of things, and here the score is evened up a tad. The thing is, though, as much as those of us far removed from our teen years are not interested in teen issues, Yates and Kloves make the relationships and interactions so spot-on honest that we can't help but get swept away in the sentiments.\nThe entire cast is outstanding, giving us a sort of old-shoe comfortability with their work here, but I wanted to point out the crazed, perfectly over-the-top work of Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, the most insane of all the Death Eaters, the witch who killed Harry's godfather, Sirius. Bonham Carter is devilish, part Bride of Frankenstein and part, I dunno, Aileen Wuornos. Broadbent is also a welcome addition as Slughorn, vulnerable, pompous, a bit grandstanding, a gadfly of students (he likes to \"collect\" portraits of the best ones). A students' groupie, really. Slughorn is pivotal in unlocking Voldemort's secret. Alan Rickman, again back as the nebulously moral Severus Snape, offers a delicious, multilayered performance that keeps you guessing throughout the entire movie.\nThe movie features some of the best cinematography and sets in the series, too. Hogwarts is shown at times, as is The Three Broomsticks at Hogsmeade, but Harry and Dumbledore also travel to a distant cave, and there's a Quidditch match (hooray!), and the Weasley twins have now - having left Hogwarts in a blaze of glory at the end of the fifth film - opened their own shop at the now-dilapidated Diagon Alley.\nYou cannot be bored with this film. Yates' pacing is top notch, as he slows the movie down only when necessary - i.e., to build drama or inject humor. Things move at a breakneck speed, just as in the book, and everything is so perfectly laid out that you don't even realize they've slowed down. If you're a guy you'll assume the romance will be pointless and dumb and just filler, but I assure you it's none of those. Despite all your efforts, your heart will break a couple of times in this movie, once for those in and out of love, and once for the big secret near the end of the movie.\nA final word about the adaptation itself. It has been a little while since I read the book, but I don't think they took out too much that should have remained, if any. The movie is two and a half hours long, after all, and the books got progressively longer. There are a couple of extended scenes that are missing from the movie, but there's good reason: One is a battle scene from the end of the book; this was cut because the next book also contains a huge battle scene, and the producers wanted to avoid having the two films look too similar. The other scene, rumor has it, will appear at the beginning of the next film.\nAll in all, Harry Potter's sixth adventure is possibly the best of them all. Stunning sets are complemented by achingly real acting by not only Britain's most decorated but also by the youthful main cast. I saw this in a theater full of teenagers whom, I had feared, wouldn't keep quiet for the movie. They did keep quiet except when the script told them to cheer and gasp and jump in fright. (This is an intense PG-rated film.) The movie was so well received that people cheered when the credits came up, which is not something you see often nowadays. The ending - not in the book - is sweet, portentous, bittersweet, and elegant."}

Owen is no Jason Bourne; he's not even Daniel Craig, although he certainly seems intent on doing something or other. Watts tries her best, but her assistant district attorney (what, was the DA too busy for a multinational bank plot?) isn't given much to do other than run around and get hit by a car.\nThe plot has something to do with an international bank (timely subject) called the IBBC that's somehow gotten into the business of buying large-scale weaponry and selling it to anyone and everyone. Why? Not to make money, Interpol Agent Salinger (Owen) is told, but to create debt. Whoever owns the debt runs the world. I thought it was whoever had the guns ran the world. Or whoever had the money ran the world. But no, it's whoever owns the debt. Salinger and NY ADA Eleanor Whitman (Watts) team up to criss cross the globe to track down the bad guy responsible with the help of some of the boys in NYPD blue, an Italian political candidate, and hundreds of other extras.\nThe biggest problem with The International is that it aims high and fails. It's not a good spy thriller. It's not a good conspiracy thriller, either. Director Tom Tykwer uses a whirlwind style that moves everyone about so rapidly - and abetted by a complex plot - in an effort to mask potential plot holes. Shot in such exotic locations as Milan, Saxony, Istanbul, and the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, the movie is pretty to look at, but it doesn't always hold up to close scrutiny. There are too many bad guys, and none of them feels cold or oily enough to be a suitable villain.\nLook, I like Clive Owen, and he's believable in getting beat up and racing about and trying to use his Interpol brain. He's not some superhero action guy who benefits from a lot of cross cutting (see him race toward point A! See him get to point A seconds later from a different angle!); he looks like he's doing his own stunts, which is all I ask. But he lacks the braininess of Matt Damon's Bourne and the smoldering intensity (TM) of Craig's James Bond. He's not a burning manly fire; he's a Sterno burner. He's James Bland. Still, there's something to be said for being inoffensive. And that something is \"boring.\" Then there's Naomi Watts, who's really a terrific actress - check her out in Mulholland Drive; she should have been Oscarfied for it - but here she's only a little bit better than decoration. For much of the film, she's presented as a partner to Owen - the NY DA's office working with Interpol - but by the end, it's all Clive Owen's show. Had writer Eric Singer continued the partnership for the duration of the film, this might have been a more interesting thriller, but Watts' third-act absence turned the plot pedestrian.\nBah. You know what was neat, though? There's an extended fight scene at the Guggenheim that was more compelling than anything else in the film. The museum looked great, even while getting shot up. Sort of like Naomi Watts."}

His mom enlists the LAPD to find him, and five months later they come up with a lost child. The mother quickly grasps that the kid isn't her missing son, but the LAPD will have none of it. Outraged, Christine Collins takes on the entire police department in an effort to get them to look for her son, much to the detriment of her own welfare.\nOh, the arrogant LAPD! They foist a boy, obviously the wrong child, on poor Mrs. Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) and practically force her to shower affection on the kid. Then they wash their hands of the matter, even when Collins protests that the kid's not hers. This attitude gets her thrown into a women's sanitarium, because you just didn't talk back to the LAPD in 1928, especially if you were a woman. Especially if you were a single woman who was pointing out a huge mistake on the part of the LAPD.\nLuckily, Christine has a powerful ally, the Reverend Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), who broadcasts a weekly sermon excoriating the police for corruption and other misdeeds. Briegleb is instrumental in winning Christine's release, but the battle's only just begun: the cops are still crooked, and she is still without her son.\nConcurrent to Christine's problems, we also follow the story of the real kidnapper and of the upper management of the LAPD. What begins as a slight cover-up on the part of the all-powerful police in order to placate a testy public and press turns into a disaster, all because Christine Collins wouldn't give up.\nThe movie is never lacking for emotional realism. First of all, you completely empathize with Christine Collins, a woman who refuses to be a victim. Her goal isn't to bring the police department down, and it's not even to exact some kind of vengeance (which might just be a way for her to get over her son's kidnapping). Her goal is simply to get her son back.\nAngelina Jolie plays Christine Collins and is, in a word, outstanding, and she earned a Oscar nomination for this movie. Jolie's Collins is not homely - you can't completely lose that beauty, even if you're playing a somewhat dowdy 1920s mom - but her looks don't get her anywhere in this movie. To tell the truth, her looks are never even mentioned, not even in a snide comment by the cops (\"Just sit over here, cutie, while we men take care of things\"). When Collins comes home to find her son's gone, we feel the anguish she feels. It doesn't feel forced, and we don't feel manipulated, and that's at least because of Jolie herself.\nOne odd little complaint, though - why is everything so dark? Was the sun dimmer in 1928? Even in broad daylight, everyone seems to be half in shadows, which made me squint most of the time, thus giving me a headache. Was director Clint Eastwood trying for some kind of period moodiness? It's not needed for most of the scenes, although the mental hospital should, by definition, be poorly lit.\nAs Christine Collins tenaciously clings to the idea that her son may still be alive, the movie also grabs a hold of your heartstrings and never lets go. But neither does Eastwood try to manipulate us toward an inevitable conclusion; he doesn't pluck those heartstrings so much as gently caress them, ambiguously leading us in multiple directions. Collins' predicament feels terrifyingly real: the aching loss of her only child and her own violent incarceration in a sadistic \"hospital.\" Changeling is frightening not only because of the blistering account of evil cops and doctors but also, and most hauntingly, because of the horrible anguish and despair Collins feels as she fights the system while maintaining her resolute belief that her boy will be found."}

Alleged director Michael Bay, a firm believer in the throw-everything-at-the-wall theory of film-making, manages to overwhelm the senses with a teeth-rattling soundtrack and a blistering, epilepsy-inducing barrage of metallic imagery. Oh, there's a story in there, something about preventing an evil robot from destroying the sun, but it's almost completely irrelevant.\nSince the movie is a direct follow up to the last Transformers film, some background is necessary. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBoeuf) is preparing to go to college, away from his new sweetheart Mikaela (Megan Fox) and his new alien robot best friend, Bumblebee. Meanwhile, Optimus Prime (a good robot) is helping the world's armies take on stray Decepticons (bad robots), who are trying to revive their old leader Megatron, find Sam, and aid another bad robot named The Fallen (see what they did there?).\nMost of the scenes involve Sam (and Mikaela, and others in their posse) running from place to place, getting shot at by apparently the slowest giant robots in the universe. But not like in films like National Treasure or Angels and Demons, where a mystery was being solved and the protagonist was running from place to place because time was almost up for them to solve said mystery. More like running around just so that more robot battle scenes could be included. I mean, it doesn't really have to have a point, right? One big problem is that the robots are sort of hard to distinguish from one another. Some are pretty easy, like Optimus Prime (he's blue and red) and Bumblebee (he's yellow), and the Twins Mudflap and Skids, or even The Fallen, who has an elongated faceplate. There are gray-metal robots who are Decepticons (colorless = evil?), but then there are some who are Autobots. Add to this confusion the fact that the fight scenes move at a breakneck pace, so even if you can tell who's fighting whom, you really can't tell what specifically is being done.\nThe movie is also about an hour too long (it's two and a half hours total). There are too many battle scenes anyway, and there are too many characters to keep track of. Slice it down to a manageable running time and chop out some secondary characters - keep the battles to just the most obvious players - and maybe there would be a coherent, cohesive movie. But Michael Bay directed this, and he's known for doing the opposite of what a good filmmaker would do.\nAs for the acting... well, I don't want to be negative. I'm kidding, of course I do. Being negative is easier than being positive. But it's double-plus easier for a film like this, because it's so clich\u00e9d and so overwrought. The acting is subpar; everyone hams it up, probably because they don't want to be overshadowed by robots. (They are anyway.) LaBoeuf is not a good actor, never has been. He's not a good action-movie type, frankly; you don't look at him and see hero, you see nincompoop. He doesn't inspire so much as react. This was never more evident than in the latest Indiana Jones movie, when sixtysomething Harrison Ford - not a great actor, but an appealing one - was far more convincing than LaBoeuf. You're supposed to look at LaBoeuf and think he's a guy next door, and instead you look at him and think he's a self-aggrandizing little twit. Or maybe that's just me.\nMegan Fox is in this movie basically to look pretty - check out, as I did, the endless pans over her young, lithe body, and you know exactly who's in the intended audience. (Note: It's not sixty-year-old women.) The appropriately named Fox is all pouty lips and gleaming teeth, and she's likable enough, but she's given little to do other than dote on LaBoeuf awkwardly.\nAs for the rest of the cast, it's a clash of acting styles. John Turturro returns as Agent Simmons, and he's wackier than ever; Ramon Rodriguez plays Sam's new college roommate, web entrepreneur Leo, and he's deranged and a wuss. Sam's parents are played by Kevin Dunn and Julie White, who shamelessly mug - White's character in particular is needlessly loony. She was probably supposed to be comic relief, but she comes off as annoying.\nThis isn't a great thrill ride, as the previews might lead you to believe. It's not even a Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. It's more like the It's a Small World ride, a ride that ceaselessly repeats the same refrain just to irritate the pants off you, figuratively speaking, resulting in a desperate wish for it all to be over."}

I thought that, because it was a remake by an explosion-happy director (Tony Scott) and starred ultraham John Travolta, it couldn't possibly be all that interesting. Maybe a mild diversion, but those are a dime a dozen during the summer. But hey, big shock! It's actually pretty tense, with just enough twistiness to fascinate without seeming implausible.\nOf course, the biggest reason the movie succeeds is Denzel Washington. Washington plays a disgraced (investigation pending) transit executive who's currently slumming as the control chief. On his shift, naturally, a 1:23 train out of Pelham (New York City) suddenly stops in the middle of its run, and a hijacker demands $10 million to be delivered in exactly one hour, or passengers start dying unnaturally.\nWhat makes this a little more than your typical cat-and-mouse game is the undercurrent of what's gotten Washington character into hot water, as well as Travolta's character's actual motives. After all, he's just grabbed a subway full of hostages, but obviously he can't just ride the car to Cuba, or something. He has to have an escape plan.\nWashington and Travolta play off each other very nicely, with Washington's flawless portrayal of a flawed man far more convincing than Travolta's garden-variety unhinged wacko. Essentially, Washington was good enough to counterbalance Travolta's overacting. (Is he crazy, or is he just cleverly acting crazy? Who cares?) Washington's Walter Garber is unsure of himself, an actual Everyman thrust into a madman's master plan. It's roles like these that separate Washington from people like, say, Tom Cruise, guys who can play really only one character, the Man Who Knows Everything. Walter Garber not only isn't a \"seize the day\" kind of person, he shies away from confrontations he knows he can't win.\nAlso worth noting are John Turturro (as a hostage negotiator displaced by Washington, since Travolta won't talk to anyone else) and James Gandolfini (as Hizzoner, finally playing a mayor who's not a complete nitwit). Gone is the whimsical naming convention from the first, in which Robert Shaw named his comrades after colors, which was swiped by Quentin Tarantino for Reservoir Dogs. There are some changes from the original, true, but they don't seem contrived; for example, Walter Matthau was a transit cop in the 1974 version, not some under-investigation suit.\nThe action is tense throughout, especially since you assume that the hijackers are going to have to murder someone at some point (otherwise, why have a deadline?) Somehow, the movie manages to be gripping and realistic without being over the top. There are some minor bouts of nonsense (did we really need to know that Garber needed to bring home a gallon of milk?), and maybe in the final 20 minutes or so it's a little by the numbers in its approach to action, but overall it's not bad at all. It's certainly a lot better than I'd expect a John Travolta movie to be, but maybe that's because he's the bad guy here, and they're practically expected to be over the top."}

Sam Raimi\u2019s horror tale is very stylish, as expected, although it lags during the quieter moments, particularly when Justin Long (as Lohman\u2019s boyfriend) is around.\nChristine Brown (Lohman) is trying to get promoted to assistant bank manager by her officious boss (played by David Paymer), who favors Christine\u2019s brown-nosing coworker Stu. One fine day, a woman (Lorna Raver) pleads with Christine for help with her mortgage; knowing her boss wouldn\u2019t want her to grant another extension, Christine denies the woman, thus incurring her wrath. Said wrath includes a brutal attack in an underground parking garage (nothing good ever happens there in movies, you know), as well as at Christine\u2019s house.\nWatching this movie demands a certain amount of disbelief suspension, more so even for your typical horror movie. At one point, the old woman puts her fist through Christine\u2019s mouth, with no repercussions. Another time, Christine actually hurls an office supply into the woman\u2019s eyeball. Again, no real damage. In fact, after that first physical encounter in the parking garage, both women probably should have died three or four times.\nAs I mentioned, the movie lags whenever there\u2019s no true horror going on, as if Raimi wasn\u2019t quite sure what to do with all of his secondary characters. Lohman has good chemistry with Long, but that\u2019s about the only positive: Long himself is wooden, a lightweight even by horror-movie standards, so although the two actors seem to connect, their scenes together seem flat, almost forced. And that\u2019s not all of it, either. There\u2019s an (understandably) awkward dinner with Long\u2019s parents, a high-minded, upper-crust family, that doesn\u2019t resonate as much as if ought to. You pay more attention to Long\u2019s jerkish parents (particularly his snotty mother) than to Lohman\u2019s curse-related issues.\nIt\u2019s important to note, though, that the horror scenes are unbelievably scary. The film opens with an electric scene in which a young boy is literally dragged to the bowels of hell before his parents\u2019 eyes, all because he swiped a gypsy woman\u2019s necklace. And every action scene thereafter is powerful, gross, stylish stuff. (In fact, for a PG-13 movie, the scenes are very intense - I think standards have changed just a tad over the past couple of decades.) Bottom line: It\u2019s a good-looking horror movie with many genuinely terrifying moments that are offset only slightly by Justin Long\u2019s annoying performance and character interactions that lag and seem out of place."}

Meanwhile, an unstable car salesman tries to cope with the death of his wife and the subsequent silent treatment of his young daughter. The two story lines dovetail in and out of each other\u2019s orbit nicely, with the result a movie that\u2019s at turns joyous and devastating.\nMarian (Carrie Preston) has written a book that has little plot and no conflict, so her mentor (Auston Pendleton) suggests she create some by killing off a main character. But doing this triggers a whole mess of complications, not the least of which is that the character somehow cheats death and winds up in the same world as Marian, albeit wandering around in his tighty whities. Bob the car salesman (Reg Rogers) is gamely trying to keep his act together, as well as his job, while also trying to connect with his daughter Mimi (Lena Lamer), who has not spoken since her mother died.\nGoing into the plot in any more detail might give away key points that are best savored as they occur, so I\u2019ll stop right there. Let\u2019s talk about the cast. Preston is outstanding as the novice writer, desperately trying to write herself out of a corner. She wants very badly to succeed, but she\u2019s hesitant about such an extreme solution. I thought Preston showed just the right combination of spunk, cleverness, and vulnerability. Her equal is Rogers as the not-all-there Bob. Rogers is so good, you\u2019re not sure if he\u2019s intentionally trying to be strange or is simply overacting. It\u2019s the former - Bob\u2019s own vulnerability is masked by a veneer of unfounded optimism, and his boss (Richard Masur), who\u2019s given Bob many chances to succeed, is nearing the end of his rope. Bob\u2019s problem is that he\u2019s just not a conventional salesman; instead of selling cars, Bob tells his customers to go home and spend time with their families. He\u2019s sort of an existential salesman, if anything, and Rogers is commanding and believable in a difficult role.\nOh, but that ain\u2019t all. The supposed-to-be-killed-off protagonist, Humkin (Michael Chernus) is a man-child who has lived (in the unfinished book) with his arrested-development brother for years on a landlocked boat, subsisting on milk and cereal and speaking in curiously appealing, innocent speech. Humkin somehow makes it to the real world, where his affable personality serves him quite well. Again, just what Humkin does in the so-called real world isn\u2019t something that should be revealed here. But the point is that Chernus is a sheer, buoyant delight in what\u2019s an award-caliber performance.\nLovely by Surprise is really a sweet film, but it can be tough to watch at time. It can\u2019t really be pigeonholed as a comedy or a drama, although there are some laugh-out-loud moments. The brilliant characterizations (by writer-director Kirt Gunn), fully realized by a capable cast, elevate this from a mere slice-of-life art-house film to a solid, heart-breaking masterpiece."}

Trouble is, a little kid named Russell (Jordan Nagai) is also along for the ride, which doesn\u2019t quite play out the way Carl intends it to. This Disney/Pixar instaclassic is a lot of fun, especially in 3D, with charming, realistic characters, sweeping vistas, and a straight-arrow message that\u2019s neither muddled nor heavyhanded.\nNow, you gotta know this upfront: I love 3D animated films. It\u2019s not like the old days, where the makers would try so hard to make the 3D exciting and amazing that they forgot to make a movie behind the effects. What happens nowadays is that the creators write an awesome, fun movie and then toss dollops of 3D effects to accentuate the story, rather than distract from it. (Or, as sometimes would happen, detract from it.) So maybe I was an easy mark, but I thought Up was outstanding. Ed Asner, as the cranky old man who\u2019s lost his zest for life, turns in a pitch-perfect performance that\u2019s both endearing and curmudgeonly. Of course, the animation is so detailed that you can count the hairs on Carl\u2019s chin as the days progress, but the Pixar gang did a great job in showing the various expressions on the faces of the human characters here, something I think they\u2019ve been slow to develop well. (The toys in Toy Story, for example, looked great, but Sid the neighbor kid did not appear to be fully formed.) The story itself is an adventure on the order of Indiana Jones, if Indy were a septuagenarian with the physical prowess of an eggplant. The unlikely duo winds up in South America, all right, but they encounter more than just trees and rocks. Every animated film needs a villain, and here we get the luminous Christopher Plummer as a thought-dead old-time explorer who\u2019s been holed up at the very spot Carl wishes to visit. Plummer does evil pretty well, I think, especially for a Canadian. (They\u2019re kindly, peaceful folk, you see.) Compared with recent 3D movies, I\u2019d put Up a little higher up than Monsters versus Aliens, but not much. The sweet ending, although expected, packs just as strong an emotional punch as it would if you couldn\u2019t see it coming. And certainly the intended audience for this movie won\u2019t care about nuances; the kids in the theater where I saw this raved about it, keeping in awed silence for much of the film - except when Big Fun Wonderful Things were happening, when they erupted with raucous jubilation."}

You get the feeling that Maher desperately wants to be like Michael Moore, who - love him or hate him - works hard to prove his points. Maher seems content with just doing cut-rate standup.\nThere really isn\u2019t a lot else that can be said about a psuedodocumentary about religion. Maher can\u2019t keep out of his own way, constantly interrupting his interview subjects with witless, almost mirthless humor so that they can\u2019t even make their points cogently. Where Moore might allow his subjects to rant on and on, allowing them to either make their case or his own for him, Maher doesn\u2019t seem sure whether he wants to laugh at his subjects or discuss religion with them. He comes off as abrasive, obnoxious, and thoroughly condescending, and it\u2019s the latter that really kills the mood.\nMaher\u2019s lofty pontifications would carry more weight had he exhibited even the tiniest amount of empathy for his opponents\u2019 - and essentially everyone in the movie is his opponent, save for his film crew - point of view.

All three elements contribute to form an overblown, frantic mess that offers little mystery.\nRobert Langdon (Hanks), the \u201csymbologist\u201d (not a real position) of The Da Vinci Code, is again the hero here, called into action by the Vatican itself, as four of its esteemed cardinals have been, um, cardinalnapped, just as an Conclave to choose the new Pope is about to begin. At the same time, an experiment at Switzerland\u2019s CERN research center has produced a nifty new substance called antimatter - and it\u2019s been stolen! By, it appears, whoever kidnapped the cardinal. The antimatter\u2019s storage container must be found before midnight, or else the battery will run out, and everyone will be doomed.\nSo it\u2019s a race against the clock as Langdon and a beautiful CERN scientist (Ayelet Zurer) try to locate the container and save the cardinals. The mismatched duo - will they fall in love? - must match wits with some unseen wacko religious extremist, as well as the head of the Swiss Guard (Stellan Skarsgard). They\u2019re helped by the youthful Camerlengo (Ewan McGregor), i.e., the Pope\u2019s Helper fellow, and the chief of Vatican City\u2019s police force (Pierfrancisco Favino) - or are they? The bad guy could be a good guy in disguise, right? Or did I just blow your mind? One thing that did bother me a lot about this movie - aside from the faceless, let\u2019s-run-from-clue-to-clue plot device - is that for a movie that\u2019s supposed to be peopled with Serious Folks who revere Important Things, sort of like Indiana Jones and his \u201cit belongs in a museum!\u201d mantra, there\u2019s a LOT of desecration of religious artifacts, often for no good reason at all. Example: Langdon and his gal pal get access to the Vatican\u2019s archives (of course they do) to look at one of Galileo\u2019s original texts. The only one remaining in existence, right? In lieu of translating, they just rip a page out. Much light is made of the mysterious archives, and although I\u2019m not remotely religious, this struck me as particularly disrespectful. Was Howard lampooning the Church, or was he trying to tell a good mystery tale? He succeeded only in doing the former, which is a huge disappointment.\nHanks isn\u2019t bad - better than he was in The Da Vinci Code, anyway - and his hair is less distracting here. He\u2019s every bit as intrepid as you\u2019d expect a Harvard professor to be in investigating a murder, which I\u2019m sure is something that happens all the time to Harvard professors. Probably more than for Yale professors, anyway. So he\u2019s not the problem, or even a problem. An issue, though, is that the characters are so thinly drawn. I mean, when you see two characters who seem a little dodgy, you know one of them will turn out to be not so dodgy, and maybe even a Good Guy after all. \u201cTwists\u201d like that can be spotted too far in advance for my tastes.\nIf you took the core plot of \u201c24\u2033 and stripped away most of the tension and all of the character depth and added sacrilege, you\u2019d get Angels and Demons. The book, as they say, is a heck of a lot better than the vapid movie version, but you probably assumed that anyway. What you might not have realized is that although this book was a lot better than the Da Vinci Code book, the movie is only marginally better than the DVC on film."}

Wood, Jr.\nThe story is that crackpot scientist Rick Marshall (Will Ferrell) has invented an apparatus that will allow him to travel to parallel dimensions. When he and a comely Cambridge lass named Holly (Anna Friel) test the device, they're sucked into a vortex (along with a survivalist tour guide, played by Danny McBride of Tropic Thunder) that deposits them into the titular land, which is populated by motels, gas stations, knick knacks, dinosaurs, ape people, and lizard people.\nThe trio can't get back to their own time and place without locating the now-missing device, and they run into an ally in Cha-Ka (Jorma Taccone of Saturday Night Live) as well as the nefarious Sleestaks, lizard-like creatures with multiple sets of teeth and nasty dispositions.\nIt's tough to know where to begin with this one. The TV series was admittedly awful; it's interesting now only in the so-bad-it's-good sense, but the movie does not fully embrace the hoakiness of the series, which might have worked. (That is, if this was a knowing self-parody along the lines of The Brady Bunch Movie.) But neither is it an all-out comedic take on the serious-minded sci-fi show, which also might have worked, given the comic pedigree of Will Ferrell. So by not committing fully to either venue of entertainment, the movie fails twice.\nThe laughs aren't just scattered, they're almost completely absent. Ferrell, who has excellent comic timing and can be genuinely funny (see him on Funny or Die) is really bad here, as if he himself doesn't fully believe in the movie. As a result, Ferrell's performance looks awkward and completely controlled. This is a man who can play slapstick (Old School) and serious (Stranger than Fiction), and here he's sort of caught in the middle. He's not helped by McBride, who was so good in Tropic Thunder, mostly because the writers (Chris Henchy and Dennis McNicholas) weren't sure if his Will should be intelligent or just some doofus. That sort of inconsistency is to expected in movies in which there are many writers, but not only two.\nRounding out the trio is Friel, who's improbably gorgeous - why is she interested in Will Ferrell? Yes, of course they're a potential romance - and an obvious ripoff of Rachel Weisz in the Mummy movies. She's prettier than Rick Marshall, she's smarter than Rick Marshall, and naturally here she's deferential to the wisdom of Rick Marshall as well, unlike Weisz's strong Evvie. It's clear she's in this picture as cheesecake; witness the early scene in which she rips off her pants (leaving herself in short shorts) in order to, I don't even remember. See what I mean? Or the numerous times when characters grope her.\nLand of the Lost isn't silly fun, escapist entertainment that's just meant to be, not mean anything. It's sort of like Journey to the Center of the Earth if it were made without an adventuring lad like Brendan Fraser. Will Ferrell, funny as he is, has no business being in this movie at all."}
< {"rating": "8", "date": "10 May 2009", "title_id": "tt0796366", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "Movie meets needs of many, few", "content": "In this captivating origins story about James Kirk and the Enterprise crew, J.J. Abrams expertly dodges the issue of overfamiliarity and delivers a tight, action-packed, eminently thrilling tale.\nI expected a lot out of this movie, and to tell the truth I found the trailers and previews pretty mediocre. Nothing about them made me really want to see the film; it was as if the trailers were trying to manage the expectations of the intended audience. But here's the rub: Chris Pine, who plays Kirk, is a lot better than I thought he'd be - not a caricature of William Shatner, just a precursor to him, much like Ewan McGregor in Star Wars Episode 1, but with more subtlety.\nKirk is introduced to us at his actual birth, moments after his father - very temporarily a Starfleet captain - sacrifices himself so that his entire crew, including his wife and newborn, may survive. Later events in the whiz kid's life inform his later character, the charm, intelligence, and dare taking that we all expect from James Tiberius Kirk.\nKirk meets Spock, played by Zachary Quinto, at the Academy, where the latter designs the simulation that all prospective cadets must engage. The two lock horns when Kirk manages to defeat the simulation by rather unorthodox means, and that would typically be it for our young hero, but a sudden threat has been detected at the planet Vulcan, and all of the cadets, even Kirk, are quickly dispatched.\nThroughout the movie, the two main characters - we're talking Spock and Kirk here - must somehow evolve as, well, people, much as they did throughout the original series' run. Kirk, at the outset, is very emotional, despite supreme intelligence. Spock shows no emotional at all, suppressing his Earth half almost completely. Each, however, is completely certain that his own method is the only way to go, and their eventual compromise, brought upon by tragic circumstances, allows the Enterprise story as we know it to fully coalesce.\nAh, you ask, if this is a reboot - hence the lack of numerals after the title - does that mean that the TV series and the movies should all be forgotten? Not so fast, my friend, not so fast! A useful little sci-fi writers' crutch known as time travel will solve everything. I'm being a little facetious, of course; this marks the third time in the eleven Star Trek films that time travel has been used, but it's not overused yet, and here it not only is a fun writers' tool but a genuinely creative way to show the past (the old films) while allowing future films to coexist.\nTo sum up: In the future, old Spock tries to prevent a supernova from destroying Romulus, but he fails; a renegade Romulan general (played here by Eric Bana) blames Spock, and both he and Spock wind up going through a black hole that takes them a century into the past. Now the Romulan is trying to destroy young Spock before he can get old and not save Romulus.\nAbrahms' pacing is stellar, pardon the pun. There's hardly any letup with the action, and when it does we get poignant, well-acted scenes of reserved anger (Spock) or pensive musings (Kirk). There's only one love scene, and it's a quickie (again pardon the pun - not intended).\nThe supporting cast was well picked, too. John Cho (Sulu), Anton Yelchin (Chekov), Karl Urban (Bones), Eric Bana (the Romulan, Nero), Ben Cross (Spock's dad), and even Winona Ryder as Spock's mother are perfect fits, eschewing scenery chewing for thoughtful, imaginative performances.\nA couple of other actors deserve special mention. Zoe Saldana plays Uhura, the beautiful communications officer on the Enterprise. Uhura has wildly different relationships with Spock and Kirk, and Saldana is well up to the task: a strong, intelligent, and relentlessly caring young woman (although, interestingly enough, not the only woman on the Enterprise's bridge). Then there's the cherubic Simon Pegg as Engineer Scotty; Scotty, unlike most of the other main characters, finds himself on the ship almost by accident, but his beaming ability saves the crew's bacon. Pegg's upbeat exuberance is catchy.\nThis isn't just another pretty-people-in-space action movie. For once, although everyone is quite young (too young?) and attractive, there's quite a bit of substance behind each character. And remember, the movie could have the scourge of familiarity working against it as well; there's always the risk that it won't meet our high expectations of how the characters should behave. Not the case here. Star Trek is gleeful fun, managing to embrace the old while opening the door to adventures anew."}

Crowe\u2019s grim, appealing performance, along with Rachel MacAdams\u2019 turn as a plucky blogger, keep the energy amped up just enough to hold interest, although ultimately the use of red herrings and a deus ex machina prevent this movie from being all that it can be.\nA thief is killed in an alley; the next day, a pretty congressman\u2019s aide is killed in a D.C. train station. Disheveled old-school newsman Cal McAffrey (Crowe) soon discovers a connection between the two, but Della Frye (MacAdams), a blogger for the paper, steals his thunder with a sensationalistic piece on the paper\u2019s website. Realizing they are pursuing different angles of the same story, McAffrey and Frye join forces, descending into the seamy underbelly of the capital city. Who had Sonia Baker killed, and why? The answers, naturally, will expose a highly intertwined network of corruption from Rep. Collins and outward.\nIn many ways, this movie is just like any other conspiracy-in-Washington thriller; there\u2019s twists and turns, some plausible and some not, and just when you think you have it all figured out, BAM, you\u2019re wrong, sorry, Charlie. That\u2019s really standard issue for this kind of thing, all set against quick DC exterior shots and to a pulse-pounding percussion soundtrack.\nAnd many of the elements of the movie seem awfully familiar. Like how all politicians are corrupt. And how there must always be some ink-stained wretch tenaciously clinging to pre-Internet values. Oh, and a tense chase-and-fight in an underground garage. And a tough-as-nails editor (here played with profane Britishness by Dame Helen Mirren).\nBut what State of Play brings to the table is a passionate, earthy Russell Crowe, who instills a real sense of justice and good old fashioned journalism, even as the intricate web inevitably ensnares him as well. Crowe\u2019s gravitas makes the movie, really; try to picture a comparative thespian lightweight, like Nicolas Cage, or a movie star, like Tom Hanks or Brad Pitt, in this role, and you can\u2019t. Crowe\u2019s Cal isn\u2019t pretty to look at, which lends the character credibility, and his single-minded pursuit of what he believes is the truth - despite his own conflict of interest. All that matters is the story, Cal McAffrey thinks, and as he steadfastly pursues the truth, he gladly uses those who would be his friends.\nCrowe is half the story, however; the story itself is the other half. While the emphasis is on the whodunit angle of the caper, under that is the role that the media plays in investigating powerful conspiracies. For as much as McAffrey wishes to believe he\u2019s just doing his job, it\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s pretending that his own involvement in the story has nothing to do with the story itself. This moral ambiguity, which seems plain in real life, helps color the movie in a way that definitely does set the movie apart from others of its ilk.\nThe supporting cast is also worth mentioning. MacAdams is very good as the green, wide-eyed rookie (\u201ddon\u2019t show those dewy cub-reporter eyes to me!\u201d bellows Mirren); Mirren herself is gritty as the chief, although I\u2019m not sure why her character has a British accent here. She couldn\u2019t do an American one? (Yes, I\u2019m aware the movie is based on a BBC series, but still.) Also showing up are Jeff Daniels as a calm fellow politico and Robin Wright Penn, in a subtle, endearing role as the congressman\u2019s wife. Oh, and Ben Affleck, but sadly he\u2019s by far the nadir of the entire film; vapid, bland, and useless, Affleck should have been replaced by someone with a personality."}

Russell Crowe is his slovenly Langley-based boss. The overly complex plot in Body of Lies is often ludicrous, with cardboard characters and a heavy-handed tone that attempts to paint a complicated situation in black-and-white terms.\nDiCaprio plays Roger Ferris, an undercover agent stationed in Jordan who also happens to be going through divorce proceedings. Crowe is Ed Hoffman, his middle-aged stay-at-home handler who talks to his agent while shepherding his kids to soccer games and the like. One is directly involved with covert operations; the other manges the operations from a distance, both physically and emotionally. Naturally, this distance causes problems in their working relationship, for how can Hoffman be able to tell Ferris how to handle things if he's too far away to get a feel for the situation? Ferris gets a lead on who might be behind some recent terrorist attacks, so he decides to become friendly with the head of Jordanian intelligence, Hani Salaam (Mark Strong), hoping to use Salaam's connections to help land his target. Ferris prefers a subtle approach when dealing with citizens of foreign lands; embrace the culture and speak the language, and the people will be more amenable to helping you. Hoffman prefers the more stereotypical American approach of rushing in, demanding, raising heck if demands aren't met. Such conflicting styles are bound to create...conflict.\nThe ultimate problem here isn't really the plot, however convoluted it is and no matter how many red herrings abound. The problem is DiCaprio himself, an actor who seems hellbent on proving he can act by being as intense as possible at all times. They're not the same thing. DiCaprio, as is his wont, plays a character who is always trying to do the right thing but makes dumb decisions along the way. Which is fine if you're a wooden action figure like Rambo, but it's pointless if you're in a heavily plotted espionage thriller. DiCaprio is a movie star, not an actor, and putting various cuts and bruises on his pretty-boy face will change the fact that he's simply not up to the heavy lifting.\nIn fact, although I'm not much of a Matt Damon fan, the truth is that Damon would have owned this role - had he not already played it, basically, in the Jason Bourne films. Which means that essentially, this is a cheap knockoff of the Bourne films themselves, except with fewer action scenes and even more high-tech gadgetry.\nHere's something to look for: Ferris's girlfriend, a nurse played very well by Golshifteh Farahani. She's pretty, of course, and Ferris - in the middle of all this running around undercover in Jordan and elsewhere in the Middle East - woos her, speaking Arabic and observing all the customs of her culture. First of all, you know as soon as they make cute eyes at each other that at some point she'll be kidnapped or killed or something, and he'll have to rescue or avenge her. Second, I found it interesting that while he's ostensibly undercover - an American in the Middle East normally sticks out a little - he doesn't seem to notice that people notice HIM interacting with her. If I'm a secret agent, the last place I'd look for a relationship is in the same exact spot where I'm trying to be a secret agent, because if the bad guys figure out I'm not on their side - always a possibility - they will also easily figure out that they can use my relationship partner against me. That would be stupid on my part, and it's unbelievably dumb on Ferris's part.\nSkip Body of Lies. Crowe is mostly wasted in a showy, slight role anyway, and DiCaprio is hammy, one dimensional, and vapid. Ridley Scott should have passed on directing this so-called political thriller and stuck to more straightforward action movies like Gladiator."}

This isn\u2019t like Aliens versus Predator, where no matter who won, we lost. OK, time\u2019s up - it\u2019s monsters. The monsters - the Missing Link, Dr. Cockroach, Ginormica, B.O.B., and Insectosaurus - are on our side, helping to defend Earth from the dastardly intentions of one Gallaxahar.\nGallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) is searching for an element called quantonium, which he believes will make him superpowerful or something. Some quantonium has landed on Earth in the form of a meteorite. A meteorite that lands on Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon) right before her wedding, causing her to grow to enormous proportions! Soon the military catches her and imprisons her with other caught monsters from over the past fifty years. And then when Gallaxhar sends a massive robot probe to Earth, a probe that is invulnerable to all attacks, only one group of mostly inhumanoids can save the day! In addition to Susan, now known as Ginormica, there\u2019s B.O.B. (Seth Rogen), a gelatinous blob; Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie) , a roach-human hybrid; The Missing Link (Will Arnett), a gill-man; and Insectosaurus, a giant - and I mean giant - grub. Bound together by a thirst for justice and fresh air, they \u201cagree\u201d to fight back against the robot probe.\nCouple of things to note here. First, although this is a PG-rated film, there\u2019s a notable use of the word \u201cboobies.\u201d As a male adult, I think it\u2019s awesome that such a word has finally made into kiddie fare, although the fact that I have no kids probably plays into that a little bit. Still, I don\u2019t think it bothered the sold-out crowd in the theater; at least there were no audible gasps. Also, the violence, because it\u2019s in 3D - yes!! - is a little more intense than for a 2D movie, since it\u2019s all in your face and such. Again, I don\u2019t think it affected the kidlets negatively.\nAnother thing to note is that Seth Rogen is a comedic genius. Fans of his live-action stuff have known that for a while, of course, and now the kids will, too, if they know he\u2019s the voice behind B.O.B., who falls for a plate of Jell-O at one point. Rogen\u2019s comic timing is hilariously on key, and he always sounds as if he\u2019s having the time of his life.\nReese Witherspoon (like Rene Zellweger in Bee Movie), as Susan, is a sweet, engaging voice actress as well. Her bemusement as she struggles with her sudden height - she uses cars as roller skates - is entertaining. There are also some slight nods to other movies; the President (played memorably by Stephen Colbert) plays the famous five notes from Close Encounters of the Third Kind before showing the Vulcan hand sign. And when the military attacks the probe, one plane has \u201cET GO HOME\u201d painted on its side.\nThis is definitely a movie that makes good use of 3D technology, and it\u2019s one that viewed in 2D would seem pedestrian. It\u2019s not quite a classic, but there are plenty of good jokes - particularly from Rogen - and it\u2019s well cast. The kids will enjoy it, and it\u2019s another in a line of enjoyable DreamWorks animated features."}

Danny Fisher must go the distance with the madman via \"rounds\" - that is, challenges - in order to save his girl. Think of it as Saw meets Die Hard, without the profanity and gore.\nNow, this is a World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) production, so I assumed that it would be kind of action heavy, something that Stallone might have done in the eighties, something with Mack-truck-sized plot holes. But it's not nearly as disappointing; it has an actual plot and throws in enough turns to keep you riveted. Sometimes it helps to have low expectations.\nFirst, here's the good stuff. There are a LOT of explosions. The movie's one big explosion, come to think of it. And of course it is, it's directed by Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger). Now, you might think that a movie that's just one big explosion would get tedious eventually, but the movie's tone hearkens back to those mindless star-powered action movies of yesteryear - that is, the Hero is more superhero than actual guy, and that gives it a little more appeal.\nThen there's Cena. For a pro wrestler, he's a very good action star. He's believable and sincere, and since he's in peak physical condition you get the impression that he actually can do the grueling feats he's attempting. His likability here saves the movie, at least to some extent. Cena's not a character I've thought of as particularly charismatic, at least not in the sense that Roddy Piper was/is charismatic, but he's a Git R Done, meat-and-potatoes kind of guy. He's no frills action, a man you could see playing a cop, like here, or a fireman, or an astronaut.\nFisher's adversary, played by Adian Gillen, is a master planner, a meticulous scholar of revenge. The impetus for his kidnapping of Fisher's girl is that Miles Jackson's girl was accidentally killed in a hit and run while they were attempting to flee Fisher a year previously (to the day, of course). Obviously, the girl's death was all Danny Fisher's fault, so Jackson escapes from prison and hatches his elaborate scheme.\nThe challenges are pretty nifty, too. In one, Fisher has two safety deposit boxes. One has a bomb in it, whereas the other one has info about the next challenge \"round.\" He has to bring the contents of one of them to a location at least 20 minutes away - in about seven minutes, or the bomb will go off. He has to figure out a) exactly where the other location is and b) which of the two boxes is the bomb. In another challenge, Fisher's action in an earlier challenge has deactivated the brakes in a trolley car, which is now building up amazing speed (for a trolley car); somehow, Fisher needs to stop the trolley. Sort of reminiscent - or derivative - of Speed, but still.\nNow some of the bad stuff. The endgame is easy to spot, certainly, but that might not be a debit for the most die-hard (pun) fan of action movies. I didn't think the actress playing Fisher's gal, Ashley Scott, was all that good - not really hot, as you want your damsel in distress to be, and not really believable, as you want any character to be. At least I wasn't openly rooting for her to perish.\n12 Rounds reminds me of that surge of action films that came out post-Die Hard. You know, Die Hard on a plane, Die Hard on a boat, and so on. It's derivative of just about any action movie you can think of, really, with some of the dialog bordering on the highly laughable. But for me, I was able to ignore those obvious flaws and concentrate on the intrepid heroism of John Cena, just as the producers intended me to do. So yes, it's manipulative fluff that will appeal to only a small audience.\n**1/2"}

Po's lack of ability - not to mention a recognizable waistline - runs counter to all that Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) teaches, and it doesn't ingratiate him with his idols, the Furious Five, either. This fast-paced comedy adventure is heavier on actual culture than pop-culture references, which is forever to its credit, and the game work by Black and Hoffman aid the rather generic storyline (fat boy must overcome odds to beat skilled ninja) immeasurably.\nThere really is plenty to like about this movie. Let's start with the casting. Jack Black is a formidable, engaging comic personality to begin with, and he infuses Po with such exuberant naivet\u00e9 and vulnerability that he's just like one of us, if we too were slovenly, belching pandas. Hoffman is also spot on as the wizened and wise Master Shifu, a red panda (although with far less red fur than you'd think), stereotypically tough on his charges but with a heart of gold. Somewhere in there, anyway. Maybe it's just a heart of emerald, or something.\nAside from those two marquee names, Ian McShane (of Deadwood) is the nefarious Tai Lung, a former pupil of Shifu who has just broken out of prison, stronger than ever and with revenge on his mind. Considering he's voicing a creature in a PG-rated animated film, McShane's Tai Lung is full of menace and hatred, a vile enemy who's apt to scare the youngest audience members. But I'm sure the adults can handle his intensity, if they look away every now and again.\nPo has idolized the Furious Five all his life and desperately wants to see who will be selected by Master Oogway, Shifu's master, as the Dragon Warrior. Through an awesomely funny yet contrived circumstances, Po is chosen. \"There are no accidents,\" intones Oogway mystically. Being chosen as the Dragon Warrior doesn't gain Po any favors with Shifu's current students, the famed Furious Five - Crane (David Cross), Viper (Lucy Liu), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Monkey (Jackie Chan), and Tigress (Angelina Jolie), who thought that one of them would be The Chosen One (tm). And so Po must prove himself to the other students and to his master, who just wants him to go away.\nOne debit is that the supporting cast seems to be there for their names. Liu, Chan, Rogen, and Cross, four excellent talents, barely get any lines at all, and although Jolie gets a little more, uh, voice time, she doesn't really bring anything extra to the table. Stunt casting, is how I feel about it. Stunt casting.\nEven so, I laughed my ass off, despite the wholesome moral of even the littlest person making a difference or something. The point is that Black made me believe in Po. When he's jumping up the side of a cliff to get a sacred scroll, so was I. When Po is eating Master Shifu out of house and home, so was I. And when Po believed in himself, so did I. This movie was full of moments that make me remember exactly why I watch movies in the first place: to laugh and to believe."}

Was his murder somehow connected to the feared imminent nuclear holocaust between the United States and Russia? Someone seems to want the former do-gooders out of the way in this thrilling, one-of-a-kind, jaded look at superheroes that turns conventional comic-book wisdom on its head.\nIt's an alternate 1985. Richard Nixon has been elected to a fifth presidential term. But the USSR is encroaching on Afghanistan, and the US isn't taking too kindly to it. Enter the smartest man in the world, Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode), formerly known as superhero Ozymandias, who is working with the ethereal Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), a physicist who has achieved immortality and near-omniscience owing to a long-ago lab mishap. With Dr. Manhattan's help, Adrian hopes to dissolve the tension between the two superpowers.\nBut that's not the only conflict, not by a long shot. Since the characters here are unfamiliar to most audiences, there's plenty of backstory, seamlessly edited into the main story as important details that inform the characters. (For one thing, we get to see the rather graphic - more on that later - origin of Dr. Manhattan.) The superheroes have conflict within their own group, which has gone its separate ways - with different goals and outlooks. Not only that, but the world at large isn't entirely on the side of masked avengers, labeling them as vigilantes. By the present, most of them have ditched their costumes for traditional lives; some tinker with their gadgets in their basements, in hiding, and some merely blend into society.\nHere's who's left in 1985, in addition to Ozymandias (who's revealed his true identity to the world) and Dr. Manhattan: Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman), and The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Others have gone insane or been murdered themselves in years past; all suffer as everyday humans now.\nSo how does Watchmen skewer comic-book tropes? Well, they're not always good, you see. Some are, but some maliciously kill, albeit for the greater good. Some take delight in the suffering of man if that man is, say, a child killer. That sort of thing. The truth is, no one here is perfect, not even the superheroes. Another difference is the high level of violence in the movie. This isn't a comic-book movie where the bad guys fall down when they get slapped, no sir. No, the heroes beat the stuffing out of them, with blood, entrails, and the like splattering all over the place. Limbs are dislodged, brains are exposed. It's wildly violent, much like director Zack Snyder's last film, 300, but without the detached, this-can't-be-real tone. This isn't a movie in which the bad guys are brought in for questioning or sent to prison to think about what they've done. This is a movie in which the bad guys are annihilated, period.\nIn case you're still contemplating taking the kiddies to see this superhero fare, here's another caveat: there's nudity. No, it's not Malin Akerman (although you do get a glimpse), it's the blue-hued Dr. Manhattan himself. Sometimes he's in a thong, but often he's just letting it all dangle there. Funny thing is, it's not really all that shocking. If it'd been one of the humans, perhaps, but Dr. Manhattan is more humanoid than human at this point.\nAt 160 minutes, the action really doesn't let up. But that's nothing - most movies are fast paced now. This one has a plot that can keep up with the action. In fact, the intricacies of the plot are delicious to unwrap; this was not a movie - superhero or not - where you can predict the end without just taking a wild stab.\nI can't understate how tremendous an achievement this movie is. If we're all lucky, this will open the door for more adult comic-book films. The good guys don't always have to be about justice and truth and all that junk, and the bad guys can sometimes get what's really coming to them. I do want to point out that among the outstanding cast, Jackie Earle Haley as the haunted, masked Rorschach is tremendous. Wilson, who appeared with Haley in Little Children a few years back, is also dweebishly strong as the aging Nite Owl II."}

Although it's completely computer animated, the movie recalls such stop-motion-animation fare as The Nightmare before Christmas and the recent Coraline, not to mention the old Universal monster classics, whose old clich\u00e9s get tweaked a few times.\nIgor (it's both his name and his profession) works for Dr. Glickenstein (John Cleese), who's desperately trying to make an evil invention to enter into the Evil Scientists Fair. See, King Malbert (Jay Leno) believes that the town can prosper only through these evil inventions, what with the farming community destroyed by climate change. Meanwhile, Igor - our Igor - is much smarter than he lets on, as Igors are stereotypically supposed to be dumb, slurring oafs good only for fetching things and pulling switches. Igor, in fact, has already made two inventions - a snide, suicidal-yet-immortal rabbit (Steve Buscemi), and a dumb robot with a brain (Sean Hayes).\nCircumstances lead Igor to try to make his own evil entry - the creation of life itself, something the real evil scientists have never been able to accomplish. The result: Eva, a giant, giant, giantess who's... well, not evil. This is because her Evil Bone must be activated, see; to do so, Igor even takes her to get brainwashed, but instead of horror images Eva somehow watches an episode of Inside the Actor's Studio with James Lipton, so when she emerges she's a struggling actress who's on her way to a big audition.\nPersonally, I found this movie a whole lot of fun, probably because a) I love the old monster movies that are just skewered here and b) I love animated movies, too. John Cusack, one of my all-time favorites (I've seen more than thirty of his films) is great as the not-quite-evil lab assistant, and the animation is top notch, with wonderfully realized backgrounds that recall those old monster movies quite well. Steve Buscemi is an absolute hoot as Scamper, easily stealing every scene he's in - he gets all the great lines, but it's Buscemi's comic timing that make them come alive. So to speak. There's also a contextually perfect soundtrack, including a bouncy tune by Louis Prima called \"The Bigger the Figure.\" Molly Shannon, who voices Eva, also delivers a fun, appealing performance."}

Even though it steeps itself in profane drug humor, it has several hysterical moments that, when viewed through a prism of credulity, will have you rolling on the floor with mirth.\nFirst off, this is a buddy film. Guys become friends, one guy does something bad to the other guy, they go their separate ways, they get back together, they save the day. This kind of plot is something you see in most other Judd Apatow films (he produced), not to mention most Kevin Smith films. But certainly we're not tuning in for meaningful, deep dialog between two stoners, are we? No, we're here for the gags and the undeniable chemistry between James Franco and Seth Rogen (who co-wrote the movie).\nI think it's safe to say that if you've liked previous Apatow movies - The 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up - and/or previous Rogen-written movies - Superbad - you'll appreciate Pineapple Express all the more. Seems to me that Apatow is trying to restore a long-lost genre, that of the R-rated drug comedy; aside from the American Pie films, most comedies are generic, lame PG-13 films that don't even nudge the envelope. With Apatow and his extended crew, we don't have to sit through another faceless farce if we don't want to.\nHere's the threadbare plot. Dale Denton (Rogen) is a process server who inadvertently witnesses a murder while outside the home of an oily bad guy (played well by Gary Cole). In his haste to get the bejeezus out of there, Dale hits two cars, one of which belongs to a cop in on the murder. And now Dale has bad guys on his tail. He rushes to the closest compadre he has - Saul Silver (Franco), his dope dealer. This is not a movie, you might guess, where you'll hear moralizing about how drugs are bad, mmkay? Watch this enough times and you'll think pot's the greatest thing since Oreos. Anyway, that's how the shenanigans begin, as both Dale and Saul find themselves on the run.\nAs with most movies, though, this one's probably better appreciated while blitzed out of one's mind. You know how in olden days people would drop acid and then go see 2001: A Space Odyssey? It's sort of like that. Without chemical enhancement, the jokes are hit or miss (but when they hit, they pack a wallop); with it, you'd be giggling through the credits.\nBut regardless, it's not the jokes themselves that make this a fun movie to watch, it's the appeal that Franco and Rogen bring to the screen, not only individually but also as a frantic comic team. In fact, \"frantic\" describes the film rather well, as Things Happen to our duo as if shot from a Gatling gun. Rushing from absurd situation to absurder situation is part of what makes something funny, after all, and as long as you don't expect actual logic or adherence to the laws of physics, you'll find this a scream.\nPineapple Express is, in fact, senseless hilarity, the very textbook example of a dumb comedy that defiantly wraps itself in wacky banter and incorrigible characters."}

Paul Rudd stars as a schlub who proposes to his fianc\u00e9 (Rashida Jones) and then spends half the movie trying to find some guy, any guy, to be his best man, since he\u2019s lacking in buds.\nAlong the way, he finds his new best friend ever in the person of Sydney Fife (Jason Segal), a wacky truth-telling soulmate who slowly begins to pry the hapless Pete away from his betrothed. Hilarity doesn\u2019t quite ensue as much wander around aimlessly and flop down on a beanbag chair.\nPete\u2019s a nice guy who has no guy friends at all. (I can sort of relate.) He\u2019s always had girl friends, as opposed to girlfriends. Oh, let\u2019s just call them gal pals. When Zooey asks him who he\u2019s going to have as his best man, though, he\u2019s at a loss. His dad? Nah, his dad\u2019s best friends with Pete\u2019s younger brother (Andy Samberg). Guys at work? Nah, they\u2019re a bunch of go-getting, artificially tanned prima donnas. What about his fencing club? Nah, he doesn\u2019t hang with them. So instead, on the advice of his brother, Pete goes on a series of \u201cman dates\u201d to find his special bro. One of these in particular, played by Thomas Lennon, has a surprise of his own.\nBut sort of by accident, he runs into Sydney, a dude who\u2019s all that. Sydney listens and likes to hang with Pete. It\u2019s sort of like courting a new girlfriend, really. And all of a sudden, Pete\u2019s doing less wedding planning and more gallivanting, which is a word I picked up reading Hardy Boys mysteries. Now he\u2019s going to Rush concerts and jamming on the bass.\nFor the most part, Rudd nails the part of the guy who\u2019s just too awkward to fit in with the other guys. But he\u2019s a little too awkward. One of the running jokes in the film is that Pete just can\u2019t get the hang of new-fangled slang. Like when Syd calls him \u201cPistol\u201d after Pete Maravich, and Pete can\u2019t come up with anything that\u2019s not completely unfunny. Not even funny in the amusingly cute and dorky way. He\u2019s a classic dweeb, and yet here he is a realtor. (One of his clients, in another amusing gag, is Lou Ferrigno.) Because Pete\u2019s so incredibly awkward, he\u2019s a little hard to root for. If you\u2019re the popular kind (or were back in the day), you feel a little guilty, laughing at Pete\u2019s inadequacies. And if you\u2019re the unpopular kind, you cringe a little, knowing perhaps it\u2019s a bit too dead-on of a portrayal.\nI also found it a bit difficult to tell where Sydney was coming from. Was he a good guy after all? Could this be a movie where the good guy turns out to be bad but it\u2019s just a woeful misunderstanding? His motives were unclear until the end, when it was too late for me to care. He\u2019s also a little annoying (he has some jumbly logic for not cleaning up after his dog, for instance) and creepy.\nThere are jokes here, mostly at Pete\u2019s expense, and I understand that the movie wanted to be sensitive and meaningful while still being crude and raunchy, but it never found a middle ground to enjoy the best of both worlds. The laughs were good when they were there, but they were so scattershot that they felt like shooting icicles from a handgun. OK, bad simile, but you get the drift."}

And then things get weird in director Henry Selick\u2019s highly imaginative fantasy, filmed in dazzling 3D stop animation.\nThere\u2019s so much to like about this movie, but if you weren\u2019t a fan of The Nightmare before Christmas (also directed by Selick), you may as well stop reading: this is not the movie for you.\nThere are two other tenants in the apartment house: an elderly British couple, stars of the stage (played by Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French of Absolutely Fabulous) and a Russian acrobat who\u2019s all limbs and belly (played by Ian McShane of Deadwood). All the tenants are oddballs who, one would think, would provide the bored Coraline with plenty of stimulation, but they\u2019re a bit self absorbed - the actresses constantly competing with each other for any purpose, and the acrobat constantly working on his act with trained mice.\nWhen Coraline stumbles upon a locked crawlspace door, she\u2019s immediately intrigued, but unlocking it reveals only a brick wall. But then that night she\u2019s awakened by a mouse under her bed who leads her back to the door, which, when she opens it, now shows a tenuous pathway to another, far-off door. Being the curious little girl she is, Coraline goes through the door, emerging in an exact replica of her own kitchen. Except different. The mother in this room is cooking, for one thing, which her real mother never does. And when the mother turns to greet Coraline, there\u2019s another, even greater difference: she wears two black buttons for eyes. Gasp! Seems that this new world Coraline\u2019s discovered is perfect in every way, with wonderful, caring parents who dote on her every whimsy. Not only can her mom cook, she cooks everything Coraline wants. And her dad is a musician - the piano plays him! Oh, it\u2019s madness, I tell you, sheer madness. Then there\u2019s outside! In the real world, it\u2019s a desolate yard, unencumbered by plant life (the irony here is that Coraline\u2019s parents are gardening writers), but here there\u2019s a magnificent display, a visual cacophony of light and flowers and birds and bees. It\u2019s astoundingly rendered in stop-motion animation, and it\u2019s even more wondrous in three dimensions.\nBut things aren\u2019t as they seem. The stark beauty of this other world and the kindness of the Other Mother are mere props in a greater play. The question posed is this: Will Coraline decide to stay in her new world, even if she must sacrifice to do so? Beyond the impressive cinematography (by Pete Kozachik, who was nominated for The Nightmare before Christmas), there\u2019s also excellent voice work offered by Dakota Fanning as Coraline as well as Teri Hatcher (as Mother and Other Mother) and John Hodgeman (the IBM guy in those currently ubiquitous Apple ads). Fanning in particular was a good choice as the hurting, neglected Coraline.\nCoraline is brilliantly conceived and stupendously executed. It has all the mystery and show-stopping magnetism of The Nightmare before Christmas, and it has even more heart. Know why? Because more so than Nightmare, this is a tale about love and redemption; you root for Coraline not only because she\u2019s a psychologically lost girl but also because her antagonist is so hissably awful. The villain here is really a symbol for the feeling all kids have at some point of not being wanted or appreciated; Coraline must slay that dragon to survive."}

It has a fine cast, but it often feels like a numbing video game, complete with quick cuts and slowed-down CGI effects. Its plot is often befuddling, as if it was scrawled by a hyperactive spider monkey who'd just had ten vials of crack explode in his stomach.\nFirst up, the Incredible Hulk part - seems the ever-popular clandestine government agency is out to find people who have special powers (that'd be the X Men part). Powers, it should be noted, that the government itself gave to the people in the first place in an attempt to weaponize them. What sort of powers, you ask? Well, some can move objects with their minds. Some can push thoughts onto others. Some can see the future. Some can see an object's past through smell. Some can alter the shape of things for brief periods of time, some can heal, and some can wipe memories. So you can see why the always-nefarious government would want to get ahold of these powers.\nCassie Holmes (Dakota Fanning) is a Watcher, constantly drawing pictures of what she sees happening. Her mom is a prisoner of the Division, which is trying to track down another girl who's escaped from their clutches, the only person to survive injection of a new superdrug designed to enhance their abilities. Cassie believes that if she finds the girl and the hypodermic needle she's stolen, she'll be able to free her mother. She turns to Nick Gant (Chris Evans of Fantastic Four), a Mover on the run. In fact, everyone's on the run from the Division - in China, no less, a good setting for this kind of thing, what with a billion people living there. Head of the Division task force out to get this mysterious girl is Henry Carver (two-time Oscar nominee Djimon Hounsou, playing a bad guy for once), who's naturally extremely endowed himself with paranormal abilities.\nAnd all of this sounds sort of intriguing, if somewhat predictable - you know that the evil government agency has nothing but malevolent intentions with those who have these cursed abilities, but the plot is convoluted, needlessly complicated by endless double crosses and feints. To compensate for the opaque storyline, we get choppy edits and fast camera-work. The special effects seem to have been lifted right out of an old copy of Mortal Kombat; were I not in a crowded theater, I'd have shouted \"Finish him!\" a few times. Sometimes these effects are slowed down; you know, to show you how awesomely powerful the impact must be. Ouch, sucks to be him, right? Chris Evans is rather generic as the hero guy; one wonders what would have happened if an actor with some charisma were in the lead. Dakota Fanning, on the other hand, seems to have gotten past her awkward years on screen. She's no longer the cute little moppet, but she's not the listless, sullen preteen of War of the Worlds. Her Cassie is precocious, dressing a little like a streetwalker, maybe Madonna circa 1985, but she lends gravitas to the role that you wouldn't think possible from such a youngster. She's outstanding as the vulnerable, but tough, Watcher.\nIn the end, it's Fanning's work plus some interesting fight scenes that save this from being a complete disaster. The dumb script (cmon, people who can kill by shouting?) is overcome by only the loud, ceaseless soundtrack full of bad-music-video songs. Push isn't nearly intriguing enough to warrant a theater ticket."}

As a result, its identity shatters into the proverbial million little pieces, each less interesting than the last.\nMichael Berg (David Kross) is 15 and on the verge of falling under two spells: first, scarlet fever, from which he recovers in a few months, and then Hanna (Winslet), the older woman who helps him when he becomes ill. It is from this latter spell, though, that Michael never recovers; he feels the impact of their short, summer affair until the end of the movie (forty years later).\nAs romances go, it\u2019s pretty sweet for the teen: he gets to sleep with a sexy older woman who desires only one thing (other than his sinewy body, of course): for him to read to her whatever trips his fancy. It\u2019s a symbiotic relationship; he\u2019s happy to have found a kindred spirit and ecstatic - pardon the term - to find an outlet for his hormones. She, on the other hand, is happy for his company and to hear him recite works of classic literature.\nBut as all affairs do, theirs ends abruptly, with nary an explanation, and that\u2019s the last young Michael sees of Hanna, until he\u2019s in law school years later, and as a field trip he\u2019s in the very courtroom where a group of female, ex-Nazi guards is being charged with war crimes. Lo and behold, one of the guards is Hanna! The story is related in flashback through the memories of the adult Michael, played by Ralph Fiennes. Fiennes is a fine (ha) actor, of course, but it seems he\u2019s always stuck with these repressed, completely controlled roles. Distant, Michael\u2019s called in the movie, an emotional cipher. Michael attempts, for decades, to come to grips with two dilemmas: why did Hanna leave him, and is her alleged Nazi past true? For me, I didn\u2019t much care about his first dilemma; of course she left him, because she\u2019s like twice his age and he was the clingy, controlling type. I was more concerned with the latter dilemma, because the trailer leads you to believe there\u2019s some dispute about that. But this isn\u2019t a courtroom drama. It\u2019s more of a romance melodrama with serious undertones about the choices we make and the responsibility we marshal. The suggestion is made in the movie that the German people are looking for someone on whom to pin the blame of the Holocaust, and who better than guards following orders? Really, the film has just one thing going for it, although it\u2019s a doozy: Kate Winslet, who electrifies the screen even when she\u2019s not on it. Her vulnerable, conflicted Hanna is nurturing and distant, just as Michael would turn out; we can only guess at her true feelings, but Winslet is so talented that with a mere glance she can turn our perceptions on edge. She is this film, inside and out, and the fact that she also gets naked doesn\u2019t hurt matters.\nThe Reader perhaps overreached its goals, whatever they may be. It admirably tries to give us a main character who is not noble and good of heart in all things, but it fails to give us a solid reason to care about the proceedings other than as if we were being read a tale set in a faraway land in a distant time."}

Walt Kowalski, having recently buried his wife, now lives alone in an immaculate house with his yellow Lab, alone to carry the sins of his past and to meticulously tend to his two loves, his yard and his mint-condition 1972 Ford Gran Torino.\nEastwood takes great care in showing us how irascible Walt is. He constantly spits tobacco juice. He shuns the church and its eager-beaver pastor. He wants merely to be left alone, albeit with a half-grimace, half-sneer on his face at all times, as if he's just eaten something disagreeable. Yes, hardly a more cuddly, welcoming figure you'll never see.\nShortly after the Lor family moves in next door, raising Walt's hackles, trouble begins; an Asian gang harasses the only man in the family, teenaged Thao, and his older sister, Su, trying to recruit the former. As an initiation rite, the gang forces Thao to steal Walt's prized car, but he fails in the process, thus angering both the gang and Walt, who catches him. But later, when the gang tries to grab Thao forcibly in front of his home, Walt chases them off with a shotgun, earning the gratitude of the neighborhood and the undying wrath of the gang. (This is the scene in the trailer where Eastwood famously tells the gangbangers to get off his lawn.) Such a display of rebellion would never sit well for a die-hard gang member, so certainly the situation escalates. I won't ruin the plot for you any further than to tell you that things do get out of hand. Armed with big guns, little guns, and a perpetual sneer, Kowalski isn't a mere carbon copy of Charles Bronson in Death Wish; he realizes his limitations (not to mention his mortality), that he's not some kind of hero in any sense - even though the rest of the neighborhood believes him to be and showers him with gifts.\nEastwood is at his crunchiest and most crotchety here; it's as if he had a severe case of heartburn for two hours and didn't want to tell anyone directly. Kowalski never smiles; he grimaces and grits his teeth, but he's never happy, sort of emblematic of the character's entire life. As the local priest notes, Walt knows a lot about death (having killed men in Korea) but almost nothing about life. No, this isn't a movie about a bad man's eternal salvation, it's more about a man doing what a man's gotta do. And that includes not only saving the family from the thugs on occasion but taking Thao under his wing and teaching him how to be a man.\nGran Torino is overtly racist, but it skirts the line of offensiveness through the use of hyperbole. Walt Kowalski uses every ethnic slur in the book (except, notably, the n word), sometimes to great comic effect. Even when he's insulting everyone, we don't feel he's insulting us personally, so we're not as aggrieved by his vocabulary choices. Eastwood is convincing as the seething rage machine, and he has a fine supporting cast. The movie is a little longer than one would hope (that is, it ended a bit longer than I thought it should), but it's an effective and highly evocative story of a man's quest for inner peace."}

The Mummy: The Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, is silly, bloated nonsense that's helped in no small amount by excellent special effects, allowing it to (barely) overcome dull characters and an illogical plot.\nThe Mummy movies are essentially Indiana Jones wannabes, but the reason they've succeeded to this point is that their plots, although simplistic, made a lick of a sense, and the lead characters were engaging. It's not always the case in this third movie in the series; rather than a storyline driving the effects, it's the other way around, and it's noticeable. That, added to the lack of chemistry between Brendan Fraser (playing Rick O'Connell) and Maria Bello (playing Evelyn O'Connell) makes this more of a miss than a hit.\nActually, calling it a lack of chemistry isn't entirely fair. Fraser and Bello, replacing Rachel Weisz are okay together, but Bello isn't entirely believable. The transition from Weisz to Bello just isn't seamless; when you look at Evelyn you can't help but notice she's not Rachel Weisz. Bello's Evelyn seems, at times, to be more simpering and matronal than Weisz's ever was, but part of that has to do with the progression of the lead characters: they met in the first movie and had a kid for the second movie, and now their intraconflict has to do with their now-grown (!) son, and it's a weak conflict.\nAnd that's the second problem with the movie. Apparently, the producers felt that Rick and Evvie shouldn't be toting a tot around the world - as they did in the second movie - so they moved the kid's age up to early twenties instead. Trouble is, the last movie was only seven years ago, when little Alex was in single digits. Suddenly, he's all grown up. Fraser looks the same, though, making it all a tad incongruous.\nThe plot? Oh, something about an evil Chinese emperor-mummy being raised so he can restore China to its rightful throne of the most awesomest country in the universe, or something. Seems this emperor (played by Jet Li), seeking immortality, was instead cursed by a double-crossed witch (played by Michelle Yeoh), turning him and his entire army into terra cotta. (The terra-cotta-warriors part is based on the real-life Qin Dynasty, believe it or not.) Emperor gets raised, the O'Connells are contrivably involved, and mayhem occurs.\nHighlights include the sweeping cinematography (by Simon Duggan), typical of the Mummy films, and the work of the Asian actresses - Yeoh as the immortal witch and Isabella Leong as her immortal daughter, who naturally falls for Alex O'Connell (played by Aussie Luke Ford). And the action sequences are fun to watch, particularly the climactic standoff at the temple at Shangri-La.\nBut overall, this feels like unmemorable and wasted time. If this had made money (it didn't quite recoup its $145 million price tag), the idea was that Alex would have taken over the series, since star Fraser's three-film commitment is complete. Truth is, while Fraser's okay in the lead, he doesn't bring anything extra to the table - he's just a generic action guy. In fact, he's a generic action guy who makes a lot of these exact movies, like Journey to the Center of the Earth, as if it were some calculated studio plan to make him into an A-lister who can open action movies, to use industry parlance."}

I never read the comic books, didn\u2019t know anything about Hellboy, didn\u2019t know where he was from, what he was, anything, and the movie addressed all that for me. But after the backstory\u2019s been told, the audience craves something exciting, a tale that makes sense and doesn\u2019t run counter to what they know about the characters.\nIn Hellboy 2, the Bureau gets a new, er, bureaucrat to replace Dr. Broom (John Hurt, seen in a flashback). Johann Krauss is a disembodied ectoplasmic spirit housed in a diving apparatus. (No, really.) He\u2019s German, so that means he\u2019s rigid and regimental and does things By the Book. I wonder how Hellboy will react to this? The dynamics of the Bureau\u2019s top agents are as muddled as ever. Hellboy (Ron Perlman) and Liz (Selma Blair) are together, but kind of snapping at each other, as if they were a married couple, or something. He\u2019s a lazy slob, she\u2019s a nag, etc. Luckily, Blair and Perlman are both aces here, and they work very well together. Then there\u2019s Abe Sapien, the alien who sounds an awful lot like C-3PO; he\u2019s the brains to Hellboy\u2019s brawn. So really the team is functionally dysfunctional, or something.\nThe antagonist here is an exiled evil prince who\u2019s trying to revive the Golden Army, a large group of robot monsters that simply cannot be stopped. All he needs is all three parts of an ancient crown, and the world will be his! AHAHAHAHAHAA. The prince looks a lot like Lucius Malfoy, but he\u2019s got the mad ninja skills of a Jackie Chan, so he\u2019s a formidable opponent. He\u2019s also helped by a giant golem, which means we\u2019re sure to see at least two epic battles between Hellboy and Some Bad Guy, causing a boatload of damage to New York City. Along the way, the Bureau\u2019s outed, much to Krauss\u2019s chagrin and to Hellboy\u2019s delight. Tough to be a covert paranormal investigative unit when your pictures are all over the news.\nPerlman is an excellent Hellboy - sarcastic, cigar-chomping, fun-loving, and full of crap. So much so, in fact, that you sometimes forget he\u2019s a giant red\u2026 thing. But look at him! He\u2019s covered in makeup and prosthetics, and yet it\u2019s Hellboy\u2019s acerbic, witty, pained personality that comes through. That there is some fine acting.\nGuillermo del Toro\u2019s stylish (as always) comic-book movie gets high marks for flash and substance, allowing multilayered, unorthodox characters to seem as regular as the neighborhood mailman, save for the superpowers and massive strength and intelligence. Hellboy 2 is an elegant, ravenous blend of humor, horror, and deadbolt action, a worthy successor to the original."}

But naturally, they can\u2019t stay in London for long, so soon they find themselves back in Narnia. Only it\u2019s not quite the Narnia they remember (back when they were kings and queens there), because Narnia time moves quite a bit faster than London time - it\u2019s now 1300 years after the kids were last there, although only one year has passed for them personally. They soon find themselves in a conflict between the native Narnians (i.e., talking animals, trees, centaurs, and so on) and the human Telmarines. The Pevensies decide to help the ousted Prince Caspian reclaim his rightful throne, thus allowing the Narnian creatures to live happily ever after.\nThe film has many rousing action scenes, but not so many that you feel like you\u2019re in a whirlwind of CGI and arrows and blades, as with some fantasy movies. Director Andrew Adamson, who directed the first LWW film (as well as all three Shrek movies) keeps the film moving, allowing us to catch our breath occasionally - but not much more. Filmed in part in New Zealand, the grand, sweeping battle scenes feel like they\u2019re straight out Braveheart.\nWe get some character development as well, as the kids mature believably from start to finish, just as they did in the first one. The boys can sometimes be snotty brats, but I suppose that\u2019s more of a British attitude than just a childish one; the girls, conversely, are resolute and wise. Particularly wonderful is Anna Popplewell as Susan Pevensie, the archer with a heart of gold. Popplewell makes a commanding, compassionate queen, and she\u2019s so gutsy and determined in her performance that every line she delivers will send shivers down your spine.\nPerhaps the greatest accomplishment of this followup, though, is that the movie is a success even though the most prominent character in the books is absent for 95% of the film. That would be Aslan the lion, voiced by the inimitable Liam Neeson. Aslan, the symbol for Christ, showed up in the nick of time in the first movie to help save the day, but here he\u2019s just not around. Why hath he forsaken the Pevensies? There are some pretty intense battle scenes (although largely bloodless), despite the PG rating, so you may need to be careful with the littlest ones. But it\u2019s a Disney movie, so don\u2019t expect anything nightmare inducing. Other than talking animals, of course"}

Although most of the accents seem inauthentic anyway, Cruise's dull, toneless American dialect is about as sincere as Kevin Costner's legendary Robin Hood accent, without the sweeping sense of purpose. In the end, the movie is largely forgettable; given the large amount of negative publicity surrounding it and its star, this is faint praise indeed.\nColonel von Stauffenberg (Cruise) is a disillusioned German officer during World War II who decides that he and he alone must thwart the Fuhrer and save Germany from itself. He quickly discovers, though, that he's not exactly alone in that attitude, as various fellow officers (played by such luminaries as Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, and Terence Stamp) have been trying to take Hitler out for some time. All they need is a good plan and a good organizer.\nThe trouble, Stauffenberg quickly realizes, isn't the assassination itself but rather the aftermath. You can't just kill Hitler and waltz in with a new chancellor, since he does have plenty of supporters. So Staffenberg decides to co-opt an existing plan, called Valkryie, and adopt it for his own purposes. Valkyrie is intended to be the contingency plan should the Allies break through to Berlin, but Stauffenberg (rather easily) rewrites it so that one set of Germans is blamed for the assassination of Der Fuhrer, thus allowing them to be imprisoned by another set of Germans. Quite crafty.\nBut as any casual student of world affairs in the twentieth century can attest, this isn't how thins panned out. As we all know, Hitler eventually committed suicide in his bunker in 1945, as the war was nearing its conclusion. So obviously the Stauffenberg plan was an abject failure, which sort of removes a lot of suspense. But director Bryan Singer still manages to make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up, particularly during the explosion that ostensibly kills Hitler (and his cabinet); you know it's coming, but it arrives so suddenly and so organically, without any good-guy slow-motion theatrics, that it's very jarring and effective.\nIn addition, Singer pays less attention to What This All Means to the world (and Germany in particular) and concentrates instead on the psychological makeup of the conspirators, particularly the reticent General Olbricht (Nighy) and the decisive Stauffenberg. What happens to influence their plan? What happens that they hadn't counted on at all? Most importantly, what happens when the plan ultimately fails? So I have to give Singer a lot of credit here, building up some suspense when the outcome is already knowable to everyone.\nBut the overall probably, as usual, is Cruise himself: he's simply not credible in the role of a long-serving German military officer. Cruise always seems to feel that since he's such a Great Actor, he can simply slap on some accessory - in this case, an eyepatch - and he's immediately transformed into that character. Not the same guy, Stauffenberg and Cruise! Not the same guy at all! The fact is, though, that the eyepatch has more personality; Cruise is neither serious enough nor solid enough in the role for you to believe he's anything other than Tom Cruise, Movie Guy. He even rolls through his standard two or three expressions, and when that's done, he's done.\nCast with another Stauffenberg, Valkryie might have soared a bit higher, but Cruise's flawed performance is more reminiscent of an albatross than an eagle."}
< {"rating": "9", "date": "30 December 2008", "title_id": "tt0421715", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "Smash masterpiece", "content": "At nearly three hours, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button can be a little difficult to get through, considering there are hardly any explosions and not a hobbit in sight. It\u2019s the kind of movie you have to prepare yourself for mentally, to sort of gird yourself against the slow - and I mean slow - scenes as the norm, not the exception. But if you are willing to invest the time and to commit to the film as a whole, the experience is enriching, beautiful, touching, and fascinating, in large part because of two stellar lead performances, by Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett.Based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story, the movie concerns the life of the title character, who was born with what\u2019s judiciously called in the movie a reverse-aging disease; that is, he\u2019s born with the physical characteristics of an old man, and as time passes he looks younger and younger. You can just imagine the wacky shenanigans that commence! But this isn\u2019t a comedy. It\u2019s a deeply affecting, layered movie about not only the aging process itself - who among us hasn\u2019t fantasized about being younger than we are now - but also the effect we have on the people around us, even peripherally. It\u2019s also about loss and hope and death and unfettered romance. So yeah, it\u2019s kind of a chick flick.\nOh, but what a chick flick! I have to say that even though this is the longest non-action movie I\u2019ve ever seen, it\u2019s very compelling. Director David Fincher - who worked with Pitt on Seven and Fight Club - had a dilemma right from the get-go: How do you tell a story when everyone knows how it ends? Sure, this isn\u2019t based on a true-life event or anything, but the basic premise tells you everything: Man is born old, dies as a baby. So you know he eventually dies. How does the director get from A to B without seeing his audience doze off? By operating within the framework of the quirky premise itself. Everything you or I experiences in life, we experience as a linear process: A, then B, then C, and so on. Benjamin Button goes from Z to Y to X, and so on, but there are greater implications - and complications - than simply doing everything in reverse. For one thing, Benjamin has the unique problem of watching people he loves grow old and die while he gets younger. For another, he has to deal with people believing he\u2019s an infirm old man when he\u2019s a naive preteen.\nAt the heart of the story, though, is the loves of Benjamin, particularly a troika of women: his adoptive mother Queenie, played by Taraji P. Henson; Elizabeth, the wife of a high-ranking Briton in Russia, played by the elegant Tilda Swinton; and Daisy, the granddaughter of one of the women residing in the old-folks home where Benjamin was raised, played by Elle Fanning as a girl and Blanchett as a grownup. Benjamin experiences all of his love in a way that none of us ever has or ever could. He looks experienced, but he\u2019s not, and easing into adulthood as the rest of us might isn\u2019t quite on the menu. It\u2019d be baffling enough to do things sort of out of order, but since Benjamin has no frame of reference, he\u2019s not sure what\u2019s right and what\u2019s not so right.\nThere are many people out there who solemnly swear that Brad Pitt just plain stinks as an actor, that he basically plays the same grinning doofus in every movie. I don\u2019t think this has been the case for a long time, perhaps back as far as Thelma and Louise, as Pitt\u2019s taken on more and more tough, detailed roles. Don\u2019t believe me? Check out Babel, for which he should have been nominated for an Oscar. Or Seven Years in Tibet, or Fight Club, or the Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. The man isn\u2019t just a pretty boy, and I think it\u2019s sort of prejudicial to label him as such when he\u2019s clearly better than that.\nCate Blanchett, by positive comparison, completely nails the role of Daisy. Blanchett is an attractive woman, but she\u2019s never been called the sexiest woman alive, or some such nonsense. Her exuberance, her dedication to her craft, and her willingness to play unglamorous roles make her arguably the greatest actress of her generation. She\u2019s exquisitely wonderful here, playing a complex character who ages somewhat gracefully but always, always believably. Her anguish at seeing her true love look better and better while she (she feels) looks worse and worse is compounded by her dread at knowing what lies at the end of the path, for while she\u2019ll probably die just as millions others before her have, at a ripe old age, the man who makes her heart soar will perish under the most unfamiliar of circumstances, possibly not even knowing of the grand life he\u2019s led.\nThe movie is told within a framework of Blanchett\u2019s now-aged character on her death bed, during a hurricane, while her adult daughter reads from her diary - well, really, from Benjamin\u2019s diary, ensconced inside Daisy\u2019s. The daughter is played by Julia Ormond, who I mistook for Lolita Davidovich. I haven\u2019t seen Ormond in anything since I think Sabrina, and she looks fantastic; the scenes between her and Blanchett were heart-rending; Fincher used silence - and the approaching storm as background - with precision to greatest effect.\nAs for me, although the movie is long and necessarily lags in spots - there\u2019s only one action scene, but it\u2019s a doozy (if a tad unbelievable, even for this movie) - it\u2019s ultimately very satisfying, delivering on its premise in creative, bold, and mesmerizing fashion. It\u2019s not going to be for everyone, I would think, but it\u2019s beautifully told and very well acted."}

Rourke is phenomenal, delivering a powerful, highly physical performance that will knock your socks off as much as if he'd clotheslined you himself. Rourke's Randy is intrepid, a scarred battle cruiser who desperately needs to be in the ring to survive, a man who's emotions are kept as close to the vest as possible, a man with nothing else going for him other than his time in the spotlight.\nThe Ram, probably an amalgam of several real-life wrestlers (chief among them, Randy \"Macho Man\" Savage), is a relic of the 1980s, a man who wistfully counts the scars and cuts on his body and remembers with great fondness his greatest ring moment, a pay-per-view battle against The Ayatollah. But twenty years later, he's wrestling in high-school gymnasiums, barely able to put on a decent show but still basking in any glory he can find. But the gigs hardly pay at all, and more than once The Ram is unable to pay the rent on his mobile home.\nMeanwhile, two people enter (and reenter) Randy's life. Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) is a stripper at a low-rent club that Randy frequents. Cassidy is just about the only person in the world that Randy can talk to; he's lonely, spending most of his postmatch time either drinking alone or patching up any new wounds. He's treading water; with no life outside of wrestling, he's just trying to make it through the night intact.\nReentering Randy's life is his long-estranged daughter, played by Evan Rachel Wood, who's hated her dad for years after he abandoned the family. Randy, in case you're still not certain, is not meant to be an entirely sympathetic figure; you know why he is how he is, and you do feel bad for him, but you also understand that just about everything that's made him who he is today is due to his own decisions. The Ram is not a victim.\nAside from the simple I'm-getting-too-old-for-this angle, there's a serious medical angel that presents itself early in the movie - keep on wrestling, the doctor warns, and you'll likely die in the ring. And to his credit, Randy does attempt to stop his own livelihood, but he quickly - and harshly - realizes how incredibly difficult that is. The real world doesn't want him, The Ram thinks. They only want what's in the ring.\nRourke is outstanding, perhaps sparking his own career renaissance, and Tomei is simply terrific as Cassidy. Tomei is a perfect physical fit for the role of the rapidly aging stripper; she's still gorgeous, but there are just enough lines on her face to make her age believable. Tomei continues to make excellent role choices, and she completely knocks this one out of the park. Her Cassidy hurts as much on the inside - and what movie stripper doesn't? - as Randy appears to on the outside, and they have much in common. It's gratifying to see Cassidy's feelings toward Randy evolve throughout the movie.\nThere are also several matches featuring The Ram, one of which should really appeal to wrestling fans: a hardcore match. In this kind of match, literally anything goes - barbed wire, windows, tables, chairs, anything. Yes, we all know that pro wrestling is fake, but it's fake really only in terms of the final outcome, with just a few guidelines worked out between the competitors beforehand (e.g., I'll hit you low, then you leg whip me). And of course these particular matches were staged and scripted, but man did they ever look real. You want to see something scary, check out Randy after the hardcore match, when staples - from a staple gun - are removed from his body.\nThe Wrestler is a gritty, raw look at one man's desire to keep on keepin' on, trying to survive the only way that's still open to him, while trying desperately to connect with someone emotionally as he ages. It's heartwarming but also heart-wrenching, and the somewhat-ambiguous ending is sure to confound people who like their movies to end tidily. It's a masterpiece for Rourke, another tour-de-force for Tomei, and an award-worthy effort for Aronofsky."}

However, it does not completely escape its stage origins, as the film relies perhaps a little too heavily on words, rather than action, to get its muddied points across.\nSister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) is the forbidding principal of a Catholic school, of which Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is the priest. When the naive Sister James (Amy Adams) reluctantly comes to Sister Aloysius with concerns about Father Flynn's relationship with the only black child in the school (the film's set in 1964), the headmistress decides to get to the bottom of things - no matter the cost.\nStreep's role as the domineering, terrifying nun seems tailor made for another Oscar run - she's been nominated 15 times - but don't kid yourself; her towering performance will have you shaking in your boots if you ever attended Catholic school, and if you never did, like me, you'll be glad you didn't. She doesn't rap knuckles, because she doesn't need to. She is judge, jury, and executioner in her school - except she reports to the priest. Oops.\nWhat makes Streep's character work is that she's mean in the beginning and still mean at the end, so it's not as if she undergoes deep character development in two hours. Still, she's not without compassion, so when word reaches her that the priest - whom she does not particularly like - might have plied an altar boy with wine and then blamed the boy, her hackles, shall we say, get raised. Here, Streep brings the fire and brimstone with a vengeance. Her eyes blaze with fury so often you'll be worried she'll set the school on fire. (Like any good, disciplinary nun.) Streep's not alone with her strong performance. Hoffman is perfectly oily as the smarmy, condescending Father Flynn, a Good Guy who hobnobs with the bishop and is a pal to the kids, particularly the lone black kid. He seems, on the outside, to be a wonderful, beloved priest, and it's his progressive ways - let's have a secular song in our Christmas pageant! - that set Sister Aloysius before the impropriety even occurs. When confronted by the sisters, Father Flynn is ambiguous, then defensive, then explosive, and Hoffman powerfully depicts a man either losing control or in complete, unadulterated control.\nCompleting the troika is the young Sister James, played by the lovely Amy Adams, who looks - dare I blaspheme - absolutely adorable in a nun's habit. Adams is good here, definitely, and she provides the necessary innocence to offset the jaded veneer of Streep and the callous bluster of Hoffman, but sometimes her character just seemed to exist for the purpose of comic relief. Which seemed incongruous, since this movie tackles such serious subjects.\nDoubt is good to have, Father Flynn tells his flock, because it's a shared emotion; we all doubt. And the ending of John Patrick Shanley's movie (he adapted from his play) is so ambiguous that you're likely to feel what the protagonists are feeling, that what you had thought earlier might not be the truth of the matter at all."}

He is on the popular Indian game show \u201cWho Wants to Be a Millionaire,\u201d and he\u2019s just correctly answered a question worth ten million rupees. As the episode ends - a cliffhanger! - the young man is arrested and taken to police headquarters on charges of cheating in the game. How could a boy from the poorest area of the country do so well on this knowledge show? The tale unfolds under the withering questions by the police inspector. Jamal (Dev Patel) explains how he came to be able to answer the show\u2019s questions by describing his life, from his impoverished beginnings in Mumbai to his involvement with a Fagin-like misanthrope to his stint as an illicit tour guide at the Taj Mahal. Through it all, Jamal\u2019s relationships with the two closest people to him - his brother Salim and their new friend Latika - strongly inform his own decision-making abilities. Jamal\u2019s love for Latika, who we shortly learn is the impetus behind Jamal\u2019s appearing on the game show, and his envy (or fear) of Salim are the crucial cogs in Jamal\u2019s frightening existence.\nDirector Danny Boyle doesn\u2019t just show us the life and times of a poor Indian boy; if anything, that might make the movie more of a maudlin rags-to-riches story. No, this is a romance story, full of passion and undying love. No matter how many times Latika is separated from Jamal - he always finds her again, his heart pounding whenever she is near. It is for her that Jamal is on this game show, and as we learn, he knows the answer to each question he\u2019s been asked because he remembers a specific event in his life on the run that connects him to that question.\nJamal\u2019s journey from boyhood to early adulthood is fraught with danger; his mother his bludgeoned to death in front of him by an anti-Muslim mob, and the Fagin-like creep who takes the brothers in does horrible things to boys like them, especially if they can\u2019t carry a tune (and thus make money). But no matter what happens or where he lands in life, his thoughts are first and foremost with the beautiful Latika. Jamal believes it is written that they will be reunited, and because he believes it so strongly, we believe it, too.\nHardly a false note is rung in this spellbinding, electrifying movie. Everything feels authentic, not a show staged for the pursuit of Western dollars. (There cast is composed of mostly Indian actors, not ringer Americans with \u201cIndian\u201d accents.) Boyle\u2019s commanding, sure hand tells the dual stories of Jamal\u2019s upbringing and his time on the game show, bringing them both to the same - and powerfully emotional conclusion. Dry eyes are not likely in the final third of this movie."}

In all, it's a clever redo that will capture the viewer's imagination even if they've seen the original.\nThe key word here is \"update.\" I think that if you're going to remake a classic, you should do so if you can show a different angle, a new twist, to the original plot without decimating the original premise in the process. Here, director Scott Derrickson stays true to Klaatu's main point - fly right or fall - while altering some aspects of the original to better suit the times. For example, the robot Gort isn't just a big metal thing, he/it is a metal-organic hybrid, because naturally alien civilizations might have advanced past mere robotics.\nSo why is Klaatu here, anyway? Well, in general terms he's here to warn us to mend our ways, or else, but he doesn't get too far by trying to reason with us. As one might expect, since we don't take kindly to aliens landing in Central Park. Klaatu is eventually apprehended and interrogated, just as we'd expect the narrow-minded government to do. And he meets up with Dr. Helen Benson (Connelly), a macrobiologist called in by the feds to figure out what the heck's going on.\nConnelly and Reeves interact well, although it's tough to tell sometimes, since Klaatu isn't supposed to be the emotive type. But of course, neither is Reeves, which is why he's so well cast. In fact, perfectly so. Klaatu is measured in his responses and actions, and you never really know what his plans are; Reeves enigmatic demeanor is suitable. Connelly is believable as the single-(step)mom/superdoctor, too. She and Reeves aren't love interests here, which also contributes a lot to the efficacy of the plot. Too often straightforward stories are derailed somewhat by a forced romance angle. Not here. In this remake, the conflicts between man and alien, man and man, man and self are at center stage.\nAnd that gets at the crux of why this movie works: the impending doom of the planet is shown so vividly that you can't help but feel fearful yourself. Will Dr. Benson be able to convince Klaatu that the humans should be saved? What will happen, specifically, if she cannot? Her trepidation grips you; knowing that the fate of the planet's dominant species rests on your shoulders is a fearsome burden.\nThe downsides? Well, there aren't many, to be sure, but they do kind of hurt. Jaden (son of Will) Smith is cast as Benson's stepson, and he's surly and unforgiving and combative and just plain unlikable. Which isn't strictly young Master Smith's fault, certainly, but it makes it awfully hard to feel sympathy toward him. It's a little gallling, too, to see his attitude turn on a dime, in mere seconds, as if the first 45 minutes were just a big joke.\nI also wasn't too pleased with Kathy Bates as the secretary of defense, who's inexplicably left in charge of matters after the arrival of Klaatu and Gort. (Why not the president or veep? Oh, they're moved to separate undisclosed locations, where apparently they can't do anything.) Autocratic, illogical commanders are a dime a dozen in the movies, and Bates feels completely wasted here.\nStill, this remake really is a lot of fun, particularly during the high-octane action scenes, which are understandable despite being infused with CGI. In this case, it appears that the CGI works very well - check out the giant robot Gort and how it reacts to being shot at. Technically speaking, very well done indeed."}

I guess they felt that the last one, succinctly titled Hulk, was somewhat lacking. But perhaps it just wasn\u2019t meant to be; here we are, just a few years later, and the new Hulk movie is about as lifeless and predictable as the first, only with A-list actors suffering within it. The Incredible Hulk is ambitious but no more compelling or vivacious as an actual comic book, with one-dimensional characters and a perfectly horrendous stab at acting by the normally reliable William Hurt.\nI remember that one of the big knocks against Hulk was the unconvincing CGI. I think that problem is more or less resolved here, as the new and improved Hulk looks terrifyingly real, not just an ogre with a soft center but really menacing. Sadly, though, this Hulk has more personality and joie de vive than any of his live-action counterparts. It\u2019s perplexing, really, because this time around the studio opened up the checkbook for such bankable stars as Hurt, Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, and Tim Roth. They\u2019re all out acted by the fx (save Norton, who\u2019s just as effortlessly wonderful as always), which has to be a jolt to the ol\u2019 ego, but none greater than to Hurt, who has decades of flavorful, heavily nuanced performances on his resume.\nAs with most superheroes, Hulk is completely misunderstood. Bruce Banner has inflicted a metric ton of gamma rays on himself in the interest of science, only to find out the military for which he worked really wants to weaponize him, so he\u2019s hiding out in Brazil when the movie opens. Somehow, he has to get information back to an unknown scientist contact, before the army, led by General Ross (Hurt), finds him first. He also wants to reconnect with his girlfriend Betty (Tyler), who happens to be Ross\u2019 daughter. But darn the luck, he can\u2019t keep his heart rate low enough to avoid Hulking all over the place. So it\u2019s an protracted chase scene, with the faceless, heartless military running after the green thing.\nThere\u2019s a wild card here, too. If you\u2019ve read the comic books, you know there\u2019s always gonna be another Big Bad Guy to fight someone like Hulk, because sooner or later watching him swat away missiles like he\u2019s King Kong gets kind of dull. So writers gin up an even bigger dude for him to fight. Here, he\u2019s played by Tim Roth, who\u2019s a major following Ross\u2019s orders.\nThe CGI still isn\u2019t terribly believable, but sinking this one even further is the illogic of the plot. I love how nothing ever seems to hurt Hulk - bullets, shotgun shells, tanks, helicopters, they all roll off him and explode in a huge blast. But they keep firing anyway. Oh, and General Ross just keeps calling in bigger artillery. It ain\u2019t working, fool! But the best is that of course only Hulk and Hulk alone can stop Roth, even if he\u2019s not Hulky. Of course only he can save the day, him and his purple pants.\nI still can\u2019t get over the fact that William Hurt is playing this blustery, distant, single-minded authority figure. Was Powers Boothe not available? Kurtwood Smith? R. Lee Ermey? When I think of William Hurt, I think of quiet intellectualism. Sure, sometimes his characters are cold and aloof, but they\u2019re still sensitive and pining and not at all like the overreaching, despotic Ross. Weird casting doesn\u2019t always work, you know.\nNorton does his level best, but the movie\u2019s just a shambles. It\u2019s stereotypical comic-book fare, only it\u2019s not terribly interesting, and the effects are more akin to a good video game than an expensive Hollywood movie."}

Van Sant\u2019s masterpiece, certain to be noticed around Oscar time, is poignant enough to mist even the most hardened of souls while remaining frighteningly relevant even thirty years after Milk\u2019s murder.\nTo be fair, writer Dustin Lance Black had wonderful source material from which to derive his screenplay, as Milk\u2019s life was anything but placid, but he was able to tell his tale without getting sappy or maudlin, without the film\u2019s devolution into a whitewash. But although Black\u2019s screenplay is par excellence, this is Sean Penn\u2019s show. Penn has grown so much as an actor, even though most film critics still note his seminal Jeff Spicoli performance from 1982\u2019s Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Here, he disappears into the role of Harvey Milk, adapting some stereotypical - but not unheard of - mannerisms of gay men, but never going over the top, never coming close to lampooning his own subject. Penn\u2019s grip on Milk\u2019s inner psyche is devastatingly raw; he shows how much Milk cared about equality for all, even at the expense of life with his lover, Scott Smith (a pensive James Franco). This is a canard seen in many biopics, but here Penn\u2019s Milk is not unaffected by how he affects others; he is not single minded, he is merely driven.\nEven though he has comparatively little screen time, Josh Brolin is Penn\u2019s equal as Milk\u2019s twisted - and also quite conflicted - fellow city supervisor, Dan White. Since this is a biographical movie, it\u2019s not spoiling things to tell you that White is heavily involved in Milk\u2019s murder, but at no point does Brolin make you think he\u2019s just a hardheaded antigay jackass who\u2019s out to bust anyone who\u2019s not white and \u201cnormal.\u201d But it\u2019s not important how Milk dies, because the focus here is his life\u2019s work and how it affected not only the gay community - in San Francisco and nationwide - but also the straights, particularly singer Anita Bryant, who got it into her pretty little head in the mid-1970s that God hates gays, and therefore gays shouldn\u2019t get any rights at all. Her crusading begins in Florida, where she was once a popular orange-juice pitchwoman, and leads all the way to Milk\u2019s backyard.\nSet against the backdrop of the turbulence that gestated in the late 1960s and grew to angry fruition in the 1970s, Milk captures the feel of the period, sans sanctimony and hand wringing. Penn\u2019s work here should notch him his fifth Oscar nomination, perhaps even his second win; Van Sant should also get his second nomination as well. There really isn\u2019t much negative to say about Milk, unless you\u2019re bigot who\u2019s ashamed of how well Milk makes the case for equal rights for everyone."}
< {"rating": "7", "date": "15 November 2008", "title_id": "tt0830515", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "Solid followup to Casino Royale; grim closure", "content": "Even without the gimmicky gadgetry, the misogyny, and the Moneypenny, Quantum of Solace is an able entry in the long-running James Bond series. Although it is quite violent, the action is basically nonstop for the entire length of the movie, and Daniel Craig holds his own (again) as the now-towheaded, gritty superspy. Quantum of Solace is breathless and exhilarating, moving its minimalist plot so quickly that at times it's hard to tell exactly what's happening.\nThe action begins about one hour after the end of the last Bond film, Casino Royale, with a terrifying car-chase (and foot-chase) scene through an Italian town, as Bond is in hot pursuit of a man who may have some connection to the late Vesper Lynd of the previous film. Bond needs closure, you see; he needs to get over Vesper's death somehow, and to him that means finding out what she was all about. Through the course of his pursuits, he discovers that the trail leads to one Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), a shifty entrepreneur who runs an eco-first company (Greene, get it?). But this being a Bond movie, Greene isn't the be-all, end-all villain, is he? Well, there's also a corrupt Latin American dictator-in-waiting; perhaps he'll do. Vying for Bond Girl status are Camille (Olga Kurylenko), who of course is with the evil Greene, and Agent Fields (Gemma Arterton), who's an agent with MI6 (but who's also barely seen in the movie anyway).\nThe most striking difference between this and the other Bond films, save for Casino Royale, is how angry James Bond is. Craig does a slow burn very well; he's not bristling with contempt, but you can tell it's smouldering just beneath the surface. He's bent on revenge, a fact that M (Judi Dench) picks up on rather quickly, so the question is: Can Bond put aside his emotions to concentrate on finding something about the new super-secret organization, following in the footsteps of SMERSH and SPECTRE, that's behind everything? M doesn't trust Bond entirely, in part because in the two films since the reboot he's killed basically everyone who's gotten in his way, even people who might have been useful.\nBut what makes this a Bond movie, exactly? There's Bond and M, and there's a Bond Girl with an intentionally wacky name (Strawberry Fields, according to the credits, and yes, she's a redhead). Craig's Bond is charming and ruthless (often simultaneously), and he's not prone to the sardonic one-liners that preceding Bonds were prone to spout. Now, one could argue that those lines were cheesy and dopey, but what they did was offset the action scenes. You don't get that in QoS, really; Craig's Bond is a man of few words. And he's single minded and unrelenting, striving to come to terms with Vesper's death before his grief can completely consume him.\nEven with the rage and grimness, though, this is still quite an acceptable movie. After 46 years of Bond films, the audience has a good idea of what to expect from the movies: explosions, girls, chases, and Bond. Quantum of Solace, filmed in six countries, maintains the exotic-locale quotient, too, another staple of the series. (It would be too much to have James Bond do all of his spying in one country, certainly.) Jeffrey Wright returns (briefly) as CIA agent Felix Leiter, a character who's been in several of the Bond films (and was actually fed to Blofeld's sharks, off-screen, in Licence to Kill), and Jesper Christensen returns as Mr. White, last seen running at the end of Casino Royale. But there's no Q, and no Moneypenny, although rumor has it that both will appear in the next Bond film.\nOn the whole, Quantum of Solace is a satisfying popcorn movie. It's not overplotted - as had been the case with many others in the series - and the action is so frenetic that it is often tough to follow on its own merits, but because of the simplistic plot, one can put the pieces together easily anyway. One caveat: It seems that in many of those quick-paced hand-to-hand-combat scenes, Bond is dressed very similarly to his foe, thus making it difficult to tell who's winning. I'll never understand fight choreography. Oh, another question, too: If M is so darn smart, how come she sent an office clerk (Agent Fields!) to put Bond on a plane? Good Lord."}
< {"rating": "7", "date": "9 November 2008", "title_id": "tt1132626", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "Creative mayhem keeps franchise moving", "content": "It goes without saying, doesn\u2019t it, that if you didn\u2019t like the first umpteen movies in a horror series, you aren\u2019t likely to enjoy number umpteen and one. It\u2019s also a truism that the later you get into a horror franchise - or as I used to say, the higher the Roman numeral - the worse the movies will be. This is sometimes because more movies can mean bigger budgets, which can mean more special effects and less of a focus on plot. After all, those Freddy, Jason, and Michael movies had the same basic plot framework each time out - everyone tries to run from the very obvious, lurching murderer, he slices and dices them, one person survives, and so on. After a few movies of this, you might start watching them ironically.\nBut Saw breaks that mold a little bit. Oh, sure, you know who the bad guy is, or was. But obviously Jigsaw\u2019s death a few movies ago didn\u2019t end the story. Even finding out he had a new recruit - who also later died - didn\u2019t end things. And even finding out that that recruit might not have been the only person helping out Jigsaw doesn\u2019t put a damper on things. Such twists seem plausible, not gimmicky. In other slasher movies, the only exposure one would have to creativity on the screen would be the various ways people would be killed off. Everything else would be by the numbers.\nNow, on the one hand, Saw V might not make a lot of sense if you\u2019ve never seen any of the other ones. But it\u2019s not as bad in this area as, say, Lord of the Rings. With LoTR, if you hadn\u2019t seen the first two, you\u2019d be lost watching the third. That\u2019s not entirely true with Saw, because although there are countless references to the earlier films - and, indeed, some events take place parallel to events in other films - there\u2019s also a new thread to follow that makes sense in and of itself: five strangers awake in a room with no obvious escape; they all wear collars (all wired together, of course), and the keys to the collars sit in glass boxes on the other side of the room. They have a limited amount of time to get their collars off, because after the clock winds down, they\u2019re decapitated. Ahem.\nAlongside that drama, there\u2019s the unfinished business of the last movie. Who really is behind the Jigsaw murders now, with Jigsaw himself gone? We got our answer at the end of Saw IV (no spoilers here), but you\u2019re never really certain, up to the end, that that answer was authentic, either.\nI think what makes the Saw movies work for me is that they\u2019re not a simple matter of hacking people to bits. There\u2019s always some sort of twisted morality at play. Jigsaw makes people play his games because he wants them to be rehabilitated. He wants them to atone for their sins. As he famously tells his accomplice, he never killed anyone; he always gave them a way out. (Sure, sometimes that way out would be to cut off your foot to escape a chain, or to reach into a dead guy\u2019s intestines to retrieve a key, but those are ways nonetheless.) Jigsaw may be a broken man, but he\u2019s not an entirely vengeful one. Well, he is vengeful, sure, because he doesn\u2019t mind if the person winds up dead, but he\u2019s magnanimous (in his eyes); he wants them to choose their own path.\nI also like the creative gore. I like mayhem of this magnitude, but I gotta tell you - just trying to shock me isn\u2019t going to work. Saw is effective in that every \u201cgame\u201d is an elaborate plan that depends not only on excellent project-management skills but also on predicting how a particular person will react given a choice. Knowing human nature, Jigsaw says, means nothing is left to chance in his games.\nAs with the rest of the Saw movies, I had some questions. Now, there\u2019s nothing wrong with unanswered questions, really; not every loose end must be tied up. (And, truth be told, there are loose ends partly because there will be another Saw movie.) After mulling things over and researching a bit online, I had some plausible explanations for those questions. But even if I didn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t feel as if the movie was incomplete or a gyp.\nSaw is a sort of harmonious discord, ordered chaos that makes perfect sense when viewed from afar. But the terror that the victims feel is extremely palpable, and there are several scenes that might even force you to look away for a moment, as there are in all Saw movies. Of course, if you\u2019re in the theater for this one in the first place, you\u2019re probably not going to be too squeamish about the visceral violence. But even the droolingest slasher aficionado will nod approvingly at the tortuous, needle-threading plot that effectively sets up every last millisecond of bloodletting."}

In fact, if it weren't so clever, you'd think it was just another sex-obsessed cheapo teen flick, and if it weren't so dirty, you'd think it was just another cerebral comedy laced with knowing pop-culture references and a hint of snark. So like I said, it's like most of Kevin Smith's films, only more so. And not set in New Jersey and not featuring Jay and Silent Bob. But other than that, totally the same deal.\nZack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) are completely platonic roommates in a Pittsburgh suburb who've fallen on hard times. (It's tough to find money for the rent when you gotta have the new Fleshlight.) The power and the water get shut off, and it's Thanksgiving. And then, after a traumatic tenth high school reunion, it hits them: they'll have to make an adult film to make ends meet.\nSo the two irresistible comic forces of Kevin Smith and Judd Apatow, in the form of Rogen, don't so much collide as meet genially, shake hands, and genuflect. It's a great match, the acerbic, nerdy outlook of Smith and the populist ravings of Rogen; he's sort of like Brian O'Halloran of Clerks, only worlds more charismatic and likable, and he's got the comic timing of a Dick Van Dyke in his prime. Or, if you will, Robin Williams, complete with back hair.\nAs with the best Smith movies, there are several knee-slapping scenes that you won't want to watch with your parents. Just a warning. Hey, this movie almost got the dreaded NC-17 slapped on it, and it has \"porno\" right there in the dadblamed title, so you know it's not a cute-bunny-rabbit movie. Oh, and so you're even more forearmed, there's actual sex in the movie. Real people getting naked. Even some scenes of a taboo nature.\nThe basic gist is that Zack and Miri audition actors, write a script, find someone who can shoot, and find a location with the expected hijinks and missteps along the way. But even the expected stuff is wickedly funny, like when the entire movie nearly has to be scuttled because the storage locker in which they'd been filming had just been demolished. Or the reunion itself, where Miri learns that the hot guy who teased her throughout high school isn't quite what she'd imagined he'd turn out to be.\nBut at the center of the movie, past the raunch-encrusted outer layer, is a true heart. Can Zack and Miri make this porno, including their own sex scene, without exacerbating their own relationship? To dumb it down for some who might be within the core audience of this fine film, I'll be even blunter: Can they shtup without it meaning a wack-a-doodle thing? I mean, they both say it won't change anything, but we all know better, because we are not them.\nSmith's characters are, as usual, honest and authentic to a fault; Zack is an overbearing jackass at times, just like Seth Rogen was in Knocked Up, and Miri is self-absorbed and sort of dim. But both are extremely charming and hilarious, and this is due in part to the strong, robust script by Smith. This is the first Smith film, by the way, that's not set in or shot in New Jersey, and it's only the second not to feature Jay and Silent Bob, although it does have Jason Mewes as one of the porn stars and Jeff Anderson as the cameraman. (Anderson, it should be noted, is fantastic, doing a lot with the comparatively few lines he has.) I laughed a lot. I didn't cry at all, and I wasn't bored, so good times all around. Hey, I like Kevin Smith, and judging from the wild series of tubes that is the Internet, a lot of other people do as well. I think this movie's on par with most of his stuff, although it could never grab the raw virility of the low-low-low-budget Clerks, and it's really just a lot of fun to watch."}

Ultimately, because George W. Bush is still in office, a lot of what transpires in W. is still fresh in people's minds - from the march to war with Iraq under misleading pretenses to the president's choking on a pretzel. Had the movie come out a generation or so after Bush left office, it might have been more successful; as it is, we learn virtually nothing about the man or his policies that we didn't already know.\nTo be fair, one thing that separates Bush as a public figure from that of, say, Richard Nixon is that Nixon was just more vicious and angry, whereas Bush is just a clueless dolt who leans too heavily on others to tell him what to do. And although it's true that many of Bush's policies have been a complete disaster, Stone doesn't concentrate on their effect on the average person, choosing instead to methodically chronicle Bush's career, from college screwup to presidential screwup.\nThe movie might have worked better if there was a mystery to solve; for example, JFK had the whole was-there-a-second-assassin thing going for Jim Garrison to look into. So what does W. give us? Nothing new, just the same round table of yes men and warmongers surrounding Bush, successfully imploring him to make this decision or that to further their own agenda. No mystery there; we've seen it all before, and in real time.\nJosh Brolin is excellent as Bush himself, though. He may not look exactly like W, but he has the voice and the facial nuances down pat, so he really owned the part. It's not easy to play a public figure when you yourself don't really look like him, because you have to rely on your mannerisms and tics to draw attention away from the obvious incongruous physical appearance. Brolin's Bush is never really morally conflicted, never appears to have a crisis of conscience, which is pretty much how he's perceived now, anyway. Brolin does do an exemplary job of illustrating Junior's conflict with his dad, the former president; seems younger brother Jeb was the favored sibling and was being groomed to follow in his dad's footsteps, while little Georgie was perpetually drunk, stoned, and chasing the women.\nIn fact, much of the cast does a game job, particularly Richard Dreyfus in a remember-me? role as Vice President Cheney, reining in the scowling and grimacing to simply put forth his own vision of how things should be. James Cromwell and Ellen Burstyn, as George and Barbara Bush, are also spot on, as is Toby Jones (a Brit) as Karl Rove, Jeffrey Wright as Colin Powell, and Bruce McGill as George Tenet. The latter two, incidentally, captured the essence of their characters perfectly - Powell as the stalwart soldier who's cowed into fibbing to the UN, and Tenet as the CIA head who was sure that the yellowcake information was a slam dunk.\nWorthy of special recognition is Elizabeth Banks as Laura Bush. Banks is beautiful, better looking than the real Laura Bush ever has been, but she applies a sort of delicate insistence to George when she disagrees with him, somehow separating herself from most political wives. Her small-town-librarian attitude gently counterbalances Bush's arrogant frat-boy entitlement outlook, just as it does in real life.\nOf the multicharacter cast, though, there was one negative standout - Thandie Newton as a listless Condoleeza Rice. Newton's not given much to say, but she comes off more simpering and useless than I would have imagined; she seems more like a servant than anything else, there merely to prop up her boss. Which, I understand, is one perspective that might be rooted in reality, at least a little, but Newton's coquettish grinning merely made her part of the background, rather than the major player the real-life Condi is/was. Rice in real life, though capable of making tragically terrible decisions, is at least extroverted enough to hold her own with the president. Here, the over-sized belt buckles on some of the Texan high rollers had more verve and personality.\nThe bottom line is that W is too shallow and too narrowly focused to be more than of passing interest. It's a shame, because there's a plethora of issues that could have been explored further, including how Bush's poor decisions led to direct suffering on the part of the American people. But it just might be that not enough time has passed (indeed, none at all) for sound, objective judgment to be passed as to the ultimate legacy and character of the 43rd president."}

The movie does deliver some intrigue and some compelling performances (not to mention some mailed-in ones), but huge lapses in logic that might be detected even by the youngest audience member prevent it from being the heart-stopping classic it wants to be.\nSome 200 years ago, life on Earth was dying, and in its waning moments great physicists, inventors, and architects designed and built a huge underground city powered by a gigantic generator. The Builders, though, possess some forethought and, assuming that someday the surface will again be inhabitable, they enclosed specific instructions for the citizens of Ember to eventually escape to the sunlight. This information was placed inside a metal box and alarmed with a 200-year timer; by the end of that time, the Builders reasoned, the surface would be habitable. This box was then handed off from mayor to mayor for nearly 200 years. But, as might be expected, the chain broke somewhere along the way, and at present the box sits in a closet, its owner unknowing of its raison d'etre. So here we are, 200 years down the road, and the lights in Ember flicker occasionally, sometimes more than occasionally, and it's apparent to a few that the generator's days are numbered.\nOur story focuses on two children, Lina Mayfleet (Saoirse Ronan) and Doon Harrow (Harry Treadway). At the movie's outset, each has received his and her assigned job for life - Lina as a messenger (all verbal), and Doon working in the pipeworks, where he hopes to find a way to save the generator. During the course of their duties, as the blackouts increase, each learns about the mysterious silver box, and they team up to decipher the tattered remnants of the exit instructions. Naturally, they run into complications with Doon's father (Tim Robbins) and the current mayor (Bill Murray), and just as naturally they're eventually pursued by people who'd just as soon no one ever figured out how to leave the dark city.\nFor the most part, the casting is on target; Ronan seems a lot more engaging and appealing here than she did just last year in Atonement, and Treadway, although looking like a refugee from High School Musical, is just as impressive. Robbins is excellent in a small, but pivotal role, as is Martin Landau (whatever became of him?) as the requisite old-guy-who-sort-of-knows-stuff. The only puzzling casting is that of Murray as the town's jovial mayor; he seems glib and cheerful enough, but it almost feels like he's being ironic, rather than being a part of the story. Often, this sort of approach makes for a hammy performance, but Murray's too subtle here for pure hamminess; he's more like a square peg in a round hole.\nThe lapses in logic take some willful ignorance to, well, ignore. We see various businesses and transportation, but there's apparently no police, no cemeteries, no fresh fruit. Now, bear in mind that these people have been down there for two centuries. Sure, they have a lot of canned goods, but something tells me they'd be in poor health after a lifetime of poor eating habits. Then there's the fact that everyone seems clueless about the surface. I don't mean that they don't know what's on it; they don't even know there IS a surface. Attempting to leave the city is a jailable offense, okay, but these people don't even know there's something to escape to. And that makes no sense right there. They haven't been down there for 2000 years, just 200. That means approximately nine generations after the ones who first lived there, and in often there are three generations alive at any given time. So it's not tough to imagine the tales of the outside world being orally handed down from generation to generation, tales of Super Bowls, Shakespeare, Sex and the City, and Snoopy. But apparently the first generationers vowed never to speak of their upper lives again, or something.\nCity of Ember is pretty fascinating and not complex, meaning it'll grab you (and, more importantly, teens and younger) and not force you to figure things out in order to keep up with the plot. Yes, there are twists and turns, but there aren't huge lapses in logic, at least nothing to dissuade you from staying through to the end. The end, by the way, is satisfying, even beautifully rendered. This might be one time (of many) to read the book, too. Or instead."}

But of course, this being a Hollywood film, the little guy fights back against the big, mean corporation, losing his family, wife, and sanity in the process.\nBob Kearns (Greg Kinnear) is an engineering professor who comes up with the idea of the intermittent blade while driving his family - wife and six kids - home from church one rainy afternoon. He puts together a prototype and shops it to Ford, which quickly warms to the idea. Then suddenly changes its mind, saying it\u2019s just not ready. And then double-plus suddenly, there are all these Ford cars on the road with those very same wiper blades. This is probably not a coincidence.\nWhat follows is your standard David/Goliath courtroom drama, without the courtroom (save for the finale). Bob fights back against Ford, but no one, not even high-powered attorney Alan Alda, really wants to help. Worse still, Bob doesn\u2019t even want a cash settlement, he wants an apology from Ford, an acknowledgment that they stole his awesome idea. This might surprise you, but they decline to do so.\nOn the one hand, this is a straightforward story about the little buy fighting back against all odds, taking on the big automakers at a time when the Big Three reigned supreme. After all, Ford has all the time in the world to devote to defending itself against Kearns\u2019 claims, whereas Bob has to scrimp and hope he can make some headway; they can outlast him as surely as a rock can outlast a summer storm. They have resources, and all he has is his devoted family.\nWell, not so much. Devoted to a point, perhaps. The strain of the legal battles soon take their toll on Bob and his wife, Phyllis (Lauren Graham), as well as the various kids. Which brings us to the second, even more important, conflict in this story, that between Bob and Everyone Who Means Something To Him.\nThis is an innocuous, slight movie; it doesn\u2019t grab you so much as kind of pull you along reluctantly, until the final, courtroom scene. The rule for courtroom dramas seems to be this: If the protagonist has been built up sufficiently but the audience does NOT tear up when the inevitable verdict is read, then the movie is a failure. I mean, it\u2019s really not complicated. If there\u2019s no payoff, then everything leading up to that point has been for naught, so everyone involved has to pull off that final scene. The nice thing is that pulling off that scene, otherwise known as manipulating the audience, is pretty elementary, high-school stuff. It\u2019s tough to mess it up.\nAnd they don\u2019t. True to form, that final scene makes up for all the methodical pacing of the other 90 minutes or so. Kinnear\u2019s earnest and well cast, and Graham is a delight as his doting, no-nonsense wife. Alda\u2019s showy role doesn\u2019t really amount to much at all, contrary to what the trailer showed. But all in all, it\u2019s a well done, if somewhat forgettable, movie."}

That means, to me, it rocks out loud. Although this biting, dirty minded look at sex addiction, lust, bondage, and masturbation isn't suitable kiddie fare, or teen fare, its refusal to treat its lead character as, pardon the pun, a hunk of meat vapidly acting out his own fantasies actually forces you care about him far more than he'd ever care about you.\nVictor Mancini (Sam Rockwell) is, plain and simple, a sex addict; he even attends meetings, where they have a multistep program designed to cure people of their addiction, same as for other addictions. Meanwhile, his mom (Anjelica Huston) lays in a nursing home, showing progressive signs of dementia (she rarely recognizes him), and to finance his mother's hospital stay, Victor runs cons. One of his cons is that he causes himself to choke in restaurants, allowing Good Samaritans to save his life; they're so concerned for him that they often give him money later to help him, or something. Then he gives the money to the not-benevolent nuns who run the hospital where his mother is incarcerated.\nAlong the way, of course, Victor humps everything in sight, because he's not just an addict, he's an unrepentant addict. His best friend Denny (Brad William Henke), is also an addict - he's a chronic masturbator - and is often complicit in Victor's dealings.\nVictor meets his match, physically, in a doctor (Kelly Macdonald) caring for his mother; unlike with the scores of other women, Victor somehow can't, uh, finish the job with Dr. Marshall. Maybe he - gulp - loves her? Nah, can't be.\nBut lest you think this is just about some pervert's odyssey to self-actualization and empowerment, a real learning experience for all, it's just plain not. Victor doesn't learn diddly, no pun intended. (And if you recognize where a pun might have appeared there, you're the intended audience of this movie.) His journey isn't to find himself, or to better himself, it's to find out a little about his past, particularly the identity of his real father, as Mom schlepped the young Victor around for years, on the run from the police for crimes unspecified (although it's alluded that she was involved in violent protests). Now she's completely vulnerable, but her memory's not entirely reliable, either. But again, this ain't no touchy-feely heartwarming tale of a mother-son bond, not at all; Victor just wants information before his ailing mom joins the choir invisible.\nRockwell is fantastic, perfect with his adorable-to-women, lost-puppy face; he's not strapping, he's not hot-with-two-Ts, he's just some schmoe with apparently irresistible, endless charm. Huston is solid as his mother - both in the present and in flashbacks, where she recalls another of her famous characters, Morticia Addams - and Henke is a real hoot as Victor's handy (another pun) pal. Adding equal parts sexiness and mystery is Macdonald as the leggy doctor who comes to love Victor, however inexplicably.\nChoke is raucous and profane, but there's oddly no gratuitous nudity or sex. Well, not gratuitous from where I'm sitting, if you know what I mean. But seriously, what's in there is relevant to the plot. How could it not be, though, when your protagonist is addicted to coitus?"}

In 1995, the megastars appeared in Michael Mann's Heat as tough guys on opposite sides of the law. But it wasn't enough. We want more Decino, said the fans. Finally, thirteen years after Heat, we get both De Niro and Pacino on the same side of the law, as veteran NYPD cops up to their necks in corruption and murder.\nRooster (Pacino) and Turk (De Niro) have been partners for a long, long time. Rooster is a little slicker, a little more PR-savvy, a little more in tune with what's going on around him. Turk is more bombastic, blunt, salivating. They're not quite like Bert and Ernie, more like Ratso Rizzo and Ratso Rizzo. At any rate, some time in the distant past the two of them conspired to frame a murderer-rapist who'd gotten off scot free, and now that particular action is coming back to haunt them. Seems there's a serial killer on the loose in the big city, a fiend who leaves calling cards with rhymed couplets written on the back.\nTrouble is, people soon start to assume that it's a dirty cop behind all this killing. And it's not innocent people being gunned down, either, it's really bad people. Essentially, New York has another vigilante on its hands, although no one in this movie mentions the term.\nNow, sometimes when a long-rumored on-screen pairing finally takes place, the results are sort of negligible. As in, okay, great, they're both there, but their combined presence doesn't add anything to the film. But here, the chemistry between the two - sort of a thespian Force - is iron strong, and the result is that you don't just get two Stars doing their patented unhinged-cop acts, you get two masters of their craft who really believe in the script and who work hard at it without seeming to labor.\nAt times, the story feels a little tired and used, but the feeling quickly dissipates, mainly because writer Russell Gewirtz (Inside Man) throws in little hooks here and there to catch you off guard. Like how Turk's paramour (Carla Gugino), who's with Forensics, is really, really into the whole abuse game in and out of bed. And I don't mean simple stuff like handcuffing her to a bedpost, either. Or how, for once, the lieutenant (Brian Dennehy) actually believes his cops when they tell him things, like Officer X might be corrupt. Things like that don't often happen in cop movies. (The movie even recalls, to an extent, Pacino's own long-ago foray into the minigenre, in 1973's Serpico. Coincidentally, a guy named Terry Serpico has a bit part in the film.) And God help me, but I didn't see the magical twist coming. Really, I didn't. Maybe I'm just slow on the uptake. I was committed to seeing the movie end along one track, but boom! Turns out all my assumptions were wrong, based on false premises. And for once, it's not that the twist is unobvious because it's, well, ridiculous. This one makes perfect sense in hindsight, so for me it's an optimal thriller.\nBut the real draw here is the team-up of De Niro and Pacino. For once, neither actor settles into playing a clich\u00e9d version of his earlier characters, since they've each played cops a multitude of times. They could easily have had Pacino as the wacko mercenary hiding behind the badge and De Niro as the wily, sick psychopath bent on destruction. That's pretty much what I expected, but instead we get a return to Early Days Pacino and De Niro, with two perfectly nuanced performances in an otherwise fairly straightforward cop caper."}
< {"rating": "4", "date": "25 September 2008", "title_id": "tt0473700", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "Exploitative, one-dimensional", "content": "September Dawn Based (loosely?) on a true story of a 19th-century clash between Mormons and Christians in Utah, September Dawn is graphically violent, daring you to find something of value within the bloodletting. In the end, you don't care much about the renegade Mormons who attack the Christians, and you don't care much about the too-pure-for words Christians, either. Against this backdrop is the requisite made-up romance between young folks from either tribe, which here feels more than a little artificial and contrived.\nJon Voight plays the Mormons' sheriff, bishop, and lord of all that is righteous. He and his followers are mad because their religion's leader, Joseph Smith, was killed by an Arkansas mob suspicious of his many-wives-having lifestyle. So when a group of Christian pilgrims, traveling west to California to supply horses for gambling purposes, passes through his rural town, he's not exactly glad to see them. He has his sons keep an eye on the settlers, who need a place to rest themselves and their horses. Soon Voight's riled up the townspeople that it's God's will that they attack the Christians.\nThere's a lot of hellraising and damnation in this movie. Fire-and-brimstone stuff, is what I'm saying. The Mormons in this movie are basically sheep, except for Samuelson's (Voight) kid Jonathan, who is not in tune with the ways of his father. He likes to think for himself, you see, and it's not long before he's caught the eye of the lovely Emily, the daughter of the Christians' pastor. The star-cross'd lovers, obviously, wind up at the heart of the conflict between the two religious parties.\nEveryone, though, regardless of the Big Man to whom they pray, is pretty self-righteous. How could they not be, when it's a story about religious extremism? Well, everyone, of course, except for the star-cross'd lovers. It's always the youngsters who don't completely buy in to the value systems of their fathers. (It's also worth noting that neither Emily's nor Jonathan's mother is still alive; both are now being raised by single papas.) Reminds me of Footloose, really, when whatshername's dad, played by John Lithgow, was all about the righteous anger and was really put out by the antics of the city boy played by Kevin Bacon.\nWith all this self-righteous behavior comes an even surlier companion: the demonization of Other People. But here it's the Mormons and the Mormons alone who are intolerant. They presume that these Christians are the ones who killed their sainted Smith. They presume that all Christians are murderers in their hearts, anyway. They dislike the fact that they're herding horses to be used for the somewhat immoral purpose of gambling. They're also annoyed that one of the Christians is a single female who wears pants, not a dress, and who carries weapons. Blasphemy! So of course they must all die.\nAnd when I say the Mormons here want to kill their Christian visitors, I mean they want a wholesale slaughter. Women and children, too. Samuelson gets them all frothing at the mouth, then he gets the local Indian tribe to attack the interlopers. When the Christians come to the Mormons for help, they walk into a second, even larger ambush, and hardly anyone's spared.\nSometimes conflicts like this play out pretty well on the big screen. It's a timeless theme, after all, that of religious intolerance. But here, what was lacking were compelling side stories and characterizations. Everyone's pretty one dimensional - either delusional or self-absorbed, perhaps both - and no one gives you much to care about. Enter the somewhat forced romance between Emily and Jonathan. Can it end happily? It's not likely, given that there's a wholescale slaughter. They spend half the movie making moon eyes at each other and professing love, but I'll grant them half a pass on it, since we're talking about the ancient 19th century, and they couldn't help but be chaste, anyway. But just half a pass, because they bored me.\nThe one character who could have sparked some interest is barely in the movie - she's played by Lolita Davidovich - for unknown reasons. I suspect she was in the movie only to give the Mormons something else to whine about. \"Why, tarnation! The woman's in pants! String her up!\" Davidovich was fantastic in the five minutes or so she was on screen. Imagine how much better the movie would have been if her Nancy Dunlap had been the one to fall for a Mormon boy/man? If you can stick it out to the end, the carnage isn't for weak stomachs. It's not so much an overabundance of blood that'll get you, it's the sick, exploitative nature of the beast. Women are shot from behind. Kids are stabbed. The extremely vulnerable are hunted down like chipmunks. It's a little gut wrenching, to say the least, and it makes one wonder what the overall point was supposed to be. That Mormons are bad and Christians are good? That something evil took place on those Utah plains? The banality of evil? I dunno."}

Yes, Hamlet is able to use the time machine to go into the past and stop Queen Gertrude and Ophelia from dying painful deaths. Oh! And he gets a little help from another father-conflicted man: Jesus! Marschz is down on his luck. His marriage to Brie (an acerbic Catherine Keener) isn\u2019t doing well, and the high school at which he teaches, slavishly, is dumping the arts programs from its curriculum in cost-cutting moves. His school productions have traditionally stunk rather badly, and he\u2019s constantly ravaged in the press - that is, the student newspaper. After a particularly scathing (but accurate) review, Marschz knuckles under and doubles down and decides to write his own original play, rather than taking successful movies and adapting them poorly for the stage.\nThe result is Hamlet 2, wherein Hamlet, Jesus Christ, the president of the United States, Satan, Hillary Clinton, and other cultural icons appear. There\u2019s profanity, there\u2019s nudity, there\u2019s depravity, there\u2019s disrespect. Why, in short, it\u2019s a blockbuster Hollywood movie. But no, this is meant for the wee minds of the parents and other citizens of Tuscon, Arizona. If that sounds demented and disturbing, well, it is. Marschz\u2019s idea is to throw everything into this play that he can think of, because the school\u2019s cancelling his drama program anyway, so what\u2019s he got to lose? Turns out, not much. As word of mouth builds about the play, half the town wants to crucify (ha! and they use that joke, too) Marschz, and the other half is intrigued. Soon, his case is taken up by the ACLU, in the person of Cricket Feldstein (Amy Poehler), who\u2019s more overbearing and braying than useful and funny. The movie would have been just as good, perhaps better, had that character not existed.\nThere are plenty of references early on to other unique-teacher movies, such as Dangerous Minds and Mr. Holland\u2019s Opus. But Marschz isn\u2019t the inspiring-teacher type, really; he\u2019s a complete screwup who can\u2019t write. The kids aren\u2019t suddenly awesome thespians, although it seems most of them can carry a tune very well. But the focus, for the first two-thirds of the movie, isn\u2019t on the play, anyway; it\u2019s on Marschz and how he deals with all of the obstacles life is throwing at him. The upside of that role is that a talented comedic actor would have a field day with it, as it would permit one to be wacky and unhinged, much like a younger Robin Williams. But Coogan\u2019s not that guy. He seems a bit miscast, and even though many of the jokes fall flat, he makes \u2018em worse by being just plain terrible. He\u2019s just not funny.\nOn the plus side, Elisabeth Shue plays herself. Well, herself if she had retired from making movies to be a nurse in Arizona. She doesn\u2019t have a lot of scenes, but she sparkles in them, and she works well with Coogan (good chemistry, that is), so her presence is very good. Plus I always get a kick out of people playing themselves in movies that aren\u2019t biographies, you know? It\u2019s just a level of self-awareness you don\u2019t normally get from Actors.\nThe bottom line, though, is that the movie would be an abysmal failure, devoid of laughs and, well, interest, if it weren\u2019t for the requisite performance at the ending. Even though you know it\u2019s coming - hey, the entire movie\u2019s been building up to it - the result is so wonderful, so perfectly apt, and so outstanding in every way that it makes up for the previous hour or so of kvetching and overacting. See, unless these denouements operate on all cylinders, an entire movie will collapse. For a good comparison, check out 1991\u2019s Hear My Song, starring (somewhat implausibly) Ned Beatty as a reclusive tenor. If his performance in the final scene isn\u2019t a four-star knockout show, there IS no movie, and it\u2019s the same here. For most of the movie, I was a little bored, running into the occasional bout of amusement, perhaps a chuckle here and there, but the actual performance of the play was incredible."}

It used to be that he wrote for the masses, albeit the educated, urbane masses. So maybe he just needs to get back to his New York roots (again), but for the love of Gene Shalit, could he please stop turning in such bland crap? Does anyone else remember when Allen had a real knack for snappy dialog? For characters who seemed as real as the veins on your hand? When his movies were clever, not predictable? When each movie contained a rich, vibrant atmosphere that drew from both negative and positive aspects of The Big Apple? Or did I dream about all of those movies? Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a big dud. It's about a love/lust pentagon that involves titular friends (Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johannson), on vacation in the titular town, who encounter Bohemian painter Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem). But Vicky's engaged to a sanctimonious tool (Chris Messina), and then Juan Antonio's unstable ex-wife (Penelope Cruz) shows up as well. And it being Spain, everyone's got lust on the brain, and there's plenty of partner swapping.\nTo begin with, the movie's far too talky. True, many of Allen's early movies were just as reliant on dialog, but in those cases - I'm looking your way, Annie Hall and Manhattan - the dialog was florid and witty. Here it's dull and placid. So you get these long stretches where two of the characters, whomever they are, will talk, and talk, and talk endlessly about whatever their current situation is, without doing much about it. These people are the poster children for passive-aggressive behavior; even when they do act on something, it's devoid of passion and meaning.\nExcept, of course, when Cruz shows up. Before we even meet her, Maria Elena is shown to be idolized by Juan Antonio, even after she stabbed him with a knife. She's shown as this fiery charmer with whom the charming Juan Antonio had a love-hate relationship, and when Cruz finally does appear on screen, you can see the attraction and tension between them. This is partially because of how well Bardem and Cruz work together here but also because the other actors have virtually no charisma, not even the free-wheeling, carefree, doesn't-know-what-she-wants Cristina (Johannson).\nBut it's not just the talkiness and the lack of passion, it's the fact that this is a Woody Allen movie that behaves more like a John Badham movie, a movie that is virtually indistinguishable from other movies in the genre 0 in this case, romantic melodrama, I assume. On the plus side, it's not as horrendous as Allen's Match Point, which started out as a romantic melodrama and then inexplicably transformed into a deranged-stalker/murderer movie, but that doesn't make this a good movie by any stretch.\nPerhaps it's a bit unfair to compare this to Allen's old movies, since everyone evolves, but I do wish he'd come back to writing about middle-class characters instead of these well-to-do, conceited knuckleheads. Watching his upper-class fables reminds me more of Merchant-Ivory dramas than anything else, and perhaps we should leave those movies to the likes of Merchant and Ivory, or Whit Stillman. This is a costume-drama period piece sans costumes or, uh, a period. It's wildly predictable - you can guess the sexual permutations about 20 minutes early - and a boring footnote to the master's long career."}

The bench sitter sighs, and after a moment heads into the alleyway after them. A billion gunshots are fired, forty heptillion gallons of blood are spilled - but none by our hero - and we're off and running on a quirky, gore-filled adventure that's alternately clever and stupid. Mostly stupid. Really, really stupid.Mr. Smith (Clive Owen) finds himself the unwilling caretaker of the newborn, but if you think he's just going to go on the run from whoever was shooting at the now-dead momma, you're in for a surprise. No, Mr. Smith is more like Mel Gibson's character in the underrated Payback, wherein Mel beats the holy crap out of everyone in his path just to get back some money he was owed. Mr. Smith simply shoots or stabs (sometimes with a carrot, and we all know how deadly those can be) everyone in his path just to find out who's shooting at him and the baby. He's not alone, though; since everyone knows guys can't do the rearing-babies thing, he recruits an old flame who happens to be a lactating prostitute (Monica Bellucci) to take care of lil' Oliver. Bellucci, perhaps most famously seen in the Matrix movies, is the prettiest wooden drugstore Indian you ever did see. All she can do is purse her lips, puff up her chest, and nurture, nurture, nurture, as literally and graphically as you might imagine.\nSee, Shoot 'Em Up isn't just dumb, it's profoundly dopey, with crazy stunts that aren't even remotely rooted in reality. This might be okay if the movie were animated, but as the characters all exist in what appears to be the normal world, all you're left with is a swarm of implausibility and ridiculousness.\nOwen is earnest, but he's obviously much more talented than the script allows him to be; Mr. Smith is a comic-book character who doesn't even get bloodied himself until an hour into the mess, whereas the total body count (bad guys, of course) is somewhere around 100 people. Remember those old ninja films where the bad guys in black would surround the good guy and then take turns beating him down? That happens here, only there's no beating down, just a lot of standing around and getting shot. In fact, no joke here, the chief bad guy (Paul Giamatti, also playing below his station) has scads of opportunities to waste Smith throughout the movie, but true to movie-villain form he decides to deliver soliloquies about how freaking awesome he and his plan are. Unreal. He stands there, preening and gloating, giving Smith ample time to get away. And this happens not just once, no, this happens many times. Dumbest. Villain. Ever.\nThere's a running gag about how Smith loves carrots (and hates everything else in the world; he's like a stand-up comedy act in Hell); he uses them in inventive ways during his attacks on the faceless bad guys: as missiles, as sharp instruments of death, as ways to catch a falling handgun, and so on. None of these usages makes Smith any more appealing as a character. They just make me think he must have great eyesight.\nThere's even a brief homage to the scene in Raising Arizona when Nicolas Cage leaves the Huggies in the middle of the road and goes back to get 'em at full speed. Well, maybe it's not an homage, because my guess is that the makers of Shoot 'Em Up would never have bothered watching a movie with such superior stunts and chase scenes. Yes, even the stunts are moronic, because one mustn't merely suspend disbelief, one must throw it off a cliff and laugh maniacally.\nOh, and there's some kind of story about harvesting babies for their bone marrow, but obviously no one gave much thought to the plot, which serves only as a device for people to get shot at as if in the middle of a treacherous game of Contra on the old eight-bit Nintendo system.\nDirector Michael Davis offers little reason for anyone to watch his movie, other than a brief topless glimpse at Bellucci during her sex scene with Owen - not spoiling anything there, when there's one hero and one girl, they're going to sleep together at some point. It's a movie law."}

Oh, Cruise may attempt self-parody, but he never gives you the impression that he is aware he's making fun of himself - he seems to be saying, \"Hey, I'm an actor, look at me act!\" I've mocked Stiller many times. The guy's a ham, he's a bad actor, and his whiny, petulant behavior in almost every movie is annoying. But he does have a sense of what's funny. For example, when I popped Night at the Museum into the DVD player, I was sure it was going to be full of inept jokes and overexaggerated characterizations, and I was happily surprised, because he was the normalized center of a chaotic maelstrom.\nAnd I will further admit that I had reservations about Tropic Thunder as well, since Stiller directed, co-wrote, and coproduced it. This can't end well, I thought, even with Robert Downey, Jr. and Jack Black along for the ride. But it IS good, and for an entirely different reason from Night at the Museum: Stiller, playing an overmuscled action hero, sends up not only the Rambos of the world but also his own high-maintenance, tightly wound on screen (and off) persona. He points and laughs at himself so that we may join in, and that's a level of self-awareness that only those with impeccable comic cred can pull off.\nThe story of Tropic Thunder goes like this. A director (Steve Coogan) of a big-budget Vietnam War movie, tiring of dealing with his prima donna stars (Stiller, Black, Downey, Jr.), allows the grizzled veteran (Nick Nolte) who wrote the book on which the movie is based to move the film shoot to the jungles of Vietnam, where the actors will be dropped to fight the real North Vietnamese in a prime, and punny, example of guerrilla film-making.\nApologies for that run-on sentence. Let me put on my Movie Voice-over Guy hat: \"They came from a world in which they held all the cards. Now they find... they're all jokers.\" You can't beat Movie Voice-over Guy for plot summaries.\nEveryone is perfectly cast. Stiller's character is coming off a series of action-franchise movies of declining quality and popularity. Black plays an Eddie Murphy clone in that he's best known for playing multiple characters in flatulence-embracing comedies. Downey, Jr. is an Australian superactor who's won five Oscars and who prepares for this movie by getting controversial pigmentation surgery to look like an African American. I know, I know, it sounds like he's dressing in black face, which is obviously and patently racist, especially in this day and age. Downey, Jr.'s Kirk Lazarus is known as a Method actor, a guy who gets deep, deep, deep into his roles, so he doesn't just walk the walk, he also talks the talk. Dude never breaks character.\nBut this isn't just a high-octane movie with pithy punchlines; it's a raunchy ensemble piece peppered with perfectly knowing, crisp dialog. Black, Downey, Jr., and Stiller all work very well together, and since they're essentially playing actor archetypes, you can easily buy what they're selling.\nOn a hugely positive note, check out the fake trailers before the actual movie of the most recent films completed by the lead actors's actors. On a hugely negative note, check out an almost unrecognizable Cruise as a studio head. Well, unrecognizable until he opens his fat (you'll see) yap. It's a completely pointless cameo that adds nothing to the film, instead distracting and detracting. I don't know who okayed his appearance here, and maybe he thought it would rejuvenate his image a little, but I hope we never have to see Tom Cruise in a fat suit again.\nBut. Leave that aside for a moment. The movie does rock out loud, as the kids used to say, and there's plenty of mayhem, and profanity, and yes, drug humor. I like movies that don't flinch, comedically, from envelope-pushing topics. Each actor plays his role to the hilt - including Matthew McConaughey as a laid-back agent - and, working in unison, they churn out a respectable, clever war comedy. Ignore the critics who say the movie is racist toward black people - it isn't - or that it's hateful toward the mentally challenged - it's not. It's easy to step over the line separating parody from mockery, and this movie dances on the line but never crosses it."}

It's not helped by a particularly vicious and selfish lead character, played by Thora Birch, but it IS helped by finding its heart and soul about three-quarters of the way in. How much this movie appeals to you will depend on how well you identify with Birch's Enid, an iconoclast who delights in her displeasure with just about everything and everybody. But it's how her character relates to Buscemi's schlubby Seymour, with a relationship that evolves from cruel to curious to tender, that might well sell you on the entire premise.\nEnid and Becky (Birch and Johannson) are recent high school grads who don't quite buy in to the optimistic and/or clueless nature of their fellow classmates. They're sort of like Goths without the monochrome wardrobe. The girls are the sort who like to hassle fellow classmates - including their friend Josh (the late Brad Renfro), who works at a local convenience store - just for kicks. They're like the Mean Girls without the awesome hair. At any rate, they're looking for trouble one day when they decide to answer a personals ad just to mess with the sender. They set up a blind date; snickering behind their hands, they watch Seymour get stood up by the date that would never arrive.\nBut that's only the beginning of things, as the trio find themselves drawn together, improbably. Enid, a perpetual loner, is intrigued by the self-described dorky Seymour, who's content with his old-time interests (including a vast 78-rpm record collection) and has basically given up on a life outside of his apartment and job. Becky, on the other hand, is a bit skeptical of the budding relationship between her best friend and Seymour, who's certainly much older than either of them.\nAlthough this may seem like a study of what happens to two conniving girls after they pull a prank on someone who's totally not cool, it's really the story of the evolution of Enid's character - in fact, Enid is really the main character here, with Seymour and Becky playing lesser roles (contrary to the movie's poster). The complexities of her relationship to her former mark are explored rather well; there's a physical attraction, perhaps, but more importantly Enid sees in Seymour a way for her to redeem herself. After all, if she can help him improve his life, then the stain of her mean-spirited prank will be steam-cleaned away.\nThe acting is pretty good, but Buscemi, in an understated, nuanced performance, steals the show. Seymour is hopeless but not without hope; he's pathetic, stuck in a world that passed him by thirty years or so ago. His social skills are nearly nonexistent, and he spends his free time interacting with record aficionados, so he and Enid make quite the mismatched pair.\nAgain, though, if you don't buy into the character of Enid from the get-go - if, that is, you don't see anything redeemable in her to begin with - then the movie won't be the cult classic it should be. Juno, which came out seven years later, had a titular character who was just as snarky and all knowing but without the bitter, pathetic, hate-filled edge that Enid has here. Birch does what she can, and she can carry the picture when Buscemi's not on screen, but the mountain's too steep for her to climb.\n***"}

No one in his right mind would watch a Roland Emmerich movie for the plot. The man brought us Godzilla, Independence Day, and The Day after Tomorrow, after all. No, your focus here is supposed to be on the prehistoric-ness of the thing, like the wild, carnivorous birds, or the mastodons, or the sabre-tooth tigers. Oh, and the smoldering hotness of lurve that Our Hero and His Love can barely contain.\nYour first clue that this won\u2019t be much more than a silly bore is the simple fact that our noble hunters speak perfect, inflectionless English. No idea why. I\u2019m not the biggest fan of subtitles, granted, but I think here they at least would have made sense. Instead, we have these perfectly coiffed young people with gleaming white teeth - as any prehistoric hunter would have - speaking the Queen\u2019s English to each other. It\u2019s bizarre and off-putting. These cool kids look like they fell out of a Gap commercial; they\u2019d be dead in minutes if they actually had to fend for themselves on a tundra or in the jungle. They\u2019re as believable as Ed Begley, Jr. at a biker rally. Which is not very believable.\nAnd it\u2019s not as if they get clever, intelligent dialog to mouth. D\u2019Leh (heh, sounds like Delay) tells a vicious, trapped sabre-tooth tiger, \u201cDo not eat me when I set you free!\u201d See, because he doesn\u2019t want to be eaten, and he figures that reasoning with the beast will do the trick. D\u2019Leh, played by newcomer Steven Strait, is sort of a poor man\u2019s Colin Farrell, complete with otherworldly eyebrows. He wants you to think he\u2019s earnest and sincere, but instead you think he\u2019s vapid and vain. Crazy! (\u201dDo not eat me when I set you free!\u201d That\u2019s hilarious right there. Why, it\u2019s right up there with \u201cThrow me the whip, and I\u2019ll throw you the idol!\u201d) Besides, this whole pursuing-the-savages-who-stole-our-people thing was done much better only a few years ago in Mel Gibson\u2019s Apocalpyto. Now, you might not buy into the notion of using an ancient Mayan dialect in a movie, but at least it made some sense. Using that dialect, with subtitles, there was a real sense of adventure and tragedy; here, the fluid English feels woefully inept and completely anachronistic.\nUnlike Apocalypto, there\u2019s scant fighting and mayhem here. The tribe (like that in Apocalypto) is a hunting tribe, so that explains why for much of the movie they run and hide and duck and cover. I will find you! What\u2019s his name cries. And then he finds her and then loses her again, and he says, I\u2019ll come back! And then he spends the next hour or so trying to find her. His One True Love is like a set of pretty car keys.\nBack to that tiger, which makes a couple of appearances. Now, I like CGI as much as the next guy. It can very easily enhance a scene, make the unrealistic seem obvious and believable. But this tiger reminded me of the cyclops and other fantastical creatures you\u2019d see in those old fifties Greek-epic movies, the ones featuring the work of the great Ray Harryhausen - basically, essentially, stop-motion animation. And that looks crappy here in good ol\u2019 2008.\n10,000 BC isn\u2019t meant to be a historical epic - the year 10,000 BC is used here merely to connote a Long Time Ago - which is fine in and of itself, but really isn\u2019t anything compelling about it other than its setting. It\u2019s predictable pap without much of a heart, instilling no compassion or feeling from its audience."}
< {"rating": "6", "date": "20 July 2008", "title_id": "tt0468569", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "Ledger saves pretentious, overwrought superhero movie", "content": "Oddly enough, I don't go into a theater before watching a blockbuster movie with the expectation that it'll be over-hyped and bloated; that's just how it turns out from time to time. No, I have reasonable expectations just like the next guy.\nAs I check out the reactions to The Dark Knight, I notice a common thread - everyone likes the movie. Particularly, everyone seems enamored of Heath Ledger's unhinged, magnificent, and terrifying performance as The Joker. Straight out, I want to make clear that I completely agree. Ledger isn't just some ham acting out in a clown costume; we had Jack Nicholson do that already, nearly twenty years ago. Ledger commands the screen not with an over-the-top performance but a scene-stealing, subtle one. His makeup masks not only a despicable demon who hurts for the sake of causing pain but also a troubled, carefully shaded character worthy of Shakespeare's finest plays.\nLet's first get to what I didn't like. Many of the main roles are miscast, sometimes badly so. Christian Bale returns as the Caped Crusader, but if anything his performance is more wooden than in the movie's predecessor, Batman Begins. See, I've always thought the complex Batman character should be someone who's consumed by inner demons, one who even when unmasked reveals only some layers while hinting at much greater depths. And I never get that impression with Bale as Batman: He is what you see, and little more. Yes, we know he's got this secret identity thing going, and he doesn't tell people everything, and that's nice. Endearing, even. But Bale's inadequacies as an actor show up in spades here, because I never get the feeling that there's more than meets the eye. Bale's Batman doesn't feel like he's consumed by demons in the least; he seems like a pretty boy with a lot of money who likes to torture (yes, torture) and kill bad guys without any of the blame or acclaim.\nMoving along, we have a new Rachel Dawes, aka The Love Interest, played this time by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who's a monumental improvement over the wretched performance that Katie Holmes gave in Batman Begins. Even so, as has been noted elsewhere, Gyllenhaal is too intelligent, her eyes too ironically knowing, to play the role. She seems out of place, because she's smarter than Rachel Dawes - an assistant DA - is. (Of course, we don't see much of Rachel doing DA stuff; we see her running from place to place in a panic, or professing her love for Harvey Dent through nonverbal ways, or smiling coquettishly.) So: Like the Maggie Gyllenhaal, a LOT, but she was far better than her character was written. Someday they'll get it right.\nAnd then there's the third wheel to the love triangle: Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart. Now, you have to set aside Tommy Lee Jones's performance as Dent in one of the earlier Batman movies, because this is a new Bativerse, and it's like those other movies never happened. Dent eventually becomes the physically and mentally scarred Two-Face, but Eckhart can't quite handle the heavy lifting that the complicated character demands. When you see Eckhart, you think of likable cad, the slightly slimy guy who's better than the real hero at basically everything. But in a charming way. Here, Dent's a noble crusader, the district attorney who's going to clean up Gotham, but Eckhart is just another toothy, slick, Ken doll who's there just to look good. The way Eckhart plays Dent, you'd think he was just an affable fellow who wants to do the right thing; as with Bruce Wayne, there doesn't seem to be any undercurrent of ulterior motives, nothing to see here, please disperse. Eckhart, despite having studied split personalities in preparing for the role, is clearly in way over his head here.\nThe movie itself is overlong, even bloated. It seems the in thing nowadays to have a movie end several times - you know, to keep the Great Unwashed on their toes. Oh my goodness! It's not over yet! What will happen next? But surely there's a way to do this without producing a film that's two and a half hours long. If you're going to make a movie that long, be my guest, but the movie should be more than our heroes running from action scene to action scene, particularly when those action scenes are in dark, dank Gotham City.\nBut here are some positives, to make sure all bases are covered. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine exude effortless efficiency as Lucien and Alfred, respectively, doing far more for the movie than it for them. Both act as Bruce's conscience, and both roles were written as to be completely believable. Professionalism is always a plus when casting superhero movies. And some of those vaunted action scenes are a lot of fun to watch, although many of them seem to involve Batman jumping off a building, Batman climbing down the side of a building, or Batman throwing someone else off a building. In the dark. Because it's supposed to be gloomy ol' Gotham.\nSo for me, The Dark Knight was a disappointment. It's not a bad little film, but it felt too loose, as if writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan had decided on an ending and then threw everything they could think of into the plot to reach that goal. This happens to a lot of middling action films - the hero races to point A, escapes certain death, races to point B, escapes certain death, repeat ad infinitum. Same sort of thing here, only we don't even get clever plotting that we might expect from what's purportedly a higher grade of superhero movie. There's much chaos in The Dark Knight, but ultimately the maelstrom of disorder consumes, rather than engages, the viewer. Dark Night is elegy to the great potential - realized and unrealized - that's forever lost with the death of Heath Ledger."}

We didn't hear much about this redo of Journey to the Center of the Earth, not with so many other widely anticipated movies coming out this summer. And this version lives down to the lack of hype. It simply is what it is, which is a lazy way of saying it's amusing as long as you don't expect it to be, you know, terrifyingly awesome.\nFirst, a note on the 3D effects. Not all showings are in 3D, because 3D projectors are expensive. If you're unfortunate and can't find a 3D theater showing this, my advice is to skip it entirely - or perhaps watch it at home on your big-screen TV anyway. The truth is that once you strip away the effects, this is less Raiders of the Lost Ark (which it desperately wants to be) and more Alan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold (don't remember it? wonder why). It's like watching Sheena of the Jungle without the jiggle factor. It's got a main story thread - they must escape to the surface - and little else save for the great 3D effects. Another quick note: I don't know much about 3D technology, but I did notice that when an object was presented in 3D (say, a yo-yo darting toward the audience), everything else in the scene was in soft focus. I don't know if this is an artifact of the technology or if it was by design (i.e., diverting attention to solely the 3D), but it's not good that I noticed it.\nThe plot is straightforward. Fraser plays a Trevor, science teacher whose brother disappeared seven years earlier while researching tectonics. His widow drops off their son to Trevor so they can male bond, or something, and soon they're off adventuring, looking for clues to the brother/father's disappearance. They wind up in Iceland, where they figuratively hook up with a lovely mountain guide named Hannah (Anita Briem), whose father had been working with Trevor's brother. And off they go to check on a seismic reader on a remote mountaintop, when a freak lightning storm traps them in a cave, which leads down, down, down, and eventually they're at the center of the Earth.\nFraser has been gunning for these kind of roles for a while now, but here he's even less swarthy and manly than he was in the Mummy movies - he's more like Link, the caveman he played in Encino Man. Well, he's smart, and he's got courage, but Indy Jones he's not. In fact, he screws up so often early on that Hannah has to keep saving his life. That's gotta sting. So Fraser doesn't exactly fit the hero mold here, but what's more he can't show emotion properly. He either delivers his lines in a flat monotone or pushes the needle in the other direction and camps up a storm. I half expected him to look at the (nonexistent) sky and wail, \"WHYYYYYYYY?\" But certainly the big deal here is the effects, and many of them are especially awe inspiring. The movie lends itself rather well to 3D effects, what with the plummeting and the running and things flying at our heroes and stalking them and trying to stomp on them or eat them. It's good to see such creative use of 3D effects, because the better these outlying special movies are, the more likely we'll get to see more 3D in the future. It's expensive to make these, and theaters have to be specially equipped to show them, so unless there's a huge demand, there's no real reason for studios to make a lot of 3D movies.\nJourney to the Center of the Earth is based on the eponymous Jules Verne novel, and the novel itself figures prominently in the movie - pretty meta, huh? Yes, the book's probably better than the movie, so let's dispense with that, but even so, this isn't a bad adaptation. In fact, it's kind of clever in spots; Trevor's brother discovered, apparently, that the adventures and exciting places in Verne's book actually occurred and do exist, so Trevor, Hannah, and Sean (the nephew) can follow the book to see what perils await them. It's more of an homage to Verne's work than a ripoff of them, which is nice. Oh, and the movie even mentions Vernians, people who (in real life, not just this movie) do believe that Verne's novels are really nonfiction travelogues.\nWatch this movie in 3D, and you're sure to ooh and aah and OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS at various moments of impending doom. Journey to the Center of the Earth is imaginative, fun-packed, and a real treat; it's just that there's not much else there other than the effects, which somewhat blunts the appeal. Watch this movie in 2D, and it'll be just another two-bit B action movie with pithy one liners."}

It's imaginative, believable, and awe-inspiring, using stunning visual imagery to supplement tight, cohesive ensemble acting and a well-reasoned premise. Unlike such recent deep-space movies as Armageddon and Event Horizon, Sunshine shunts aside the characterizations of the crew members in favor of truly special effects and a sincere sense of dread and danger.\nFifty years in the future, the sun is dying. Oddly enough, this has nothing to do with either the sun's own aging process or the effect of human activity - it's a completely natural, if not wholly explainable, problem. So how do we Earthlings propose to solve this problem? By nuking the bejeezus out of the sun, thus reigniting it and restoring it to its literal and figurative splendor.\nSounds simple, right? Fly on out to the sun, drop a huge bomb (the mass of Long Island, New York), and zip on home. Piece of cake. Only the same mission was undertaken, and the crew from that spaceship was never heard from again. Now Icarus 2, armed with his megahuge bomb, must avoid the mistakes of Icarus 1, without knowing what befell their predecessors, much in the same way that Dr. Floyd and his crew traveled to Jupiter to find out what happened an earlier mission (Discovery); and what did they find? That Man was not meant to meddle in such affairs. (Cue maniacal laughter here.) One way in which Sunshine works is that the crew members are never portrayed as supermen; they're simply astronauts and scientists, and each of the actors is completely believable in the role. You'd almost expect this to be an all-American crew (it's not) with an American manly man as its commander (the captain is Japanese). But the personalities of the crew members are intentionally stunted so that the audience can focus on the mission. That is, the feeling of anxiety mixed with terror. We at home feel just as uncertain about the mission - if it fails, everyone on Earth dies - as the crew does.\nThe movie is exceptionally well cast, too. Cillian Murphy (Red Eye, 28 Days) is Capa, the ship's physicist; he's morose and pensive, and he's the only one who knows how to deploy the bomb (euphemistically called \"the payload\"). Michelle Yeoh (Tomorrow Never Dies, Memoirs of a Geisha) is Corazon, the ship's biologist; she's in charge of the oxygen garden (i.e., the greenhouse). Without the plants, there'd be no oxygen to live. Then there's engineer Mace, pilot Cassie, and psychologist Searle, to name a few others. Each performance is low key and empathic; you don't have characters suddenly going crazy in the depths of space, as happens in most other sci-fi movies of this stripe. Again, more focus on plot development than on preening psychoses.\nBut even so, there are conficts on board Icarus 2: Mace and Capa clearly don't like each other, but there's also a conflict that's a little reminiscent (derivative) of 2001. Without revealing anything crucial, I can explain that although the ship's computer does countermand a direct human order, such obstinance is not due to conflicting orders. So you can rest easy that this isn't a ripoff of Clarke's masterpiece.\nDirector Danny Boyle and cinematographer Alwin H. Kuchler succeed in presenting a jaw-dropping array of sun-ripened majesty. Not to put too fine of a point on it, but they allow the viewer to get a sense of the overwhelming mass and brilliance of the sun without the need for the suspension of disbelief. For example, the Icarus 2 has an observation room from which crew can view the sun head on - through strong, strong filters. Even with those filters on, Dr. Searle experiences a bath of light that envelops him both physically and mentally - he's never quite the same after observing the sun, and his exposure informs his character for the rest of the movie.\nNow, although the movie had a science consultant advising them on the practical aspects of the ship's mission, there IS some suspension of disbelief. For example - a bomb with the mass of Long Island? Into the sun? Come on, that won't be more than a raindrop in the Pacific. And how can the ship be so strong and resistant to heat that it can get close enough to deploy the payload? Wouldn't it just burn up? As with the best sci-fi, Sunshine asks more questions than it answers (not including the rhetorical ones I just asked). It teeters on the edge of classic science fiction but ultimately waits patiently on the plateau - or asteroid, if you will - of a near-classic. It's shiny, it's pretty, and it's thoughtful, but it's mystical ending might seem a little like a cop out to some."}

Do you automatically think goblins are awesome?", "content": "You know you're in for a treat when a main character defiantly says, \"We must protect the house!\" and then the next thirty minutes are spent beating the holy crap out of the house.\nThe Spiderwick Chronicles, based on a series of children's fantasy books, will never be confused with its cleverer brethren, like the Harry Potter or Golden Compass books and movies. The movie is likable enough, with two appealing performances by Freddie Highmore (playing twins of different dispositions, of course), but it's steadfastly stupid in some parts and offers only stereotypically cardboard characterizations.\nThe Grace family - mom, older sister, twin brothers - have relocated from New York to the rural Spiderwick estate. Mom's separating from dad, and not everyone in the family's taking it too well - Jared, the troublemaking teen, is sullen, disinterested, and angry. So right from the get-go we get plenty of interfamily dynamics that we'd just as soon do without - mom yelling at kids, sister Mallory smacking Jared around, bookish-twin Simon meekly accepting his role as doormat, that sort of thing. Everyone's sort of obnoxious. Which is kind of what you expect from a book about British kids, like the Narnia movies.\nAt any rate, the defiant Jared stumbles upon a book written by his great-grandfather Arthur Spiderwick, a book that details the amazing - and dangerous - world right under their collective noses, surrounding the creepy and mysterious Victorian mansion they've moved into (Spiderwick's house). All of the secrets of these hidden worlds are contained in this book, it turns out, which begs the question of why it was written, since much of the movie involves people trying to get it and rule the world, or something.\nWhen Jaren shows his find to his family, naturally no one believes him, not even his twin brother. This is because in movies, the Bad Kid must never be believed about anything, and everything is immediately his fault, no matter how outlandish. Merely opening the book causes bad things to happen in the Grace house, including the sudden growth of Mallory's hair, which ties itself to her bedpost. Yep, gotta be her brother's fault.\nAnd as in many other movies, first no one believes Jared, then one, then two, then Mom herself - but only when evidence is staring them in the face. The lesson here, to the little kids watching the movie, is that one should be careful what one says to one's elders, because no one's gonna believe you. Cute, huh? Turns out that Spiderwick was borne away by sylphs (fairies), and his little daughter Lucy pined away for years awaiting his return - only to be committed to a sanitarium. Oh, but she left a legacy in the house, which is stocked with lots of salt, tomato sauce, and honey, all to help and combat these fantastical creatures. There's even a wide circle around the house that protects it and its inhabitants from danger.\nWhich of course brings me to a particularly dumb aspect of the story, one that I can mention here. Inevitably, those creatures that desire the book launch an attack on the house. Jared and his family know the attack's coming, and they prepare. But no one thinks of expanding the circle! Geez, they have hours to figure this stuff out, and if they took all that salt they have in the house and widened the circle, they would have bought plenty of time. Man, given enough time, they could have put the circle around the goblins' lair! This is a rare fantasy story that pays barely any attention to its own mythological elements, which are really the bread and butter of any fantasy tale. Instead the focus is more on the family dynamic, and how no one believes anyone. And plus, cmon - the older sister just happens to be a world-class fencer? In one scene, she practices with good-twin Simon - and you'll note that neither of them are wearing any padding or equipment, and the sword is sharp, not blunt. I'm no fencing expert, but I'm pretty sure that's not how it's supposed to work, especially if you're a teenager.\nI can appreciate how the mom (Mary-Louise Parker) is trying hard to keep her kids together after having left her husband - and Jared doesn't make it easy for her - but she's so prone to jump to conclusions that my sympathy for her quickly dissipated.\nAnd lucky Freddie Highmore! You know you've hit it big when you get to play twins. And in keeping with tradition, the twins are nothing alike. He follows in the footsteps of the legendary Jean-Claude Van Damme here, as well as most soap-opera stars. Although it's a movie that seems like it should be about the Grace kids, Jared is front and center, as timid Simon is shunted aside almost entirely.\nThe Spiderwick Chronicles is probably best for those less-discerning single-digit munchkins; anyone over six will be bored, and there aren't enough jokes to sustain anyone else's interest."}

The animation isn't bad, it's just that unlike the undersea world in Finding Memo or the toy chest in Toy Story, there's just nothing pretty to look at for large chunks of time. And because the main characters are robots who don't exactly speak English well, the movie depends rather heavily on two things: the visual landscape and the nonlinguistic communication of the metal duo. As a result, the movie isn't quite as charming or self-effacing as its predecessors, but it's still amiable and heartwarming when it needs to be.\nWALL-E is the last remaining robot on Earth. See, the place got so polluted that everyone had to zoom off to ships in outer space just to survive; the plan is to let the WALL-E units compact and store all the garbage, and when life can be sustainable again, the humans will return. This was 700 years ago. And every day, WALL-E compacts trash (all the other units have broken down), blissfully un-self-aware. The humans send down probes to determine if life can return to the planet, and that's when our WALL-E meets EVE, who's quite a bit more advanced and intelligent than WALL-E.\nWALL-E is adorable. He looks quite a bit like Johnny 5 from the Short Circuit films, and he's about as smart and curious. As he collects and compacts trash, he grabs various items that seem interesting to him and stores them in his storage crate. But although he's been at it for centuries, his world's turned upside down when Eve the probe arrives on Earth in search of plant life. Wouldn't you know it, our inquisitive little toaster falls in love at first sight with the sleek Eve, who looks sort of like a giant toe (her visor would be the toe nail - try to stay with me on this).\nOn Earth, although the atmosphere is lighthearted and full of hope, the scenery (and hence the overall look and feel of the movie) is downbeat and gloomy; everything's washed out in a sea of brown and gray. The planet's a wasteland, you see, along the lines of the postapocalyptic horror of Mad Max.\nBut once we leave the planet and land on the ship Avion, things perk up. Here, everything's red or blue (the colors in the BuyNLarge logo - that's the conglomerate that owned, like, everything on the planet and that now owns and operates the deep-space ships. You should see these places - the whole idea is that the humans will never have to lift a finger. Robots wake them up. They're dumped onto these motorized recliners that whisk them everywhere. They shop and drink milkshakes from their recliners. They literally never move. So of course they're all tremendously overweight.\nCan WALL-E and Eve help bring life back to Earth? It's a Disney/Pixar film, so you probably already know the answer, and if you thought about it for a second, you could probably map out how the movie would shake out. But one thing you might not realize is that for a G-rated movie, there's a lot of tense, scary-toned scenes. There are several moments when you're led to believe something incredibly awful has happened to WALL-E, and unlike in its cartoon progenitors there's a perceptible delay before it's revealed he's okay - long enough for you to wonder if, indeed, he is.\nSo I was a little surprised to find out this was a G-rated movie. Aside from the desolate, acrid, lifeless landscape of Earth, there are plenty of robot-in-peril scenes, sequences that seem more action-movie-like than cartoonish. This is partly because Pixar's animation is so advanced now that WALL-E looks and behaves exactly as you'd expect a robot in real life would. Which brought me to this question: Why even make an animated movie about robots? It's not as if you're giving human qualities to, say, a fish or a stuffed animal; you're anthropomorphizing something that's already been given human qualities.\nIn short, WALL-E lacked the amazing, imaginative premise and theme that earlier classics had. I wasn't bowled over by the animation, and I just wasn't terribly impressed with the execution. WALL-E is not a bad movie by any means, but it suffers by comparison with its own ancestors. In the end, it's done in by its subject matter (not conducive to gorgeous animation), its setting (vast, colorless), and its penchant for robot-in-peril scenes."}

Chris McCandless' journey is a gripping travelogue that's both a cautionary tale and a vicariously exhilarating experience; man, it looked like he had a whale of a good time, but man, did it end badly for him.\nFirst and foremost, what makes Into the Wild work so flawlessly is that even knowing the final outcome doesn't change the overall effect that movie will have on the average moviegoer. Based on McCandless' real story, the movie pulls few punches in how the protagonist is depicted; he's neither a saint nor a sinner, just an idealistic (and not naive), troubled college graduate who feels adrift from literally everything: parents, life, friends.\nChris (Emile Hirsch) is a highly intelligent Emory College grad, the son of a NASA scientist (William Hurt) and an entrepreneur (Marcia Gay Harden). But unlike other privileged young citizens, Chris has no intentions of enjoying the gifts and wealth his family and connections have afforded him. Instead, he gives away his life savings of $24,000, abandons his beat-up Datsun, leaves his family behind (without telling them), and sets of on a trek around the country.\nChris's travels take him literally all over the country, across the midwest (where he runs a grain harvester for Vince Vaughn), to the Rocky Mountains, to the Grand Canyon, the Hoover Dam, Las Vegas, even down to Mexico, winding up at his ultimate resting spot: deepest, darkest, remotest Alaska. The story is told in two timelines, one of the present (the time shortly before and after Chris discovers an abandoned bus in the Alaskan wilderness), and one of the past, the events leading up to Chris's Magic Bus time. And the two timelines are brilliantly juxtaposed with each other by director Sean Penn, who doesn't just show us a perfectly linear chronology of how Chris came to be in an abandoned bus; he shows us the story behind the adventurer, the believer, the angel, the tactiturn rebel, the iconoclast.\nSo what made Chris McCandeless decide to ditch everything and live off the land like some latter-day flower child? I'll explain no further than to say that his upbringing, under the commanding, demanding eyes of his overachieving, arguing parents, played a huge role - but perhaps not the only role. In short, Chris decides he simply does not wish to be part of the rat race; he does not wish to be trapped in a meaningless job working for a meaningless company doing trite, soul-destroying things. He wants to live and learn on his own. And that's where the inspirational aspect of this kicks in. He sets out to accomplish something undefined (i.e., the abstract Find Himself) and winds up absorbing more knowledge through his experiences than most people do through their lonely lives of quiet desperation.\nAlong the way, Chris meets myriad people, and it's genuinely touching how much of an impact he has on their lives as he passes through. In particular, Catherine Keener plays an aging hippie whose love for her soul mate (Brian Dierker) has begun to fade; the mere presence of the Christ-like Chris magically changes that, for the better. (A lesser film might have had Chris and Jan sleeping together to foment complications in everyone's relationship.) Chris tells everyone he meets that his ultimate goal is to live in the Alaskan wilderness, consequences be damned; everyone tells him not to do it.\nThe impression we're finally left with of Christopher McCandless is that of a clever, thoughtful, engaging young man who had more demons than a nightmare of Clive Barker dopplegangers. Haunted by his own harrowing childhood, he escaped as literally and figuratively as he could, living by the seat of his pants over thousands of miles of gravel, sand, and asphalt. His motives might have been a bit selfish (he never did try to contact his family, the film tells us), but his heart seemed to be in the right place otherwise. Which made his demise all the harder to bear.\nHal Holbrook, playing a crusty benefactor to Chris in the Arizona desert, earned an Oscar nomination, and it's well deserved, but even stronger accolades are due to Hirsch, who underwent tremendous physical changes just to play Chris McCandless properly. And the final scene, the waning moments of Chris's life, is so vivid and packed with emotion that you almost can't bear to watch, peeking instead through crossed fingers. Hirsch is so excellent in the role that it's a travesty of some magnitude that he wasn't more widely recognized for his grueling, gutty performance. Even more so when you realize the guy later played Speed Racer and previously had been best known for being Judd Hirsch's kid."}
< {"rating": "6", "date": "17 June 2008", "title_id": "tt0408236", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "Stylish, if a little too musical", "content": "I think the biggest problem I have with Sweeney Todd is with the concept itself, that of a horror musical. There's something just weirdly incongruous about people singing about killing and cannibalism, you know? Maybe it's just me; I like musicals, and I like horror movies, but I don't know if the twain should meet.\nThat said, the time-honored premise of Sweeney Todd is diabolically gruesome, and I mean that in the most positive way. Todd is the former Benjamin Barker, a barber who's been exiled from nineteenth-century London by a corrupt judge, who then swooped in and took Barker's wife from him for good measure. Fifteen years later, Barker, now known as Todd, returns to the city, but his wife Lucy, raped and driven mad by the judge (Alan Rickman) has killed herself, and Todd's daughter Johanna is the judge's ward.\nTodd opens a barber shop above a bakery owned by a Mrs. Lovett, who's soon encouraging Todd to exact his revenge. They hatch the perfect plan: She needs meat, he needs revenge, so they work in concert, since Todd's moral compass has spun off its magnetic axis. Everyone wins! The movie was directed by Tim Burton, and his imprint is noticeable right from the start, with a rivulet of blood coursing through well-worn machine gears over the title cards. When you think of Tim Burton, you think of stylish, don't you, not placid, or heavily plot driven, or over-the-top action. You think of the visual images, the freewheeling, indelibly intriguing imagination that brought you Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, and the Corpse Bride. Here, Burton is incredibly successful; the set pieces are magnificent, as is his use of color. When Todd slashes a throat, vibrant reds attack the screen in stark contrast to the staid, mostly black backgrounds (and the pallid complexions of the Londoners, of course).\nPrior to the film's release, there was more than a little bit of nervousness about the casting of Johnny Depp, a longtime Burton collaborator. This was to be an adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim stage presentation, a version of the old tale that - surprise - required actual singing. Could Johnny Depp lend enough gravitas to the dark role of Sweeney Todd? Sure, as far as actual acting went, but could he even carry a tune? Turns out he can, although I wouldn't sign him to any recording contracts. He's an okay singer; let's leave it at that. But he's fantastic, naturally, as the demonic barber - who, let's be frank, looks like Edward Scissorhands' dad or perverted uncle.\nAlso proving to be a decent singer was Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett. I don't know what it is about Bonham Carter, but she almost always looks like she's playing a strung-out crack addict. Must be the saucer eyes and the paleness. At any rate, she's a real treat, as usual, as the wicked, duplicitous Gothic baker of unique meat pies.\nThe movie is 116 minutes long, but if you cut out the musical numbers you'd be left with perhaps 45 minutes. True, many plot points are expressed via song, but it's not long before those songs feel forced, inauthentic, and superfluous. Granted, the songs themselves are thematically downbeat, not of the happy-joy variety, and granted, they're there to move the plot along, rather than inhibit it, but therein lay a problem. When the actors sang, they sang loudly. When they were merely speaking, they spoke softly. And this wasn't like 1940s musicals, where the songs are telegraphed ahead of time; the actors would go from talking to SINGING to talking to SINGING and I spent much of those 116 minutes adjusting the volume. Seriously - the dialog is so softly spoken it's very difficult to hear, even if the sound's turned up, and what's more, the characters all have nearly unintelligible (to me) Cockney accents that drop vowels, consonants, punctuation, you name it. I needed subtitles.\nSo although the movie didn't quite do it for me, I can appreciate what it was trying to accomplish. Indeed, judging from the many accolades it received, it was quite successful. If you're looking for an ultraviolent horror show filled with singing, you will not be disappointed, although I can't imagine there'd be much competition for that dubious honor."}

And when I say they're in bed together, I mean they are engaging in coitus together. And graphically so. This might throw you if you were expecting a musky, dark-hued film noir about a heist gone wrong, especially when you see the position the lovely Tomei and the obese Hoffman are in.\nBut don't get your hopes up, nerdy horny males, because that's about all the titillation you'll get from this movie. Not that the rest of it is all unicorns and EZ Bake Ovens; there's drug use, there's profanity, there's blood, there's murder. Fun stuff for the entire family, really. People talk and act in disgusting, depraved manners; there are no heroes, no good guys in this movie.\nYou see, Andy, despite having a high-paying job, is in some financial straits (something he'd rather Gina not know), so he cooks up a scheme: He and ne'er-do-well brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) will rob their parents' small jewelry store and fence the stones for the needed cash. The store's insured, Andy reasons, so mom and dad will be fine, and the only person in the store in the mornings is an older woman. In an homage to Rashomon, we get to see the attempted heist as it plays out, and then we see the circumstances leading up to the failure.\nThings don't so much spiral out of control for Hank and Andy as simply collapse around them. No matter what machinations Andy employs to alleviate the consequences of their misdeeds, the brothers - and the rest of the family - are inextricably intertwined, both with themselves and with each other. Their dilemmas are a veritable Chinese Finger Trap, or maybe a roach motel. There's nothing they can do but bind themselves tighter than ever.\nThe movie is brilliantly told, which isn't easy when you're dealing with a lot of plot. There are threads begetting threads and so forth, and everything comes back to everything else, which is sweet and sour at the same time. The trouble with plot is simply that the onus is on the script to make things work - you can't have holes, because everyone will notice them. You can have holes in a Die Hard plot, because no one cares about them. See how it works? So it's crucial that the plot is sensible, exciting, and unpredictable, and writer Kelly Masterson succeeds on all three plots. (Can you believe this was a debut screenplay?) Adding to the intrigue was the pitch-perfect score, by Carter Burwell (No Country for Old Men).\nThis is one of those movies where you already know the bad guys from the get go. What you don't know is why they're bad guys. What drove them to do this? How did their plan fail? And what will happen to them in the end? In the old days, the bad guys never even got away - sometimes they gave the money back, or went to jail, anything upbeat. Then came Bonnie and Clyde, which ended in blood. But will the bad guys here simply escape on a plane to Brazil? Will they be mowed down in a majestic blaze of glory? Will they turn themselves in? Now, the possibilities seem infinite.\nThe cast is superlative, and I can't think of good reasons why the movie wasn't Oscar nominated. Hoffman is treacherous and vulnerable as the wily Andy; Hawke is a whiny, mewling nebbish by contrast. So both actors played against type, really. Albert Finney plays the boys' father Charles, and he's as good as Albert Finney usually is. (Although would someone please tell Mr. Finney to close his mouth on occasion? He's gonna catch flies that way.) But to me, the best performance was in one of the lesser roles: Tomei. Say what you will about Tomei's Oscar for My Cousin Vinny, the lady is extremely talented. She's as beautiful and alluring as she was in 1992 (Vinny) and 2001 (In the Bedroom, another nomination), and her Gina is terrified and strong to a fault, cowed by the riches her husband's job has afforded them and pining for happier times, trapped in a moribund marriage.\nAnd do you know who directed this masterpiece? Sidney Lumet. Sidney Lumet's so old, he directed 12 Angry Men fifty years ago. And now look at him! This movie feels like it was directed by a young, hungry director with a lot to prove. It's snappy, it's growly, it wants you to look at the protagonists and see not how wretched they become as a result of this robbery but how wretched they were all along. These are the people in your neighborhood, says Lumet's masterful work."}

With a whimsical, winning performance by John C. Reilly, Judd Apatow's mock tribute to hard and fast livin' rockers is a knowing smackdown (albeit gently) of the tried-and-true, rags-to-riches Horatio Alger story. Hey, they mock because they love.\nDewey Cox (Reilly) grows up in the Deep South, and owing to a family tragedy (not unlike Cash's, only much, much funnier), finds himself with a paw who doesn't believe in him (and, uh, no brother). So off to cut a record with his bandmates, played by Chris Parnell, Tim Meadows, and Matt Besser. (Meadows' character in particular is a hoot, always getting hooked on the next big drug). And then get married and father five or so kids. And then fall in love with a backup singer named Darlene (Jenna Fischer, who's a complete doppleganger for Amy Adams, I swear), who he naturally marries. While still married to the first one. And so on.\nHe even meets Elvis (poorly impersonated by Jack White of the White Stripes), The Big Bopper, and even Buddy Holly (an improbable Frankie Muniz). Oh, and he goes to India to rap with the Maharishi along with the Beatles, who are played by four recognizable names - but they're so unrecognizable that they need to refer to each other (along with Dewey) by their full names. (Seriously. The impressions are so bad that they sound like they were written by someone who'd merely heard mention of the Fab Four at some point and never read anything about them.) There's plenty of drug references and some nudity, but what I like most are the running jokes. As with the Cash flick, Dewey destroys a sink when he gets upset. Okay, make that six sinks. And he steps in as a last-minute replacement for an established act - in an all-black exotic club. Imagine a good ol' boy on a stage, cracking wise to rowdy black folk, and then he steps right into a race-laced tune! Reilly himself sings a lot of the songs (he even co-wrote some of them), and the man has some singing chops (remember Chicago?). He really has to, in order for the film to work at all. Sure, it's a comedy, but a movie about a bad musician isn't entertaining - kind of like a movie about a bad comedian. Such a movie would be funny in parts, but whenever the performer was on the stage, you'd just cringe and hope for the best. So Reilly, as Dewey, has to be spot on, and he is.\nDespite a slowish first half, this is what you'd call an agreeable waste of time. The closing musical sequence (it's set at an all-star tribute to Dewey) is a real knockout - as it should be. It's reminiscent of the 35th Anniversary special staged to honor Bob Dylan back in the 90s, with various acts covering Cox's best (Jewel, Eddie Vedder, Jackson Browne, and Ghostface Killah all appear). But the final number, a solo by Cox, is a real heart - and show - stopper, and this more than makes up for the sluggish (even by the numbers, as far as parodies go) start."}

If you buy into this premise, then this is a unique, thoughtful perspective of an almost-unknowable individual, a man who famously played things close to the vest, a man who shunned introspection. But if you don\u2019t immediately buy into this premise, then the movie just feels like a long experiment that isn\u2019t entirely successful, and in the end you don\u2019t feel you know much more about the man, the myth, the legend than you knew going in. Which might be the point, who\u2019s to say? And that\u2019s sort of where I land on the whole I\u2019m Not There. issue.\nHere\u2019s one big problem right off the bat. The six various characters, each representing part of Dylan, have different names. Some of them are named after real-life people, like Woody Guthrie and Arthur Rimbaud. Some have fictitious names, like Jude Quinn (an amalgam of Jude from \u201cHey Jude\u201d and Dylan\u2019s own \u201cThe Mighty Quinn\u201d), Jack Rollins, and Robbie Clark - the latter being an actor playing one of the aspects in a movie. And then it gets confusing.\nThe first gimmick for this movie is that each aspect is played by an actor you wouldn\u2019t expect to see playing Dylan. Okay, maybe not all of them, but some of them. Cate Blanchett is one. She\u2019s female, in case you were unsure, and she is by far the best Dylan in the movie. She plays Jude, the latter-day, peeved-at-everyone Dylan. Another is Marcus Carl Franklin, who plays \u201cWoody Guthrie\u201d - here, a young version of Dylan, riding the rails across the Midwest. Franklin is African American. Then there\u2019s Heath Ledger and Christian Bale, who are Australian (as is Blanchett) and Welsh, respectively. The problem with those, though, is that the only difference between them and the real Dylan is Dylan\u2019s particular linguistic tendencies, so you wind up with just some guys acting Dylanesque. You know, the perpetual cigarette dangling precariously, the hat, the whole nine yards.\nIt would have been more effective, for me, if each of the aspects was played by completely different looking people - because in order for them to be identifiable as Dylan, they would have to sound like him. Otherwise you\u2019re left with some folk-singing iconoclast who\u2019s rebelling against everyone, and you don\u2019t know why. So there\u2019s one issue. And that would have been a clever, but not too-clever, way for each supposed aspect or time period to be represented. Even if two aspects were on the screen simultaneously, big deal - at least we could tell who was who.\nBut added to this gimmick is the fact that some non-Dylan characters - and some situations - are based on real-life people, like Allen Ginsburg, and retain their counterparts\u2019 names, and others are clearly supposed to be real people but have \u2026 different names. And some situations definitely did occur (such as Dylan\u2019s getting booed at the Newport festival, a huge turning point for him), but did all of them? Were any of them made up to highlight that particular aspect of his personality? One of the characters is Arthur Rimbaud. No, not the poet, he just has that name. Anyway, the entirety of his screen time is spent giving testimony or something to officials (or a jury, I\u2019m not sure). And his speeches are of the deep philosophical sort, the kind that Dylan was apparently fond of - ways to get into people\u2019s minds, but I\u2019m not sure what the soliloquies add in terms of exposition and revelation.\nThen there\u2019s also Richard Gere, who plays Billy the Kid, another \u201caspect\u201d of Dylan. Apparently here Billy is mythologized as this hiding loner at the end of his career, just sort of like Dylan, only Dylan\u2019s not even now at the end of his career, unless he keels over tomorrow, or something. Gere\u2019s good, and I don\u2019t say that often, but I think the aspect, such as it is, is too abstract and unreadable to be worthwhile.\nThe intermittent narrator (Kris Kristofferson) is marginally helpful; perhaps he could have been used to tie all these aspects together. Instead we get two hours of ego feeding and idol worship. To me, though, it felt more like idle worship than anything else, a waste of time even if you\u2019re willing to grasp whatever deep insights the film pretends to offer to you."}

Harrison Ford, looking every one of his 65 years (but that\u2019s okay - because that\u2019s how old Dr. Jones is, too), is really terrific as the intrepid professor/archaeologist; it looks like he\u2019s hardly been away from the role he last played in 1989. And his supporting cast is also top-notch, with one notable exception.\nThe year is 1957, and as the movie opens a Russian commando has infiltrated a US base in New Mexico. Seems the Russkies - led by Cate Blanchett, in a cold, despicably evil performance - are looking for a certain crystal skull that can commute the usual incredible powers to whoever returns it to its rightful place. Of course, Jones quickly is involved, and his travels take him to the jungles of Peru (somewhat surprisingly, cocaine trafficking is not even mentioned as a plot device). Oh, but not before paying homage to a relic of the late 1950s, atomic-bomb testing. Yes, it\u2019s Indy Jones in the Atomic Age! Unfortunately, we don\u2019t get a sudden fifty-foot Dr. Jones with one eye.\nIndy\u2019s not alone, naturally, that would be boring. Gone is Marcus Brody, since Denholm Elliott died in 1992, and Henry Jones Sr., since Sean Connery is retired from acting. Indiana has with him his partner Mac (Ray Winstone) and a new friend, a greaser (remember, 1957) named Mutt who insists his mom told him to find Jones, and since he hasn\u2019t heard from his mom, who was looking for another friend, Dr. Oxley (John Hurt), Mutt believes he and Indy have to team up to find out what\u2019s going on.\nFirst, let\u2019s look at Ford. There are few actors who have had the monumental pop-cultural impact that Ford\u2019s had. He\u2019s been Han Solo, Jack Ryan, and Indiana Jones. He\u2019s been in nine movies with just those three characters, and his movies have made billions - and yet the man himself has exactly one Oscar nomination (for Working Girl). His wry looks and grim determination haven\u2019t faded much over the years, and he makes this role work simply because you can believe Indy would look just like that after two decades have passed. Ford knows what makes for effective acting; you want your audience to completely buy into everything your character does, as if they were in your character\u2019s shoes. And one thing that the Indiana Jones films do that other action films don\u2019t is that they eschew most action-guy bon mots and stunts that stretch plausibility past its breaking point. And remember, Harrison Ford does most of his own stunts, too.\nHis supporting cast gels quite nicely, all things considered. Karen Allen returns as Marion Ravenwood, whom we haven\u2019t seen since the original Raiders of the Lost Ark. Allen\u2019s been out of work for four years now and didn\u2019t have much of a career even after RotLA, but she looked good here, and more importantly she had excellent chemistry with Ford. Winstone and Hurt, both fine actors, are pretty good here as well - although Winstone\u2019s rough British accent is indecipherable at times, and Hurt\u2019s character has very little to say (he\u2019s mad, you see) until very late in the film.\nPerplexing is the decision to cast Shia LaBeouf has bad-boy Mutt Williams, though. LaBeouf was entertaining in Transformers, but he has the face of an innocent little lamb, not Vinne Barbarino. So more like Arnold Horshack. He can\u2019t act tough; he can barely imagine tough. LaBeouf looks like he\u2019s trying to play dress up at a particularly lame Halloween party, but then our luck changes; in South America, he\u2019s suddenly Awesome Lad, able to help Old Man Jones fight off those nasty Reds.\nAny fan of the series will recognize some running gags - Indy\u2019s fear of snakes, for one thing. And a fight at the edge of a cliff! And Indy getting interrupted while lecturing to his class, by the school\u2019s new dean (Jim Broadbent)! There\u2019s even a nod to Indy\u2019s insistence that old stuff belongs in a museum, as Blanchett\u2019s evil minx Irina Spalko tries to entice the unwavering scientist with visions of gifts to museums. She\u2019s quite touching, that Irina.\nIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is far brighter and flat-out fun than 1984\u2019s Temple of Doom, and it\u2019s more actiony and dramatic than 1989\u2019s Last Crusade; the only movie to which it pales in comparison is the original, and there\u2019s nothing Steven Spielberg, Harrison Ford, or George Lucas could do to prevent that. The fourth installment is genuine adventure, complete with a cohesive cast and some jaw-dropping action sequences.\nSo there you have it. Not pedestrian, not lame, not boring. Quite good, really. An outstanding effort that\u2019s (as usual) best appreciated on the big screen, although with so many large-screen TVs about nowadays, watching at home should be just as intense."}

It's difficult to watch, sort of like 1998's Affliction only without the grizzled crankiness of Nick Nolte to soften the grim viewpoint.\nWendy Savage (Linney) is 39 years old and works various temp jobs as she struggles to gain footing as a playwright; older brother Jon (Hoffman) is a philosophy professor. Neither has been close to their father in many years, so when Wendy gets a call from the Arizona desert that Lenny (Philip Bosco) has been smearing his own feces onto walls, they have to hustle out west. Where, of course, they find out that Dear Old Dad's longtime girlfriend has just keeled over, leaving him homeless.\nIf you're at that age where you've figured out that your parents aren't gonna live forever, the next reel of the movie is both poignant and grueling, although it's also a bit vicious and unsettling. Wendy and Jon have to find a place for Lenny to live, and he's obviously showing early signs of dementia. One of their escapades involves a transcontinental flight, just Wendy and Lenny. Hilarity ensues, just the wry, perhaps-familiar kind. Lenny drifts in and out of reality, sometimes conflating his life with those of movie characters. Sometimes he thinks he's in a hotel, and sometimes he doesn't recognize his kids. Oh, and the siblings! There's a tiny bit of resentment and bitterness there, you see. Jon is successful; Wendy is not. Wendy has feelings of inadequacy around her brother, and both of them were (verbally) abused and then abandoned by their father long ago. So there's a strong undercurrent of raging subtext in this journey into hopelessness.\nSo the story isn't so much about the two grown-up kids dealing with the incapacitation of their father as it is about sibling rivalry and dealing with long-forgotten slights and neuroses they didn't realize they had. Adding to the complexities is an affair that Wendy is having with a married man (she even gets to trot out the \"I'm not married, but my boyfriend is\" witticism). Then there's a cloying bit about an old dog, and a feisty cat ... and let's just say that the most exciting part is when Lenny's smearing feces on the wall in the first scenes of the movie.\nNothing against either Linney (who was nominated for an Oscar here) or Hoffman, because they both gave more to the picture than it gave to them. Without their effort here, the movie would have been even muddier and depressing. But unless it strikes you in the right mood - perhaps introspective, perhaps schadenfreude - you could find yourself weighed with self-doubt and self-pity, grasping at threads of your life that you thought had long vanished."}

The movie isn't just juvenile, uncreative, and pathetic; it's sort of a clinic on how to suck as a movie. It's extremely predictable, which would be fine if the jokes and raunch were any interesting. It's also viciously mean spirited - and not in the broad, over-the-top blunt (no pun intended) humor of the 2004 original, either. Back then, everything that the titular duo did was wrapped in a drug-induced haze, and that justified the lowbrow comedy. Hey, it's funny because they're stoned, man! Get it? But not so with this one. Sure, drug use figures prominently into the plot, but there aren't nearly enough drug scenes to save the movie. Harold and Kumar do things that can be obliquely traced to drug use, you see, but most of their problems come from their unimpaired decision making, and that makes for a dull, pointless film.\nOriginally, this was titled \"Harold and Kumar Go to Amsterdam,\" but eventually the filmmakers figured out that our buds (no pun intended, I swear) don't actually make it to Amsterdam. As the trailer showed, they're mistaken for terraists and are deposited in Guantanamo Bay. Well, the prison, not the actual bay. And then, as you might have been able to predict, they escape. Wild shenanigans follow, including a visit to a \"bottomless\" party (which was clever), a run in with nonstereotypical denizens in Alabama (not bad), an encounter with a stereotypical inbred hillbilly couple (including that \"Hemi\" guy from those old Dodge commercials), and a mixup with a Klan gathering. The latter was funny back when Chevy Chase did it in Fletch Lives, and no so much now.\nAnd of course there's the obligatory appearance by Neil Patrick Harris as himself. His was a huge boon to the original movie, and he's back, fortuitously showing up to save the lads from the Klansmen. And that's about the only time that the movie has any spark at all; Harris wolfs down mushrooms while driving to a whorehouse, and at one point he sees a unicorn. It's the exact kind of trippy awesomeness that helped make the original movie a cult hit, and there's so little of it here.\nAside from that, the movie's pedestrian. Kumar wants to get to Texas and, in a staple of generic teen comedies, break up the wedding of his ex-girlfriend to the world's biggest douchebag - no offense to you other douchebags out there. Adding a complication we would NEVER have foreseen, he's also the One Guy who can get Harold and Kumar out of the mess they're in. And Harold wants to get to Amsterdam (eventually) to meet up with the girl he met at the end of the first movie (she's there on business; won't she be surprised? If so, it would be the only surprise in the movie.) At its heart, the movie's problem is that Kal Penn and John Cho don't have nearly the degree of on-screen chemistry that they had in the first movie, for whatever reason. The two kids from Superbad covered similar ground, and they were infinitely more believable and funnier. Harold and Kumar are bitter jerks to each other at various points in the story, and it's not the wild exaggerated-for-comic-effect kind of bitterness, either, which makes it a little uncomfortable to watch at times. Quite a disappointment.\nConstipating the humor even further was a howlingly awful performance by Rob Corddry as some deputy Homeland Security canker sore who's out to get Harold and Kumar. There's broad performance, and there's one-note. Corddry can be funny with a good script to follow, but if the writing's terrible, so is he. What should have been hyperbolically funny was instead discomfiting and annoying, huge debits for such a big role.\nI want my $10 back, to paraphrase the delivery boy in Better Off Dead. Harold and Kumar Escape from Gunatanamo Bay is a rip off, best enjoyed (if that) at home, ironically, with many friends who pay you to see it. Which would be illegal, I think, so don't do it."}

There, a nice run-on sentence to start things off. And a sentence fragment.\nMichael (Clooney) is a high-powered law firm\u2019s fixer, i.e, the guy who solves the myriad problems that the firm\u2019s clients and partners encounter on a daily basis. He knows people who know people, see? He\u2019s got people to make your issues go away. Clayton\u2019s sent by his boss Marty (Sydney Pollack) to Milwaukee, where Arthur Edens (Wilkinson) has just freaked out. Arthur has been working on a huge case for sixteen years, one involving a class-action suit against a weed-killer manufacturer. (Arthur\u2019s on the defendant\u2019s side.) In the middle of a deposition being given by one of the victims, Arthur suddenly begins ranting and stripping naked. He\u2019s cracked from the pressure, you see, the pressure of defending a huge company whose product has killed over 400 people. Allegedly.\nNow, knowing this little, you can make a good guess as to how this plays out. Michael is there to prop Arthur up, make him just presentable enough to placate the company their firm is representing (Unorth). But Arthur will have none of that, and he goes rogue. I bet you can predict that at some point Michael Clayton will figure out that Arthur\u2019s NOT crazy, even with a manic-depressive history, that the evil conglomerate manufacturer really IS killing people. It\u2019s not a great leap of faith to come to this conclusion.\nMeanwhile, Michael has other troubles. He\u2019s trying to buy back the restaurant he and his brother used to own, and he\u2019s coming up short. He has partial custody of his young son, and although his ex isn\u2019t the stereotypical screaming harpy you see in most movies, she\u2019s not falling over herself to help Michael out. Oh, and his other brother is a very slowly recovering alkie and druggie. So there are home issues. All this while Michael has to run around putting out fires.\nI always enjoy watching George Clooney act. He\u2019s sympathetic while not seeming to be a victim; he seems real and genuine, but not a superhero or righteous crusader. He continues to seem like a guy you wouldn\u2019t mind hanging with, or being the godfather to your kids, or maybe serving frappucinos at Starbucks. You know, a reg\u2019lar fella. No fault, really, with his work here, for which he was nominated for an Oscar. He\u2019s overworked and completely consumed by stress and anxiety, which happens to a lot of us. With Michael, though, he can\u2019t throw himself into one thing (e.g., family) to deal with the stress of another (e.g., work), because each offers plenty o\u2019 stress.\nBy contrast, Swinton (who won Best Supporting Actress) give a much less-nuanced performance, what little we get to see of it. She plays the lead counsel of the Big Evil Company, and I figured we\u2019d see her being all conflicted and stuff. There was some ethical conflict there, yes, but not nearly enough. Her Karen Crowder isn\u2019t very well developed at all, and she doesn\u2019t really even seem like a decent (i.e., decisive) lawyer. Karen\u2019s unsure about everything, and although that may have been meant to illustrate to us how she\u2019s terminally conflicted defending an evil company or something, it certainly didn\u2019t come across that way. Still, I\u2019ll blame these shortcomings more on the script than on the acting, which wasn\u2019t bad.\nBookending with Clooney in terms of awesome performances was Wilkinson as Arthur Edens, a man who has finally decided to do the right thing after only sixteen years. Bitter, but only at himself, Arthur spends a good portion of the movie trying to figure out what to do - confront UNorth, confront his bosses, run away, kill himself, and so on. Arthur is passionate in finally acknowledging his complicity, and Wilkinson offers more emotion in his stubborn off-his-meds behavior than in the prim, stiff am-I-good-enough doubtings of Karen. Wilkinson, like Clooney, was nominated for an Oscar but didn\u2019t win. Wilkinson makes you give a rat\u2019s ass about the story a lot more than Swinton does, and that\u2019s the key difference here.\nIn all, Michael Clayton is slight entertainment, but it\u2019s basically just a typical big-bad-corporation legal \u201cthriller\u201d that manages to not be terribly thrilling. The one thing it has going for it, other than the excellent acting, is that some of the events in the movie are not told sequentially. This is good and bad; good that it helps fill in gaps later, bad that those gaps had to be filled in."}

It\u2019s fast paced, managing to pack in hundreds of pages of narrative into about 110 minutes of movie. On the downside, the movie ends a bit earlier than perhaps it should have (i.e., not at the same point as the end of the book on which it\u2019s based), leaving the viewer wanting more.\nThe movie (based on the Phillip Pullman book) is set in a sort of alternative universe, one in which humans\u2019 souls exist outside their bodies, manifest as animals. Before adulthood, these souls, called daemons, can take any number of forms (kitty cat, ferret, tiger, bug, bird), but once the human experiences Changes in the Body, the daemon settles into one form. Also, although the time and place seem to be comparative with 18th century Britain, there are technological advances that would seem out of place in our universe, such as jet-fueled zeppelins and flying boats and whatnot.\nLyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards) is a young girl attending a private school within the prestigious Jordan College. She\u2019s an impish mischief maker, but she also has some nobility within her, earning an unspoken respect from her peers. At any rate, Lyra, through her uncle Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) learns of the existence of Dust, a particular matter that her uncle believes helps determine the psychological makeup of all humans, by way of their daemons. Ah, but this goes against the teachings of the church, aka the Magisterium, which states that all rights and will derive from the Authority, aka God. (Yes, this is an antireligion book.) Asriel heads north to research Dust further; Lyra\u2019s left behind but soon finds a new ally: Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman), a \u201cfriend\u201d of the college, who is also heading north and wishes Lyra to accompany her. But is Mrs. Coulter as perfectly awesome as she seems? Lyra\u2019s not completely without resources, though. The Master of Jordan gave her an alethiometer, a curious device that allows the holder to learn Truth about something, provided he or she can read it correctly. This would be the Golden Compass of the title; it\u2019s not really a compass, although it\u2019s kind of goldish. At any rate, there are only a handful of these things left in the world, and very, very few people possess the skills to interpret their symbol combinations. It\u2019s the sort of thing that takes decades for people to master, so of course Lyra learns she has the innate ability to read the alethiometer. Meanwhile, kids are disappearing; the rumor is that they are being taken to the north country, up where the armored (yes, really) bears live. Lyra encounters bears and witches and gypsy pirates (known as gyptians) and a cowboy named Lee Scoresby (Sam Elliott).\nAnd so ends my verbose plot description. So you can see how much plot\u2019s being thrown in there, but here\u2019s the cool thing - it all flows very smoothly; you don\u2019t have to stop and wonder why people are doing what they\u2019re doing, why these two are fighting, and so on. The exposition, so crucial to the story, is gently eased in; you hardly even know it\u2019s there. Which is great, because who wants a movie that gets all thinky on you? If Harry Potter and Narnia aren\u2019t your cup of tea, you\u2019ll dislike this movie, but for me it a great feel-good movie. First, you\u2019re able to identify with Lyra, even if you\u2019re NOT a twelve-year-old girl. Second, the movie is wholly creative and inventive, creating an alternately beautiful and terrifying world that seems as real as our own. And third, the movie is exceptionally well cast, particularly Ian McKellen as Iorek Byrnison and Eva Green as Seraphina Pekkala. Oh, and Kidman and Craig are equal to the task.\nIt\u2019s not known at this point whether a sequel (The Subtle Knife is the second book) will be made, owing to a perceived lack of interest at the box office, but if there\u2019s any flaw in the movie it\u2019s in the ending. Now, I\u2019m certainly not going to spoil the ending here, but I will point out that the movie ends at a different point than the first book ends, and it\u2019s not necessarily a good stopping point. Apparently the makers of the movie needed a \u201chappy\u201d ending; the book\u2019s ending is a bit more downbeat. Hopeful, perhaps, but definitely not a crowd pleaser. Still, the movie ended abruptly for me, since I\u2019d read the books, and I was left feeling a little unsatisfied (and dissatisfied)."}

Finally, finally, and finally, Hollywood gives us a movie that actually and perfectly embodies the spirit of Theodor Geisel, aka Dr. Seuss. Criminey crickets! Horton Hears a Who! is wholly imaginative fun that feels like it's channeling the good doctor's playful exuberance and ingenious creativity with every syllable and splotch of animation.\nThe biggest difference between this movie and the recent adaptations of Seuss's The Cat in the Hat and How the Grinch Stole Christmas is that Horton Hears a Who! was created using CGI animation, not live action, not adults in goofy costumery. And that permits directors Jimmy Hayward and Steve Martino to, well, animate a Dr. Seuss book. Part of the charm of Seuss's books was their otherworldly atmosphere, with just a touch of reality thrown in so kids could identify with the characters and underlying themes. And it makes such a wonderful difference! When you throw actors into suits, you take away both the personality of the actor and the appeal of the Seussiverse, if you will. What you're left with is an overproduced, unpleasant mess that tries desperately to be relevant and interesting and fails miserably at both.\nAnyway, back to this movie. Horton (voiced by Jim Carrey) is an elephant in a world sort of like ours, but not really (as evidenced by the myriad odd creatures inhabiting Horton's jungle). Now, if you've read the books you know that Horton's a bit of what we'd call a free spirit. He has a short attention span, and he's always so hap-hap-happy. The kids in the jungle (er, animal kids) look up to him, sort of as a big plaything (since Horton's an adult, supposedly), and he in turn tries to teach them about the jungle and its mysteries and dangers.\nWell, one day Horton spots a stray clover floating by on a breeze, and he hears what he believes is a cry for help. Oh, but it's not the clover, it's a speck ON the clover. And way down within the heart of that speck, there's a whole 'nother world, the land of Whoville. Populated by the Whos, of course. And it seems that when the flower became detached from its root, strange things had been afoot in the land of the Whos, like strange cloud formations and odd weather patterns.\nThe mayor of Whoville (voiced by Steve Carell) is a bit of a screw up, a patsy, a boob (in the words of the town's head councilman, voiced by Dan Fogler of Knocked Up); he's in his position to look nice and smile wide. The Mayor has 96 daughters - and one son! - and a lovely wife, and between spending time with them and planning for the Whocentennial, he's worrying about the signs of impending doom he keeps seeing.\nAnd then Horton says hello, and those signs become reality. And it's up to Horton to find a safe place for the speck to sit, so that the Whoniverse (see what I did there?) can survive in peace, as it has for centuries. But there's a problem - the other denizens of the jungle, led by Kangaroo (voiced by Carol Burnett, who's apparently alive and well), who believes the speck represents imagination, which she doesn't want the jungle kidlets to have - because then they'll be questioning authority, and we can't have that! (Seuss was quite the subversive.) So Horton races to get the speck to shelter while fending off attacks from monkeys and vultures and whatnot.\nCarrey is awesome as the childlike Horton, a kind-hearted, if perhaps a bit naive, pachyderm who truly believes in what he cannot see (i.e., the Whos), because he can be wild and spastic and hilarious. I mean, after all, it is a cartoon; characters should be outlandish, not subtly shaded. Carrey's riffing (and ad-libbing, I bet) will remind you of Robin Williams or Eddie Murphy in their signature animated roles - untethered joy and comedy. Steve Carrell is aces as the beleaguered mayor who does believe in Horton's existence, even if no one else does; he has sort of an easygoing flustered personality about him that is the counterbalancing adult to Horton's whimsy.\nThe movie's basically a metaphor for love, frankly. Kangaroo says she does not believe in anything she cannot see or touch, and it's evident that she lives on the fear of the other animals, not on their love. She doesn't even appear to love her own son; she thinks of herself more of a caregiver than a mother. Kids should always mind their parents, no matter how dumb their requests and actions are. So Kangaroo does not believe in the Whos, because she cannot see them, just as she does not believe in love. But of course, since this is an animated movie, all does turn out okay in the end, with Lessons Learned."}

See, because vampires can't exist in direct sunlight - bet you didn't know that - so thirty consecutive days without sunlight would be like heaven to them. But that's about it as far as originality for this by-the-numbers gorefest, although the thick arched eyebrows of Josh Hartnett provide some measure of entertainment.\nBarrow, Alaska is the northernmost point in the United States, and as previously noted in Insomnia, that area of the world is plunged into darkness for an entire month of every year. This is useful for the purposes of the story here, because it provides an deadline for the denouement - the vampires have to be out of there before the sun rises again. So our intrepid hero and his motley gang of scruffy, bundled-up citizens have a full month to deal with their vampire infestation.\nSheriff Eben Oleson (Hartnett) is the small-town Johnny Law whom everyone knows and likes, although he keeps his feelings close inside, as most squinty-eyed, jut-jawed heroes do. On the last day of actual sunlight, he's busy making sure everyone's doing okay and is prepared for the coming darkness. Then he runs into a weird man known only as The Stranger (Ben Foster) who obliquely warns everyone that \"they\" are coming that evening, when night falls. Who are they? Superstrong vampires, that's who, and don't think they'll stop until they consume every last drop of your blood, or turn you into one of them. (The last part didn't make a lot of sense to me - why create someone who'll just be competition for food?) No hero is complete without some love interest, so we get Stella (Melissa George), Eben's ex-wife. They're attempting a separation, but naturally Stella - through hopelessly contrived events - is unable to depart the town before the last plane leaves. (How come no flights can arrive or depart the airport when it's dark out? The town has electricity. Maybe they can, but the plot wouldn't permit it.) So she and Eben are stuck together, arguing over who gets to save the town. Seriously. On more than one occasion, Stella says, \"I'm coming with you!\" - no way she's gonna let him do it alone! - and most of the time Eben overrules her, but not always, because he's a Thoughtful Hero as well.\nAnd to underscore Eben's emotional ties to the community, we're also introduced to his kid brother Jake, who looks to be young enough to be Eben's son. True to the genre, Jake desperately seeks the approval of his successful (to a point) older brother, and he tries to save the town as well. But no, he's not old enough, and Eben is responsible for him, and darned if some kid's gonna be the hero instead of him! So there's that.\nThe movie leans rather heavily on its setting to move the plot along; the special effects are rather ho-hum, and the acting is weak. And it's not that Hartnett can't act - he's actually developing into quite the fine thesp - but here he's just sort of drifting along like a windblown snowpile. George is cute and perky and occasionally serious, but she too isn't quite up to the task. And that's perfectly okay if your leading man is charismatic or if the special effects wow the audience so much that they don't notice the wooden performances, but here that's not the case. You wind up turning your eyes to the gore that you'd expect to see in a vampire movie, but the gore isn't even especially interesting or vicious. Some scenes are disturbing, though; turns out the only way to kill a vampire is by beheading it, as guns apparently have little effect on them. Which doesn't stop at least one suicidal maniac from shotgunning several bloodsuckers in order to give his fellow humans some cover.\nBottom line: Good, interesting concept, dreary execution. The movie's based on a series of graphic novels, and my assumption is that the novels themselves had more character and pizazz on the page than this movie does on the screen."}

In Bruges is a low-rent Pulp Fiction knockoff, but it's a knockoff that pays off in spades, with strong, believable acting, excellent cinematography, and a taut, amusing script.\nRay (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) have just completed a rather difficult job and have been ordered by their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) to repair to the idyllic town of Bruges to lay low for up to two weeks. \"Two weeks with you?\" Ray exclaims to Ken. \"No way!\" Ray's a novice to the world of hit-manning, and being as young as he is he's not too keen to spend two weeks in any spot that's not teeming with hot women or other fun things to do. Bruges isn't exactly a Mecca of excitement, you see. On the other hand, the more seasoned Ken is pretty happy with staying in the placid little burg, because it'll give him time to sightsee and take it easy.\nBoth men start to believe there's something else afoot. Why Bruges, after all? They're Londoners, so why not hide out in London, or even in the English countryside? No, they had to schlep over to Belgium. (There are plenty of Belgian jokes, and a smart dig at Americans that was both accurate and snicker-worthy.) But before Ray can get properly bored, he meets a sweet young lady named Chloe (Clemence Poesy, late of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) working on a movie that's being filmed right there in Bruges, and he sees a chance to redeem himself for past sins - but apparently Chloe has a few dark secrets of her own.\nGleeson and Farrell are wonderful together, and the film avoids such clich\u00e9s as the young impetuous hothead and the veteran killer on one last job, and you never get the impression that they're just a couple of lunkheads who go around killing people randomly. (You know the type: Guy gets tired awaiting further instructions, so he shoots someone to keep in practice.) And of course, nothing goes as Ray and Ken expect it to go. There's no way, of course, that they're going to stay the entire two weeks in the podunk town with nothing happening, right? Yeah, probably not.\nSo they wait around for Harry to call and give them further instructions, and when he does all hell really breaks loose. But setting that aside for the moment, here are some other entertaining aspects of the movie: drug use, gunplay, midgets, and blood. Yes, midgets! Okay, dwarfs. And although there's no dwarf tossing, there is a karate chop to a dwarf's neck, which is awesome in and of itself.\nAnother plus is the film is remarkably well shot. Filming on location in the actual town of Brugge in Belgium, cinematographer Eigil Bryld brilliantly juxtaposes the angularity of the buildings and the beauty of the landscapes with the brutality of the men's violent behavior and coarse language. The pooling of blood on stark, gritty pavement, surrounded by gleaming snowdrifts and the pulchritude and quiet desperation of Bruges itself.\nAlthough not as wittily intelligent as Pulp Fiction, In Bruges is still quite clever - and not too clever for its own good, either. It's not one of those movies that tosses in funny dialog just to be funny or so-called twists just to keep the viewer guessing. Two charming, gutsy performances by Gleeson as the unorthodox older man and Farrell as the twitchy younger one boost this one up a notch about the typical caper thriller."}

It's sort of a combination of 300 and The Polar Express and leans heavily on CGI effects to sell itself. This usually works, but as with Polar Express the facial expressions of the humans look more like a snazzy video game than anything approaching realistic.\nMost Americans learned about the tale of Beowulf in high school, about how the young hero slayed the creature Grendel and became a legend. Here, Beowulf's tale is expanded and clarified; what really happened when he strode into that cave to take on the murderous demon? Turns out that Grendel's got a mom, and she's not the forgive-and-forget kind, and before you know it, Beowulf's sliding down a slippery slope of his own device.\nVoiced by Ray Winstone, the youthful Beowulf and his band of warriors arrive in Denmark to slay the beast that's been terrorizing the towns. King Hrothgar (Anthony Perkins) has offered half the riches of his kingdom to whomever can lift their curse. Grendel does come, and after slaying some of Beowulf's men (including biting off a head and chewing it), he's finally taken down by Beowulf himself with his bare arms - but that's just the beginning of Beowulf's troubles, as Grendel's mom is a bit unhappy.\nThe voice characterizations are top notch. It's good to see the gifted Winstone get some work as the hero, because he doesn't really fit the mold of matin\u00e9e idol; he's more of a craggy, rough-looking character. But here, he's as smooth as Russell Crowe, thanks to the wonders of CGI. Hopkins is his usual Anthony Hopkins self (sorry, I mean Sir Anthony), lending gravitas that a king should have. Jolie, it should be noted, was a bit unhappy with the resulting CGI for her role, which showed perhaps a bit more skin than the actress had intended to have shown. (Sure, it's not actually her body, but it looks like her, so...) But she's silkily cruel as the water demon out to avenge her son. Offering stout support as always are Brendan Gleeson and John Malkovich, as Beowulf's right-hand man and the king's top commander, respectively. Robin Wright Penn is merely okay in a rather important role as the queen; amazingly, she doesn't look nearly as gorgeous as the real-life Wright Penn does.\nBut it's the CGI of the humans that I found a little off putting. Rather than looking seamless in a pseudo-comic-book style, as in 300, the people here look a bit creepy, as if they were originally created to appear in some cheesy 3-D porn. I mean some cheesy Flash animation. As with the earliest Pixar films, the animation of humans just doesn't look right; with The Polar Express (directed by Robert Zemeckis, as was Beowulf), the people looked almost creepy and lacked a large range of expressions.\nBeowulf is an exciting action movie and contains plenty of intense, well-animated combat scenes, but it falls a little short of being the technical marvel or full-bore sweeping epic that it wants to be."}

But the movie veers sharply from charming comedy to turgid melodrama and never truly finds its way. In spite of some spirited performances (particularly by Lane), Griffin Dunne's film doesn't really have an identity, and without a solid identity, it can be a tough movie to follow and enjoy.\nLiz (Lane) and Finn (Yelchin) are a dysfunctional family living in New York. She's a cokehead and drunk who puts out for some of her masseuse clients (but she does have a degree in massage therapy). He's a good kid who sometimes enables her, because she's a great mom during those rare moments when she's not hammered. At any rate, fate intervenes and keeps Finn from seeing his dad, a renowned anthropologist, in the Southern Hemisphere; instead, he and his mom are schlepped to the Hamptons so she can give Ogden Osbourne (Sutherland) his daily rubdowns, and here Finn decides to observe a different kind of tribe, that of the filthy rich. Of course, he can't just observe, and he slowly ingratiates himself into Osbourne's fiefdom, befriending his grandson Bryce (Chris Evans, who looks like a young Stephen Baldwin) and falling in love with his granddaughter (Kristen Stewart, once the tyke from Panic Room). Liz and Finn are given a house and a car, and naturally the rumors fly about Liz's true relationship with Osbourne.\nMost of the acting ranges from sweet (Yelchin) to a bit hammy (Sutherland, who even gets to sing), but it's Lane who truly stands out with a bravura, top-notch performance. Her Liz is intensely and simultaneously vulnerable and strong; she lives not for herself but for the love of her son, which has ebbed quite substantially in recent years. Liz has to do battle with her teen son, her own ambitions and self-confidence, and the suspicious eyes of Osbourne's family, particularly his daughter (Elizabeth Perkins), a bit of a lush in her own right. Lane is still exquisitely beautiful, and she carries herself with a fragile grace; she almost seems attainable to a normal person, in other words, not like a Star.\nThe movie covers some pretty strong subjects, from sexual awakenings, gun violence, major drug use (including acid), and murder, but often it feels like just a melting pot of weirdness, as if the protagonists were merely flitting from tragedy to tragedy; Finn is sort of a combination between Dean Moriarity and Homer Bailey. But unlike the wallflower Bailey, as played by Tobey Maguire, Yelchin's Finn is good and sincere, but he's proactive. He desperately wants his mom to get better, but he also wants things for himself, like a warm female. He's a smartass, but he's not some grinning idiot who's happy to take the kindness of others without offering anything in return.\nOh, and then there's the film's eventual villain, a person you'll spot a mile away, a good thirty minutes before his identity is revealed. The movie will ask, \"Who could have done this?\" and you'll reply, \"That guy, over there. Duh.\" It's that obvious. At first, I thought that perhaps it was a little too obvious, that the movie would pull a switcheroo at the last minute. You know, a red herring to throw me off the scent. But, nope. Fraid not. It was that person all along. And that kind of annoyed me, because up until then I was sure that the movie was going to be tightly plotted, with some genuine twists tossed in. Sadly, no. And the ending is a little too clean for my tastes; I like my endings jagged, like a used sponge."}

It's another comedy starring Will Ferrell as a man-child in a strange haircut! Will it be funny? Yes, because of two things: First, it's set in the 1970s, which was the funniest decade (to laugh at) ever, and second, it's a sports movie, and those are almost always awesome. It has wacky characters in improbable scenarios, and it has scantily clad women and profanity. It's a can't-lose comedy.\nIt's 1976, and Jackie Moon's Flint, Michigan Tropics are part of the American Basketball Association (ABA), which has just announced plans to merge with the more-popular National Basketball Association. Trouble is, only the top four teams will be assimilated, and the Tropics are pretty awful. About all they have going for them is the attitude of Moon, their owner/coach/player, and the play of their best player, Clarence \"Coffee\" Black (Andre Benjamin). The Tropics have acquired a seasoned veteran named Monix (Woody Harrelson), who has a championship ring from his time with the Boston Celtics in hopes of making it up to fourth place. Can they do it? Minor-league sports have long been ripe for parody; see Slap Shot or Bull Durham. But there's something doubly appealing about the wild and woolly lower-level pro leagues combined with the zany, colorful atmosphere of the 1970s. I mean, look at the fashions! The hairstyles! The sheer loudness! Semi-Pro is reminiscent (and perhaps a little derivative) of Slap Shot more than anything else, and that's a compliment. Slap Shot more or less set the standard for lowbrow sports comedies (Bull Durham was much more sophisticated), and it included elements that made their way into Semi-Pro as well, such as the walking-clich\u00e9 sportscasters and the bed-hopping chicanery - there's just no plot thread that has Ferrell hooking up with the ex-wife of one of his players, like Paul Newman in Slap Shot. But that's okay; in fact, Moon actually makes note of his lack of sexual prowess in a talk to the ball girls - \"Some of you I wanted to sleep with, but I never got around to it...Mama always said I procrastinate too much...\" The movie works also because Moon, like many of Will Ferrell's goofy characters, never takes himself seriously. He's just a showman in a showy lower-level league. He's immensely popular in Flint, but more as a promoter of his team and the city than of an actual player or coach. In truth, he can't play OR coach, but somehow the Tropics will do okay regardless.\nThe supporting cast is a lot of fun, too. Somewhere along the line, Woody Harrelson (North Country, No Country for Old Men) has turned into a very good character actor. Love his Dutch Boy haircut here - or is it a Dorothy Hamill? Or maybe it's Mike Patterson's wife Deanna from the comic strip For Better or for Worse. Regardless, his Monix is fantastic, excelling in the athletic scenes as well as the slower dramatic scenes. (It's his second basketball movie, following 1992's White Men Can't Jump.) Maura Tierney as his ex-lover, Andrew Daly as a buttoned-down broadcaster, and Andy Richter as Jackie's \"son-friend\" are all great as well.\nI think it goes without saying that if you like Will Ferrell movies, you'll like this one. It's got plenty for your inner frat boy to love, from lewd comments to a plethora of profanity. No nudity, though, so you skin aficionados can relax. Or get irate, whatever. But the script is punchy and a lot of fun, and Ferrell brings it all together.\n***"}
< {"rating": "8", "date": "2 March 2008", "title_id": "tt0373883", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "Don't fear this reaper", "content": "To tell the truth, I expected this update of the 1978 John Carpenter slasher classic to be just over-the-top, mind-boggling gory. Rob Zombie, long known for fronting the heavy metal band White Zombie and having recently jumped into the movie business, seems to be the sort of director who favors viscera over volition; subtlety ain't really in the mix. But I was surprised at Halloween, because it's faithful to the tone and vision of the original without going overboard on blood and guts. You're not grossed out just to be grossed out.\nThe movie takes us from Michael Myers' early childhood in the 1970s, with older sister Judith, stripper-mom Deborah, mean-and-in-a-cast-drunk stepdad Ronnie (William Forsythe), and baby sister Laurie. Michael is pushed around by bullies and lives in a tumultuous household; although his mom loves him dearly, his stepdad hates him and does everything he can to destroy the kid's psyche. On the outside, Michael seems like your typical quiet, reserved ten year old, and the only hint we get that something might be amiss is when he confronts two heinous bullies in the school bathroom, which gets him into some trouble. But even a short time later, as one of the villains is being bludgeoned to death by the mask-clad Michael (it's Halloween, of course), we're still not sure what's going on beneath the boy's cool facade - does he know what he's doing is wrong? Is he even cognizant of his actions? The movie takes its time explaining a bit more of Michael's backstory, attempting to explain - but not fully reveal - how he came to be the unthinking killing machine that we see in later movies. But a word of caution: This is a reboot of the series, so it's possible that things that happened in the original won't happen here, and vice versa; it's as if an alternative timeline were being created. That's good, actually, because it restores the potential to be surprised.\nThe atmosphere of the seventies and early eighties is truthfully realized, I think, complete with a, shall we say, lessened interest in child safety. The movie feels like it belongs in the same universe as 1981's Poltergeist, not to mention the original Halloween. Not always easy to do when you have a huge budget to work with, as Zombie did, because sometimes the added effects overcomplicate scenes instead of returning us to a simpler time. (Yeah, the seventies were simpler! Look, parents let their kids wander up and down the streets alone on Halloween to get candy from strangers!) I enjoyed Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Loomis, as he's more restrained than usual and seems more like a clone of Donald Pleasance (who played Loomis in most of the original movies), which is good. And there are plenty of familiar faces in the movie: Brad Dourif plays a sheriff, Clint Howard is a doctor, Sybil Danning is a nurse, Danielle Harris (who has been in three of the films, not as the same character) is one of Laurie's friends, Dee Wallace is Laurie's adoptive mom, and Sid Haig is a gravedigger. Kudos to Zombie for using so many expressive, interesting actors in his film.\nThe movie doesn't completely avoid horror clich\u00e9s. For one thing, teens who have sex die almost immediately thereafter. And if you're a bad person (bitchy teen, grouchy drunk), you'll die. And perhaps it's not always a good thing to really hope that certain characters die, but in the horror world, it's almost expected. As you watch Halloween, you just know which characters are gonna get it. But then there's a curveball in there: Because this is a reboot, Zombie doesn't telegraph whether or not people are gonna be offed; major characters that made it through the original first movie might not make it through this one. That makes the entire experience fresh and inviting, open to all sorts of possibilities.\nOverall, Halloween is a very good remake/reboot of a time-tested classic. It doesn't have the gore of, say, a Saw or Hostel, but it does have more blood than the original Halloween, so beware. And there's plenty of nudity and sexual situations and profanity. So yeah, don't let the little ones watch it.\n***"}

That lack of experience is completely invisible in this surprisingly taut and creative work of sheer genius.\nIn Vantage Point, the President of the United States is assassinated moments after taking the podium to give a speech on antiterrorism in Spain. The event is then replayed numerous times through the eyes of various characters, and each replay gives the audience additional insight as to what has actually happened. It's not just a matter of determining the chain of events, it's a matter of figuring out who is involved in the shooting, and to what extent.\nDennis Quaid plays Thomas Barnes, a Secret Service agent who's being eased back into the rotation; the previous year, he had foiled an earlier attempt on President Ashton's life by jumping in front of a bullet. Now he's on the job in Spain, keeping a watchful - yet nervous - eye out for potential problems. Matthew Fox plays his comrade, Agent Taylor, who's been the buffer for Barnes with the other men on the team. Forest Whitaker is an American tourist in the crowd during the speech, taping the proceedings with his Handicam, and Sigourney Weaver is a tough-as-nails news-program reporter who watches the events unfold before her on TV screens, helpless to do anything.\nAt times, watching this movie feels like a particularly violent punch to the stomach, because so much of the movie - but not all of it - is shot in cinema verite' style, and you honestly feel like you're watching raw footage. And this filming style yields a movie that's just packed with searing emotion, taking you from shuddering lows to absolute euphoria. Whether you're looking at the events through Howard's camera or on the monitors in the GNN newstruck, you simply cannot turn away from the devastation. It's a testament to cinematographer Amir Mokri that the fast-paced action and unmitigated violence lend such an aura of reality to the proceedings that you feel as if you're watching the whole thing live on CNN at that very moment.\nAs I said, the events are replayed through the perspectives of various characters, including Barnes and President Ashton (William Hurt), and each time we learn a little bit more. What events occurred before the Big Speech? Did anyone know there was a potential threat against the president's life? We need to piece things together ourselves, as if we are investigating the crime detachedly. It's worth noting that in the earliest scenes, the atmosphere within the courtyard in which Ashton is to make his speech is markedly different from that outside the complex, where people are basically hanging him in effigy.\nThe entire cast is outstanding, but particular notice should be given to Quaid, as this may be his best work since Traffic, perhaps ever. Quaid has always been a poor man's (or younger) version of Harrison Ford, but even in his heyday he was never Mister Action Guy. Here he's a vulnerable human being, a shell of a man trying to recover both physically and mentally from the previous attempt on the president's life. Thomas Barnes is no superhero, and because Quaid is so good you never feel certain, not even nearing the end of the movie, that he's going to save the day and make everything all right. He might, and he might not. The bad guys might actually win.\nIt's no surprise, too, that the perennially awesome Whitaker is outstanding here. His Howard Lewis is in Spain basically to get away from his wife, from whom he's estranged, in an effort to recharge and figure out how he wants to proceed - and, of course, to witness an historic speech. It's not implausible that an American tourist would be in the audience, and if there's one thing we Americans like it's our gadgets. Lewis is the common-man counterpart to Barnes and Ashton, a Johnny-on-the-spot at a critical, horrifying moment.\nHad this movie been released later in the year (or even late last year), it would likely have been a major Oscar contender. From my vantage point, it seems the studio got this one wrong. Vantage Point is extremely well done, evocative, exhausting, and ultimately rewarding exercise in realistic film making."}

It is gorgeously filmed and well paced, and its denouement will make your heart soar.\nFor the unrequited love of a girl, young Tristan (Charlie Cox) vows to bring back a fallen star. But once he makes it to the crater where the star hit, he realizes the star isn't a rock at all - it's a beautiful young lady named Yvaine (Claire Danes), who's none to pleased to have fallen from her high-and-mighty perch in the firmament. But promises being promises, Tristan ensnares Yvaine using an enchanted chain and begins their journey back to his village, so that he may present the star to his love, Victoria (Sienna Miller).\nBut Tristan and Yvaine are unwittingly part of a larger story; the king of the enchanted realm (Peter O'Toole) has just died, and the new ruler will be he among the sons who possesses the kingdom's sacred ruby, which the dying king had tossed up into the heavens, where it smacked into Yvaine, thus bringing her crashing to Earth. Now all the king's remaining sons are on the hunt for the ruby, not knowing Yvaine wears it around her neck.\nMeanwhile, three witch sisters have noticed the falling star, which is a major omen in the kingdom of Stormhold; whoever can possess the fallen star will be immortal. You don't have to be pure evil to think immortality might be kind of fun, so the oldest of the sisters, Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) sets off to find it as well.\nDuring the long journey back home, Tristan learns about love and his own parentage. Oh, does he learn about love! With a griping, angry denizen of the sky as his prisoner, Tristan thinks he has everything worked out; he'll present Yvaine to Victoria, who will marry him instead of the cad Humphery (and really, could he be anything but a cad, with that name?).\nThis is more than a simple fantasy story of good versus evil. It's about telling the difference between being infatuated and being in love; it's about trust and righteousness; it's about doing the right thing, even when it seems impossible to do so.\nBased on a Neil Gaiman story, Stardust is impeccably written (it was adapted for the screen by director Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman), with rich characterizations, top-notch acting, and wondrous visual effects. Robert DeNiro gets a showy role as the captain of a flying ship (sort of a cross between a dirigible and a pirate ship), and although it IS a showy role, DeNiro is far from hammy in it - he is, in fact, outstanding. Pfeiffer is remarkably despicable as the ugly-then-beautiful-then-ugly rotten witch Lamia. She doesn't dress down for the role, she dresses down and dirty and Lamia is not a shallow, one-dimensional character in the least. A lesser actress would have played the part a little over the top, portraying Lamia as a power-mad demagogue obsessed with looking pretty, but Pfeiffer delivered a multilayered performance, fulsome in its depth.\nDanes is also a huge asset here. Her dancing eyes and rubied lips (matching the stone, of course), coupled with the CGI-added glow about her (since she is, after all, a fallen star) lend a real ethereal feel to her character, but it's her acting that lends the appropriate gravitas; otherwise, Yvaine would be a simple, irritated version of Victoria.\nAnd although the role of Tristan might have been given to an actor offering only a callow performance, Charlie Cox is fantastic as the protagonist. He doesn't just let things happen to him, he makes things happen through decisive actions, good or bad. He's forthright and honest; he's just blinded by the prospect of love from Victoria.\nExquistely photographed and with quick, efficient pacing that doesn't let itself get bogged down in the special effects of the moment, Stardust is a real treat for fans of fantasy novels and movies."}

But unlike most military-crime dramas, he does not unfold some huge conspiracy that reaches to the very top of the command chain; rather, he has to come face to face with a reality that runs counter to what he knows about his boy.\nHank Deerfield is one of those clear-thinking, straightforward, honest characters that Tommy Lee Jones has played time and time again. In short, he's a man who knows what he wants and how to get it, most of the time, and yet here he is baffled by the sudden disappearance of his youngest son, Mike. All he has is Mike's cell phone, which includes short videos shot in Iraq.\nQuickly, though, the case changes from a missing-persons situation to a murder, as a burned, dismembered body is found near Mike's base. However, first there's a question of jurisdiction - was Mike killed on the street and then dragged to within the base's property line? No one seems to care much about how Mike came to be where he did; the official stance is that he was the victim of a drug deal gone wrong, perhaps a Mexican gang.\nHank is frustrated, and he feels that there's more to the story than meets the eye. After all, he knows Mike would never be mixed up in drugs or anything illicit; he was a good boy. Could it be that his death was caused by one of the other three soldiers he'd hung around with the night he died? Hank's determined to get to the bottom of it all, if only to preserve the memory he has of his son. He managed to enlist the help of a local detective, Emily Sanders (Charlize Theron), who has to fight through monumental red tape (and the patronizing attitude of her fellow cops) in order to work the case.\nIn the end, though, it's not about exactly what happened to Mike, it's really a referendum on the insanity of war. What happened to Mike in Iraq? Did he return to the States demonstrably different from when he came? It's very difficult for the straight-shooting veteran (along with his wife Joan, played by Susan Sarandon) to grasp just how different Mike is from the boy who left home to join the armed forces, following in the footsteps of his old man and his older (and now deceased) brother.\nThis is a mystery that is solved in the end, but it's not a simple explanation; even though the motives and means for Mike's murder are revealed, nothing is really settled; only more, deeper questions on top of questions emerge. This is definitely a point in the movie's favor. A typical murder mystery might be deciphered halfway through, with the protagonist fingering the villain in the third act, and everyone goes on to live happily ever after. This is so far from the case in this movie that it might as well be another zip code. We know who did it, we know why they did it, but we don't know - and Hank can only guess, despairingly - what happened to allow the situation to even occur.\nJones is brilliant as always, and he earned an Oscar nomination as the taciturn Hank Deerfield, a resolute, devout man who is unwilling to believe that which runs against the facts he already has. Hank, a former MP, had also a methodical, insightful investigator in his own right, and his analysis of the developing case allows him to hold out hope that his son's legacy, if not his life, will be kept intact. Theron is solid as the sympathetic detective; a tough-minded, almost distant cop whose own tenacity proves essential to the case. (Although arguably she comes off pretty uncaring early on.) In the Valley of Elah, named for the place where David fought Goliath, works because of the well-cast Jones and an ending that leaves plenty of issues unresolved, to its credit. There's interaction with Emily's son that could have been excised (although it serves as the source for the movie's title), and there's not quite enough interact between Hank (who's investigating, near the base) and Joan (who's still at home, a two-day drive away); true, too, that the stiff-necked bureaucrats are a little too stubborn and uncaring. But Paul Haggis does a good job otherwise of keeping the story on track without revealing too much too soon. Even when the end is in sight, Jones' evocative, empathetic performance keeps us from being too complacent."}

This is great news for some of the werewolves, who are tired of chomping on human flesh, but anathema to others, who dig that sort of thing. The boy is being protected by his family, although his mother (Rhona Mitra) has no clue about his true split nature, from the keep-the-curse stalwarts, led by Varek (Jason Behr). Yes, it's yet another and-a-child-shall-lead-them supernatural-beings tales.\nWhen the bad werewolves figure out who and where Timothy (Matthew Knight) is, they launch an attack, and finally all is revealed to Timothy and his mom, Rachel. This ensures that somewhere near the end of the movie there will be a battle to the death, and only one can survive, either Varek, or the good-guys leader, Jonas (Elias Koteas, who's kind of slumming here). One Varek's team is a busty, evil villainess (Natassia Malthe) and some hippie-looking dude, while Jonas has a grandma, a Native American non-werewolf, a high school athlete and his girlfriend (Jonas' daughter, of course).\nThe trend in recent years has been that werewolves are somewhat equal to bikers or heavy-metal musicians, so that's how Varek's squad is presented, complete with pulse-pounding riding and intro music. By contrast, the good guys are stereotypically a ragtag band scurrying from safe place to safe place, always on the run, always ragged.\nAs werewolf movies go, this one isn't awful, but it's really not all that much to write home about, either. It's got hunky guys and sexy babes, and although there's a lot of violence there's almost no blood at all. (In fact, it's possible the movie would have been better if it had been filmed in black and white.) It has likable and despicable characters, and it manages to shade them all just a hair. Its main selling point just seems to be the true identity of Timothy in relation to everyone else, as revealed in the final third of the movie, but it's just not enough to make the movie remarkable enough to warrant a second look. In other words, it's just okay. It's as dark and dank-looking as, say, Underworld, but without the charisma of a Kate Beckinsale or Michael Speedman to lift the movie."}

Some of these decisions work out well, and others change his life for the worse, forever.\nThe first thing that strikes you about this movie is how authentic everything feels, from the actors to the sets. The movie is set in a crime-ridden section of Boston, with plenty of working-class (and a lot of low-class) denizens with their almost stereotypically comic accents and coarse language. But although Affleck is a local boy, most of the cast isn't; this is, I believe, what they call acting. And, like Clint Eastwood's Mystic River, director Ben Affleck seems to have fully captured the desolate, desperate, and bitter lives of dishonest, disreputable people who often turn to crime and other shenanigans to get by in life. Affleck's Dorchester is unyielding, where hard people live.\nAnother asset is the film's narrative thread. Although the story is told linearly, it's not easy to guess ahead of time what's coming. And it's not a product of the film's moving quickly, as some films do (a fast-paced film means less time for the moviegoer to spot holes in the plot), as there are realistic lulls around every scene's corner. At one point in the movie, with the benefit of watching it at home, I had to pause it quickly to assess the situation at hand, and I tried to predict where the movie was going. I was wrong. It's tightly plotted, but it's not unjustly or implausibly plotted, not in the least.\nCasey Affleck, who looks very much Ben's younger brother but apparently got all of the acting genes in the family, is superb as the conflicted but driven Patrick. His youthfulness notwithstanding (he's only 32), Affleck has the poise and guile of someone much older, a fact that's even noticed by other characters in the film. Faced with incredibly difficult decisions, Patrick has an unwavering sense of what is truly right, but he's never a single-minded, ignorant zealot who knows what he knows. At times during the case, Patrick's faith is shaken, and by the end of the movie he's not completely sure he's made the right decision. In other words, what you get at the end is not a neat, happy ending at all, a fact that shouldn't surprise those who have seen Mystic River.\nAs the anguished (but loose) mother, Amy Ryan notched a Best Supporting Actress nomination, but my opinion is that it's not a nomination that's entirely deserved. Ryan is good, especially for a fairly inexperienced actress, but she's not so commanding or compelling as to warrant that sort of accolade. Faring about the same was the usually steady Morgan Freeman, who's okay here but whose role (and use as a plot device) is a bit underwritten.\nIn fact, it's plain that this movie fails only where Mystic River succeeded so strongly; the former did not lapse into clich\u00e9s, and Gone Baby Gone does. Although the movie generally presents plenty of plausible twists, some of the characters are rather predictable. The final resolution of the plot, in fact, seems almost too obvious in hindsight. Because of this, Gone Baby Gone just misses being a great movie, and instead it has to settle for being a pretty good film with an exhilarating performances from Casey Affleck and Ed Harris."}

Jesse's not so inclined, though, so he assembles a new crew of cutthroats, including the Ford brothers, Charley (Sam Rockwell) and Bob (Affleck). But all the while, Jesse is always looking over his shoulder, sure that someone's about to cut him down, perhaps even someone from his own gang. It doesn't help that he's written terroristic telegrams to governors and presidents alike, either.\nThe story's told through the eyes of Bob Ford, a stammering young man who strongly idolizes Jesse to the point of carrying around a shoebox of dime novels about the legendary outlaw and knowing all sorts of arcane facts about Jesse. Not surprisingly, to Jesse and the rest of the gang (including Bob's brother Charley), this seems childish and downright pathetic, and consequently they don't give the young Ford much respect.\nThis attitude leads to a strange mixture of resentment and continued idolatry on the part of Robert Ford. Should he continue to try to ingratiate himself with Jesse, or should he turn him in to the authorities? Turning him in might make him a hero - the one man who could fell Jesse James - but then he'd really lose whatever remaining respect Jessie had for Bob. (To Bob's thinking, he's one of Jesse's pals.) Affleck's Oscar-nominated performance is wonderful, walking the fine line between hammy and nuanced. A less-capable actor (or, perhaps, an actor less on top of his game) might have taken Bob's idiosyncrasies and run with them, played them up rather than muting them somewhat, making them feel more natural. You get the sense that although Bob is not a good man by any means, he is human in his actions and reactions; he can be a cold-blooded murderer and thief, but how he deals with each minicrisis is neither insincere nor cartoonish. It might be a testament to Affleck that he's able to make something out of the relatively dull character of Robert Ford.\nBrad Pitt is simply Brad Pitt. He's come a long way since movies like Legends of the Fall and A River Runs through It; he's now a Good Actor, not just a beefcake model, and he's effectively menacing and confusing as James, who was (the movie says) going a bit off the deep end in his waning years even without having to deal with the specter of betrayal. James is sad, excitable, angry, dissonant, and Pitt is up to the task. Weirdly enough, though, although Jesse James is the nominal subject of the movie, Pitt takes a backseat to Affleck. This isn't about romanticizing the lawless West and the tough fiends who populated it; it's about dreams crushed and comeuppance delivered.\nAt more than two and a half hours, this is not a broad, unsubtle look at real-life events, and it's not always easy to watch. James is not only not presented positively, he's shown as a realistically diabolical criminal, not just some pretty boy with a lot of \"cute\" facial hair. Multilayered characterizations and sweeping, Oscar-nominated cinematography make this an effective Western."}

I think you do.", "content": "Juno is instantly charming, witty, and just plain a lot of fun to watch. You wouldn't think a movie about teen pregnancy would be much of a hoot, as the topic generally lends itself best to movie-of-the-week weepers and movies with a moral message. Juno has no message, really, other than perhaps \"It's okay to be different\" and \"Love is sometimes found right under your nose.\" It's not steeped in raunchy behavior; instead, it's sweetly charming, almost daring you to find fault with it.\nJuno (Ellen Page) is a self-assured sixteen-year-old junior in high school, and she's just learned - after taking three home pregnancy tests - that she's in the family way. Juno is your slightly atypical caustic, sarcastic teen who takes issue with everything that society offers. To her, being popular is tantamount to being covered in hives. She's into old-school punk rock, not old-school grunge or boy-band music. She's a rebel without a cause, coping with her individuality by virtue of her quick wit and quicker tongue.\nJuno knows who the father is - it's wiry Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera of Superbad). The question of whether Paulie and Juno love each other doesn't even come up; even they know enough to know that their relationship isn't at that level.\nAfter some soul searching, Juno decides she wants to have the baby and then give it up for adoption. She and her best friend Leah find an ad in the Pennysaver, which leads Juno to the house of Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner), a thirtyish couple that desperately wants to have a baby.\nBut again, this is no movie of the week. There's no teary confrontation between mother-to-be and mother-wannabe; there's no tone of Great Importance about how adoption would be Right for the unborn child. The situation is what it is, and it's played for tender laughs. Juno herself says that all she wants to do is pop the baby out and hand it over - but we adults in the audience know there's always a chance that when she does give birth, she'll experience remorse and reneg on the deal. We know it might happen, because we've all seen the similar true-life stories.\nJuno, though, immediately takes a liking to the couple, so she plows wholeheartedly forward with the deal: she gives birth, and they get the child. Easy peasy.\nSupporting Juno in her decisions are her taciturn dad (J. K. Simmons) and stepmom Bren (Allison Janney), both of whom alternate between offering advice and acting exasperated at Juno's latest exploits (in a memorable early scene, Juno recreates the room where the conception took place - outside Paulie's front door). For those of you who know Simmons through his role as Spider-Man's nemesis J. Jonah Jameson, you might be surprised at how tender and loving - although still gruff - Simmons can be. He's a lot like Harry Dean Stanton in Pretty in Pink; he obviously cares very much for his daughter and wants badly to help her, but he's out of his depth as far as pregnancies go.\nAnd at the center of everything is the truly remarkable Ellen Page, a twenty-year-old petite Canadian who wins the audience over with her first appearance. As Juno, Ellen is unique, a girl dancing to the beat of her own different drummer, eschewing the rigid mores of society for a more enlightened, free-spirited outlook on life. Juno is not a delightful, happy-go-lucky girl; she's cynical, arch, and distrustful of popularity. But she's also sweet, honest, and loving, and not just any actress could be shoved into this movie like some cookie-cutter cutie from Central Casting. That's why Page's outstanding performance is such a treasure; she brings out the good and bad in Juno (which, ironically, is one of the \"messages\" the movie has for us).\nJuno is not a low-brow comedy about impending birth. It does not involve a wacky obstetrician, and there are no panicking grandmothers-to-be. The difficulties that Juno faces along her journey to the delivery room are firmly rooted in reality, and they're difficulties that Juno faces with aplomb. There's hardly an insincere note in this delightful gem."}

Although pocked by spurts of pomposity, Sicko uses the \"cruel to be kind\" method of educating its viewers about the issue of universal health care in the United States. \"Look at the other civilized countries,\" Moore says; \"their systems work. When other countries make better cars, we drive them. When other countries make better wine, we drink it. So how come, when other countries have better health-care systems, we don't adopt those systems?\" Moore's plea to the American consumer is an emotional roller coaster, and that's understating things. Excluding people who have no health insurance at all, he describes the difficulties of several individuals across the country, all covered by health insurance, in receiving adequate medical attention. Heart-rending stories are told about people denied tests and procedures that would have ultimately saved their lives, as the HMOs deemed the efforts as \"experimental\" or the patients' status as \"not life threatening.\" Moore includes sworn testimony (before Congress) and interviews of former or current medical reviewers, i.e., people who decide whether a claim will be rejected or accepted. It's pretty damning stuff.\nBut of course, it's the health-care system of other countries that are sometimes held up as the ideal to which America should aspire. But that's socialist propaganda, you say. Government-supported health care? Bah. Socialized medicine is just another way for the commies to get to us and destroy our way of life. But it turns out that's not quite the case; Canadians, for instance, pay nothing for health care and still enjoy comparatively low taxes while living longer than Americans. Oh, and they have a lower infant-mortality rate too; but then again, so does nearly every other civilized nation. Things are bad enough in the US that Moore's Canadian relatives get temporary health care before visiting him in the US, just in case something goes wrong. And some American citizens steal across the border to get themselves some of that free medical attention when they can't get it here.\nMoore also examines, in a touching, gut-wrenching look, the plight of many September 11 first responders. As most people know, the air around Ground Zero in New York was dangerously bad for quite some time after the attacks. Many firefighters, EMTs, and policemen risked their lives to pull others from the wreckage. But there were also many volunteers who happened to be in the area who ran back to the flames and into the smoke to help others. These people, says the government, aren't eligible for much care related to their injuries. After having been constantly lauded as heroes for months after the attacks, many of the first responders were ignored, left to fend for themselves as their health slipped further and further. One man - a man who risked death to help strangers - has two bad lungs and must cart around a breathing apparatus to survive; he can't even sleep on his back or stomach, because he just can't breathe.\nThe only true instance of bombast on the part of Moore is when he takes a few of these 9/11 workers to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to receive the same level of medical treatment as the \"enemy combatants\" in the prison. He's denied, of course, so he traverses Havana for help and easily finds it. An inhaler that costs one of the 9/11 workers over a hundred dollar - when several are needed monthly - costs under one dollar in Cuba. Same inhaler, same medicine for a fraction of the cost.\nI realize that even though this is a documentary, Moore does have an agenda to push, as he does with all of his films. But what is his motivation? Is it merely to poke fun at big, bloated insurance companies and the government? Or is it to raise awareness of a national crisis? Moore's point isn't that health care should definitively be offered to everyone for free, it's just that there are a huge number of people in America who are actually covered but can't get proper medical treatment. It's a national disgrace, Moore implies, and he's precisely right. Understandably, we often have to throw money at war machines to gain a political edge, but in doing so we tend to completely neglect the sheer humane practice of making sure everyone has the opportunity to get well."}

OK, maybe traumatizing. I had a LASIK procedure done a couple of years ago, and although I wasn't blind beforehand, I did have pretty bad eyesight. I know a bit about the trepidation - perhaps even outright terror - one feels before undergoing an operation on one's eyeballs. I still get a little skeeved when I see a closeup of eyes, come to think of it.\nJessica Alba plays Sydney, a blind concert violinist who has a double corneal transplant, and of course things go wrong. Not with the surgery itself, but with the psychological aftermath - she sees dead people. And dead things. And undead. And so on; it looks like she's tapped into a spiritual world, or something. No one else can see what she's seeing, which is par for the course in movieland, but all of the demons and smoke and fire and other sfx seem extremely, utterly, real to Sydney.\nAlba is excellent, showing that she has more than just two (or three) talents to show the world. Her Sydney is appealing in her vulnerability; Alba, a beautiful young woman, manages to make you feel as if her character could, indeed, live in your world: less glitzy starlet, more three-dimensional person. Of course, she's still a knockout, and she IS a supremely talented musician, and she DOES live in a super-posh apartment in a high rise, but still. Alba shows wonderful range, from tender to fragile, without giving up any sincerity. The movie hinges on her ability to sell the audience on her character's Everywoman (to a point) status, and I think she delivers.\nSome of you may be thinking you've already seen this movie before, when it was called Blink. In Blink, Madeline Stowe played a young woman who lost her sight as a child (as did Sydney) and then grew up to be a talented violinist; after a new eye operation temporarily restores some sight, she sees things. Just like Sydney. Huh. Still, this isn't a redo of Blink, it's a remake of a Chinese film called Gin gwai. Asian films have made the rounds of Hollywood in recent years (The Ring, The Grudge, Dark Water), and although the remakes usually don't have the subversive bite of their original counterparts, some of them hold up rather well when inundated with high-tech CGI. The Eye does use special effects, but it uses them - pardon me - to great effect; you're not overwhelmed with attention-grabbing CGI.\nThe biggest debit in the movie is the love interest, Sydney's doctor, Paul (Alessandro Nivola), who seems dull and unimportant, although his believing in and trusting Sydney is a linchpin for moving the plot. He just seems vacant and stiff, hardly a commendation of Nivola's acting abilities. (Think of a younger Dylan McDermott.) On the other hand, a good counterbalance to Nivola is Parker Posey as Sydney's concerned sister, who, although she doesn't immediately buy into Sydney's rantings, does empathize and attempt to understand a bit better than the hunky doctor.\nOverall, The Eye is a tense, shudder-filled movie that manages to dress up a recycled plot with dead-on performances and evocative cinematography."}
< {"rating": "8", "date": "20 January 2008", "title_id": "tt0765443", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "Promise well kept", "content": "Any time a new movie is shot in black and white, people use adjectives like \"stark\" and \"realistic\" to describe it. Sometimes they'll combine the two: \"stark realism\" and so forth. The style is supposed to be evocative of grittier, dirtier times (can anyone imagine a colorized Grapes of Wrath?), times when people kept on keepin' on as best they could while dealing with the harsh realities of daily life.\nThe black and white cinematography in David Cronenberg's Eastern Promises compares and contrasts the everyday lives of middle-class Londoners with the raw, terror-fueled violence of expatriate Russian gangsters. Additionally, as in other, earlier movies, the truly bloody moments are made all the scarier because of the lack of color; everything feels realer while still seeming authentic. (Not an easy feat; for ultrarealism that seems insincere, try reality television.) A midwife named Anna (Naomi Watts) helps deliver a baby to an unidentified young girl who dies during childbirth; Anna, being a Good Samaritan, decides to try to discover the girl's family, so that the newborn can live with them instead of slipping away into the red-tape-ridden foster-care system. Aided by a diary found in the girl's handbag, Anna winds up at a Russian restaurant owned by Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), who promises to help Anna in her quest by translating the diary from Russian to English.\nMeanwhile, a lower-level employee of Semyon named Nikolai (a sensational Viggo Mortensen) is slowly moving his way up the ladder of Semyon's empire, which is of course not wholly invested in restauranting. Nikolai is one of those marvelously inscrutable figures who knows far more than what he says, which is precious little, in contrast - there's that word again - with Semyon's own son, Kirill (an equally wonderful Vincent Cassel), who is boisterous, petulant, and covetous. The film manages to make its audience question Nikolai's intentions and loyalties; is he merely in this murderous racket for his own gain? Steven Knight's screenplay is tight, coarse, and even a bit gruesome; it's definitely not for the weak of stomach or heart. (A dead man's fingers are removed in a very early scene, for one thing, and there's an extended fight scene involving a nude Mortensen in a steam bath.) As with any other suspense thriller worth its salt, there are plenty of plausible twists and turns - but none can be easily foreseen, and they aren't simply strung together as red herrings designed to just continually shock the audience, which is the sort of thing a younger Cronenberg might have attempted.\nAll four leads are terrific; Watts is an improvement over Maria Bello, who costarred with Mortensen in Cronenberg's A History of Violence (maybe he's got something for cute young blonde actresses). But this isn't one of those innocent-young-heroine-saves the day movies, either. You know the ones. The girl with seemingly no talents, smarts, or powers somehow defeats a tough, organized opponent using only her womanly wiles and spunkiness. No, not here. Anna is intelligent and resourceful, yes, but the real conflict isn't between her and the evil Russian mafia, it's a conflict within the crime family itself. The dichotomy between Nikolai, the outsider becoming the boss's favorite, and Kirill, the son at war with his own inner demons, is richly detailed with a modicum of dialog (mostly Kirill's). Cassel and Mortensen are so wonderful together, you almost think that their characters ARE brothers instead of one being naturally superior (by birthright) to the other.\nCronenberg's come a long way since making slasher pics in Canada (this is, in fact, the first of his movies that was filmed entirely outside of Canada); it's as if he woke up a few years ago and decided he wasn't going to make any gross-out pics like The Fly, Rabid, Scanners, or Dead Ringers. Coupled with A History of Violence, Eastern Promises is raw, energetic, and stunningly filmed."}

When it first hit theaters, The Blair Witch Project, was a welcome change from the almost-antiseptic approach that directors were taking to movies; most scary action movies seemed almost too stagy, too unreal, to implausible. Blair Witch used a hand-held camera and was marketed as lost, recovered footage of an experience in the woods gone awry.\nHere in 2008, though, the anarchic, subversive idea of hand-held, intentionally amateur cinematography is almost passe', isn't it? Since 1999, audiences have seen reality television shows and gritty, dirt-in-your-face movies that aim for an ultrareal effect; consequently, the novelty has worn off. We're no longer amused by footage we could have shot ourselves, and we're no longer automatically terrified when something scary is filmed with a camcorder.\nIn Cloverfield, a group of young people is throwing a going-away party in New York City for one of their own; Rob, who is assuming a high-paying job in Japan. Naturally, one of his best friends, Hud, videotapes the party, asking various guests to offer testimonials to Rob, sort of as one would do at a wedding reception. Then BOOM, there's a loud explosion, and the guests flip on the TV - looks like a giant something or other is attacking the city.\nBecause everything is seen through the camcorder that Hud is lugging around, we're supposed to feel a kinship with these pretty twentysomethings, although to be frank they look and act a little more like teenagers. Using Hud's camera, director Matt Reeves introduces us to a few characters who may or may not make it through to the end of the film. We're told very little about them, but it's quickly evident that the people on whom the camera does linger will be characters we'll follow after the tragedy strikes.\nOn the plus side, the monster is hardly seen at all, really just in shadows and the like, until near the very end of the movie, and no explanation is offered as to where it came from. The result of this, though, is that the focus is shifted to the game effort put forth by our survivors as they attempt an inexplicably dumb quest. The instant they decide that's what they're gonna do, you start guessing which of them will be killed off.\nAt any rate, such a focus means that it's pretty important that the actors themselves turn in strong, evocative performances, and no one here does. The impression one gets is that the actors were hired mainly because they weren't supertalented thespians, that producer J.J. Abrams was going for amateur-looking acting to go along with the amateur-looking camera-work. I get that, I really do, it's just that watching a 90-minute home movie isn't all that interesting when you can tell a lot of the special effects were done with CGI.\nThis movie represents some of the worst aspects of cinema verite. The haphazard, slapdash camera-work is, of course, how you or I might use a camcorder, so it's realistic; on the other hand, most people don't want to watch a homemade film to which they have no connection. If my friends had made this, I might have been into it a bit more, but the film never engages its audience. (The party is an obvious contrivance to attempt to engage us, but it just shows me a bunch of pretty young people acting like doofuses.) And because there are all of these zooms to the left and right and up and down and whoops here we go, falling and gasping, it's tough to make sense of what's going on. Sure, I know, that's how the characters feel, too - what's attacking us? Where should we go? What should we do? - but I am not the characters, and in this case, seeing things through their eyes just makes me dizzy and not care about them much at all.\nAnd that, dear friends, is the crux of the problem. The movie wants you to be right down there in the trenches with the characters, but to do that it's got to make you like the characters, root for them in some way, and it just plain fails to do so. Instead, we're treated to nearly 90 minutes of people running here and there and getting attacked by who knows what, and so forth (there are a LOT of shots of feet, as Hud's camera is pointed straight down a lot of the time). To put it simply, it's like watching any other loud, dumb action movie, only instead of excellent camera angles and world-class cinematography that grabs you by the throat and never lets go, you get some brain-damaged diphthong toting a home video camera like it's 1990 and he's at his first no-adults party.\nI initially thought that the long buildup to the monster attack itself was a bad idea in itself; we get endless shots of the party and the people in it, merely for exposition and empathy. \"Bring on the monster!\" I shouted, internally. And then the attack comes, and for the rest of the film you feel like you're on a roller coaster ride after having eaten fourteen hot dogs.\nCloverfield isn't worth the endless, smug, metahype it generated for itself leading up to its release. It means to be edgy and groundbreaking but winds up being tired and played out. The monster does look pretty cool, and some of the stunts are worth watching, and there are some genuine scares, but overall it misses its mark by quite a bit. The rolling head of the Statue of Liberty is clever, but that's about it for wit."}

Instead of a plot that takes plausible but largely unforeseeable left turns, Atonement's story is obvious, too blunt, and crackling with clich\u00e9. Everything, from the haphazard direction and editing to the numb acting, is a bit of an embarrassment to all involved.\nWildly overrated, Atonement is closer in style and scope to a Merchant-Ivory film, so if that's your cup of tea, you might like this one a little more than I did. But it's more like the dimwitted, held-back-in-school bastard child of such films, because although it contains all the proper hoity-toity attitude and pretty costumery, it has none of the subtlety or charm - in short, the characters are all largely unsympathetic, giving the audience no one to root for. This isn't always a deal breaker for me, but when the characters are dull, vapid, vacuous space takers, it does sort of put a damper on things.\nAt age 13, Briony (Saoirse Ronan) is a pretentious, self-possessed newbie writer. She's supposed to be a child prodigy of sorts, but she seems more perfunctory than imaginative (to be sure, we don't get much of a glimpse of her writing efforts at that age; it's merely implied how great she is). She harbors a crush on the handsome, strapping son (James McAvoy) of her wealthy family's housekeeper, who has long had eyes for Briony's older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley). On a hot summer day, Briony illicitly reads a note from Robbie (McAvoy) intended for Cecilia (gasp) and then later sees something she shouldn't have. Subsequently the girl swears to seeing something she definitely didn't see, her perspective colored by her feelings for Robbie and her interception of the note. This irrevocably alters the lives of all three, of course.\nThe movie jumps around quite a bit, timewise, which at one point was an interesting approach to film-making but more often than not nowadays seems sort of played out and unnecessary; here it's done to confuse the audience a little bit, some trickery thrown in to distract from the fact that the plot itself is fairly bland and melodramatic. Because of Briony's misinterpretation, Robbie winds up in prison and later in the military, fighting in WW II. Much of the film describes his attempts to get back to London to be with Cecilia. Cecilia, meanwhile, works as a waitress - a job that's a bit lower than her family's station should allow. Briony forgoes attending an exclusive writing academy and becomes a nurse, all owing to her guilt (not to mention her obstinacy).\nBut what does it all mean? That one person's sworn testimony can screw up the lives of somewhat-innocent people? Oh, there's news. In the end, it all feels like much ado about nothing. Has Briony truly atoned for her sin? Of course not. She didn't have the guts to say anything when she had the power to do so; to make herself feel better, she writes a novel over the course of the rest of her life. So, no real atonement, just a general sense of comfort and insincere assuaging of guilt.\nI think that's the crux of the issue here - the movie feels insincere. Are Robbie and Cecilia madly in love, or do they just want to have hot sex all the time? Little in the early half of the movie indicates the former, and plenty of evidence is shown for the latter. But even if they are in love\u0085 well, here is where the issue of What the Movie Is crops up; this is not a psychological thriller, it's a dopey romance movie. It's a chick flick, even with some truly garish and probably unnecessary war scenes. (Do we really need to see burn victims? How does this further the plot?) The script is even based on a romance novel, by Ian McEwan. If pining for lost loves sounds like a grand old time to you, by all means dive into this murky, tortured movie.\nAs for the casting, it's not terrible. Knightley, who has said she wants to play more mature roles, continues to look like a tall, bug-eyed boy, with her shapeless, bony figure. She's not a bad actress, but she might have been a little in over her depth here; at no point did I feel sympathy toward Cecilia, although she's supposed to be a victim here. McAvoy (The Last King of Scotland) looks a little more girlish here than Knightley does, what with his impossibly red lips, even in the war scenes.\nSo. If you're expecting a thick-plotted, twisty thriller about what happens when a lie spirals out of control, this is not the movie for you; if you like costume dramas with actors rising to their material, this is also not the movie for you; if you like love stories with no apparent happy ending and actors sinking to melodramatic depths, this is a winner."}

Now, Spider-Man is the hero of children across the city, so there's less reason to empathize with him, to identify our own uncoolness within Parker.\nThe problems with this movie are manifold. To begin with, the webslinger has far too many bad guys to face. First, there's the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), an escaped convict who fell into a particle accelerator and now has the properties of, well, sand. Then there's an alien parasite, conveniently falling from the sky so it can latch onto Peter and bring out the worst in his repressed personality. Then there's Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), a supremely vicious rival photographer. Oh, and Harry Osborn (James Franco), the son of the Green Goblin; he thinks Spidey killed his pop (he didn't), and he knows Peter is Spidey (oops). So you can imagine what's on Harry's mind.\nWith all of these villains, you'd think there'd be plenty of conflict. Clearly, however, the writers felt something else was needed, so they invented a highly contrived plot thread in which Peter (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane's (Kirsten Dunst) relationship disintegrates. It should be no surprise to you whatsoever that somehow this relationship gets resuscitated by movie's end. They're together! They're apart! They hate each other! They love each other! You'll hate them both! And what bugs me more than the obviousness, the sheer craptastic predictability of the relationship angle, is that both MJ and Peter act like completely selfish, rotten jerks to each other - and we're supposed to eat that up. Apparently, we're supposed to think, \"Hey, yeah, that's exactly how it is!\" Supporters of the movie might point to the fact that Peter's under Venom's control when he's treating MJ like garbage, but that's not true - he's a creep to her well before Venom shows up. He's smug, self-centered, clearly soaking up the adoration of the city like he was Donald Trump handing out low-income housing in Brooklyn. Okay, maybe not that smug, but still. Peter Parker, in this movie, behaves exactly opposite from what makes Peter Parker interesting to the rest of us in the first place - that he is an insecure dweeb who happens to have superpowers. A crass, smarmy punk is not appealing.\nThere's one telling scene - it was in the trailer, too - that shows Peter strutting down the street, wearing the Venom costume under his normal clothes, and every girl stops to stare at this supposed virile paragon of masculinity. Yeah, Peter Parker. The problem is that Tobey Maguire isn't much of an actor, and when he has to stray from the golly-gee innocent-lamb of Peter Parker, his inabilities are completely exposed. In short, he sucks ass. He can't carry a scene without putting on a mask and looking like he's swinging on some web-like substance. The casting of Maguire made sense originally, because he looks exactly like the kind of doofus nitwit you'd expect Peter Parker to be, but in this movie, when he has to be more than just that doofus, Maguire can't hack it.\nSpeaking of looking like he's swinging .... isn't the whole purpose of CGI to make awesome things look real? Remember back in the day when actors would be in a car, appearing to drive through a city, when it was obvious they were on a set with the city scene playing in the background? I mean, on the cheaper films, it was pretty clear what was going on. The CGI in this movie is a lot like that. When Spider-Man is swinging between buildings, it looks like they took Maguire jumping around and plopped it onto a city background. It looks terrible, and it's distracting.\nSo, let's recap. Too many villains (they should have stuck with Sandman and Harry), a shallow, ridiculous relationship, poor special effects, and bad acting, at least on Maguire's part. But hey, I can't blame him entirely - Sam Raimi's script turns Spider-Man into Emo Spidey - complete with stereotypical Goth haircut and dull monotone! And who knew that simply wearing the Venom costume could make one an accomplished jazz pianist and dancer? With all of these obvious inadequacies, you'd think that the door would finally be closed on this series, but since the movie did well, you can bet a S-M 4 will pollute the theaters sooner rather than later."}

A reporter (Lucy Liu) wakes up in a morgue's body drawer and discovers she's been changed into a blood-seeking, human-chomping immortal, or something, and rather than gleefully embrace her new self she decides to track down the evil bastards who put her in that condition, making her a sort of avenging angel for all those who have been similarly wronged.\nSadie Blake (Liu) is a sexy, classy young lady who's just written a front-page story about teen goth clubs. One of her coworkers, the nerdy computer stereotype, tracks down a phone number that one of the teens handed to Sadie - turns out it's not a phone number but the first in a series of clues that leads to a website devoted to some weird bloodsucking cult. Sadie, of course, thinks the story's over and goes on a quickie vacation to Mexico with her sister, but when she returns, you guessed it, her coworker's dead. Sadie follows clues like a good little Nancy Drew and winds up getting kidnapped (several times) and killed (several times), all to figure out who or what's behind everything.\nThe story jumps around a lot, flouting the conventions of time as we know them; things simply don't happen in the exact order we'd expect them to, which clouds Sadie's motives and intentions quite a bit. Is she good? Is she even human? After all, once she's been attacked by the vampire people, she's not exactly the picture of health, and she's gotta eat to survive. Is her ultimate goal of revenge enough to offset the unpleasant facts? It helps that there's a typically hissable bad guy, Bishop (James D'Arcy). He's eternal, of course, and he kills and mutilates and rapes for the sheer joy of it. There are no moral or ethical quandaries with this guy. Plus he has an effete, brandy-swilling British accent, making all the more unctuous and slimy. (Well, he's slimy also because he's often covered in someone's blood.) Now, granted, this isn't a pleasant, sedate movie to watch. It's full of gore and guts, although not so much as, say, a movie like Saw or Hostel. It's still not for the weak of stomach. You might remember how, in Kill Bill, The Bride traveled all over to wipe out those who'd wronged her - but the film didn't show us this in the order in which each avenging occurred, did it? So you'd see Uma Thurman wander over to Viveca Fox's house not knowing if she'd already visited Lucy Liu. Well, you would know, of course, if you picked up on the subtle hints, and that's exactly how it is here. At one point, Sadie runs into alcoholic, world-weary cop-with-a-conscience-and-a-cause Clyde Rawlins (a fantastic Michael Chiklis) and mutters something about having seen him before. And if you watch the movie closely, you see exactly where. It's as if there are no coincidences in the movie, and I think that works in its favor.\nStill, it IS just a revenge flick, albeit one with vampires and a kick-ass crossbow. Liu is very, very good - she's not the screaming, hands-in-the-air type of heroine, but she's also not the balls-out gut-stomping Lara Croft type, either. Remember, Lucy Liu is petite; she doesn't automatically have this intimidating screen presence, so she uses what she has and makes the most of it. In her case, I'd have to say it's her eyes, flashing terror or courage in.... well, in the blink of an eye.\nSo despite some predictability, the movie does work, thanks to Liu and the novelty of the disjointed sequencing. There are quite a few chills, and the plot doesn't stray too far from its main revenge thread, thus simplifying matters."}

Sure, this is the sixth or fourth in a rapidly declining series, and as the Law of Sequels tells us, the farther away from the first movie we get, the quality of each film decreases exponentially. Or proportionally. But I don't want to get all mathy on you.\nThe film before this showed the long-awaited pairing of the Aliens and the Predator, and for the most part the result was pretty compelling. This time around, in a scene reminiscent of the original Alien movie, an interloping alien emerges from the prone body of a Predator and attacks the crew, causing their spaceship to plummet to a little blue-green planet. Before you know it, alien face-huggers are implanting themselves into a hunter and his son and then birthing chest-bursters near a small, unsuspecting Colorado town.\nMeanwhile - and really germane to the plot - the Predators have sent another of their kind down to Earth to destroy any evidence of their crashed (and dead, apparently) and to eradicate the Aliens. Which is a pretty fair fight, since the Predator has a lot of big guns and can turn invisible, and the Aliens can spit acid and slap you about the face and head. Of course, humans get caught in the crossfire, as they did in the movie's immediate predecessor.\nThere are a lot of standard structures in this movie, such as the virginal (ahem) high school queen; the bad boy; the bad boy's older brother, who's an ex-con, and so on. People routinely wander into unlit areas for no reason other than to get slaughtered, and it's pretty clear from the git-go that the humans in this story are there merely to give us something to care about.\nBecause let's face it. The Predator is in his watery-invisible form for most of the movie, and the Aliens are dark, and they all fight in dark, dark areas. With no humans, no recognizable faces, we might as well be watching polar bears in a snowstorm. Not only that, but - as with the last film - the audience can get someone for whom to root, in this case, the ineffectual, victimized humans who fire what amount to BB guns at a Sherman tank. Remember the tagline from the last movie? \"Whoever wins, we lose?\" For the first couple thirds of the movie, the humans act stupid and/or dully, acting as mere befuddled targets than people you'd care about. Except, of course, for the people who would somehow make it to the final third of the movie. Don't worry, they're easy to pick out; everyone else is easy to pick off.\nAnd certainly, it wouldn't be a sci-fi movie without some kind of potential government cover-up/conspiracy/meddling; thankfully, that thread isn't introduced until well into the movie, which means we don't spend half the film with the specter of the Evil Government That's Out to Destroy Everyone. Good thing, because more enemies just complicates things.\nBottom line is that the final twenty minutes or so definitely make up for the lousy pacing and the lack of tension in the first hour. I mean, things were so bad that you could easily predict what would happen to a character you just met. Death scenes were telegraphed with a giant beacon that said \"PERSON DIES HERE. BLOOD SPURTS.\" And make no mistake, this is a grisly movie that delights in people getting slaughtered in fun and exciting ways, involving evisceration. Or getting poked in the eye or chest. Or flaying. And no groups are spared - not women, not children, and not even pregnant women. It's a real windfall for aficionados of equal-opportunity gore."}

Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) an almost-invisible Congressman in the 1980s who specializes in drinking and carousing, decides to push for the U.S. to aid the Afghanis, whose country has been invaded by the Soviet Union. Only they had to do it secret-like, you see, because the Cold War was ongoing at the time. Couldn't have the Russkies knowing we were arming their enemies, because then we'd be directly involved when we wanted to remain indirectly involved. You know, because of the nukes.\nWilson can't pull this off alone, of course, even if he's the chairman of the committee that funds the CIA's covert ops. The cool thing is that if Wilson asks for the budget to be increased, say, twofold, Congress sees only the amount, not the reasons underlying the increase. Even so, Wilson needs to schmooze and raise funds without blowing the cover; he's pushed and prodded into action by a woman who can help him, wealthy Texas socialite Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts). Herring, a devout Christian, wants to help the Afghani mujahedin to push back against the godless Communist invaders. Rounding out the team is the CIA's own rogue renegade rebel, Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), an iconoclast with the intelligence - if not the social graces - to help Wilson win his war.\nHanks turns in a pretty believable Texas twang and is a pretty good fit for the role, even when he uses profanity. I can't remember the last time I heard Tom Hanks say the F word or be in a hot tub with naked women. Oh, wait, it might have been Bachelor Party. Somehow, even the older Hanks pulls it off. Then there's Roberts, who's also somewhat acceptable in her role as the Texan matron - but who must have had an on-set stylist who absolutely detested her, because she got put in some of the worst wigs known to women. (Men in general have worse wigs, obviously.) I mean, it looked like a blonde muskrat died on her head. I shouldn't be too unkind, since the movie IS set in the 1980s, a decade infamous for its fashion choices, but the look was really awful for Roberts. And, as I mentioned, she's somewhat acceptable - if one looks past the fact that she's 40 playing someone considerably older but still looking like a 40 year old playing dress up.\nOutshining everyone, easily, was Hoffman. It's like the man doesn't even have to break a sweat to outact people anymore. He's even better than Hanks, who's kind of restricted by the type of role that Charlie Wilson is - a fun-lovin' Man in Charge. Supporting characters, like Hoffman's Gust, often have more freedom to be wacky, offbeat, lovable curmudgeons. Hoffman's fantastic, hidden beneath Gust's bushy mustache and issuing bon mots; he steals the movie from the bigger stars (Oscar win notwithstanding) with a grumpy, energetic performance.\nAll in all, Charlie Wilson's war is simply okay, a decent biopic about a man and situation unfamiliar to most people. It's helped quite a bit by its superstar cast (and direction by Mike Nichols), but it's not interesting enough to warrant much attention. When Hanks, Roberts, and Hoffman have retired from acting, this movie will appear only as a blip, a footnote in otherwise memorable careers."}

It's got the profane violence of Blood Simple, the wry wit of Raising Arizona, and the tight plotting of Fargo - not to mention outstanding performances by Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, and Tommy Lee Jones. And it culminates in a big finish that'll either leave you wanting more or simply cold.\nThe plot is fairly straightforward. A hunter named Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon the scene of a drug deal gone really, really sour. Dead bodies, including a dog. Shot up trucks. A huge stash of drugs. And, at the end of a bloody trail, a dead man and a satchel with $2 million in cash. Now, what would you do in that situation? You're armed, but who knows who's out there in the wilderness, looking for their lost loot? If you're Mr. Moss, you amscray the heck out of there.\nOf course, someone's gonna come looking for that money, and that person is a crazy bastard named Chigurh (Javier Bardem), who has a penchant for killing and absolutely no moral compass to speak of. He wants something, he kills you and takes it. Or takes it and kills you. Either way. Chigurh is single minded, but he's by no means a simple man; he's whip smart and blindingly fast with his gun and his feet. There's something about Chigurh that separates him from every other killer who wants his money back; its intangible, and it's all because Bardem is so perfect in the role. His sad eyes belie an absolutely terrifying, methodically maniacal criminal.\nCompleting the trifecta is a beleaguered, world-weary sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones). Sheriff Ed Tom Bell is to No Country for Old Men as Marge Gunderson was to Fargo; the no-nonsense, superclever, seasoned Johnny Law who tries desperately to piece together the puzzle before every character has been murdered, a la Shakespeare. This is a role Jones was made to play, and I can safely say he turns in the finest, most nuanced and sincere performance of his long career. Jones has the countenance of a leathery cowpoke as it is, and the unique drawl to accompany it, and the beautiful, poignant script (also by the Coen brothers) allows him to really show his stuff.\nMake no mistake, though, in spite of its subtleties, this is a very violent movie; many painful, gut-wrenching deaths occur. Still and all, one thing that makes the movie work is that the violence seems real, not comic-book style; it's not violence without serious repercussions.\nBack to the writing. At times during the film, multiple story lines are in motion, a la Pulp Fiction, and everything moves so seamlessly that it's only later, in retrospect, that you recall certain aspects that tie in one character's perspective with that of another. A mediocre screenwriter would have trouble with this, and plot holes the size of the Rio Grande itself would emerge. People would laugh about the plot inaccuracies and overall inadequacies.\nAnd then, finally, there's that ending. Some people will absolutely love the ending, but others will stare at the screen for a few minutes, wondering if there's more to the story. Simply put, not everything is explicitly resolved, so if you're the kind of person who must have everything tied up as if in a 30-minute sitcom, you're going to have an issue or two with the finale. There was a bit of silence in the theater in which I saw this movie, but I didn't get the impression it was the angry \"THAT'S IT??\" kind, just the surprised kind."}

Well, against those who'd attack if they knew where he lived. Which they don't, really. And Neville has it made, at least in terms of resources. He has generators for electricity, so he can cook his own food (and for his dog, Sam). He has great security. He can watch movies to his heart's content. But after three years, he's more than a little lonely - he's beginning to go crazy. (He's even positioned mannequins in the video store so he can \"converse\" with them each day.) We have a vague idea of what caused 99% of the Earth's population to die, but the movie's more concerned with the aftermath; how Neville survives, and how he lost his family. (Hint: It's not because of the plague.) And this is where the strength of Will Smith comes into play. Until recently, Smith was mostly Action Guy - Independence Day, Bad Boys, I, Robot, and so on - and basically thrived on dopey catch phrases. Good news! There are no catch phrases in this movie. In fact, Smith has to actually emote and act, and damn if he doesn't do an exemplary job. Remember when Tom Hanks chatted up a volleyball? Same sorta thing, only Smith's talking to his German Shepherd; he needs to in order to keep hold of the tenuous gossamer strands of his slippery sanity.\nWhen he's not out gathering provisions and scouting for people, Neville is busy in his basement lab, trying desperately to reverse the virus and cure everyone. I'm not sure about the science angle of this, but since Neville himself is immune, he figures he can inject one of the zombie creatures with his blood, but that doesn't work. So he keeps at it, adding things, taking away things. It's all very scientific.\nSmith's beautiful, evocative performance is among the best he's ever given, about on par with the maudlin The Pursuit of Happiness; I Am Legend is an action movie that doesn't smack you over the head every five seconds with, well, more action; it instead builds suspense and then pays off. Multiple times. One reason this works is that director Francis Lawrence employed a hand-held camera during many of the more violent scenes, and it's usually a pretty effective method - it's just that sometimes the zigzagging is a little jarring. Still, not a big problem.\nThere are some differences between this movie and the original story, but they're not bad differences, exactly; an example of a story being updated while not being demonstrably altered. And here's another plus - although you do get to see the creatures - and they're pretty nasty looking - you don't see them often enough to get used to them, or their hideous screeches, or their no-holds-barred, uninhibited, visceral behavior."}

The effects are excellent, as Hollywood strangely (and wisely!) decided to ease off the overproduced special effects for a change, and the result is that when we do see the creatures, we're suitably terrified, especially since the camera never lingers long on any of them.\nThe basic setup is that a storm of the century has shut down the power in a small New England town, and the next morning a thick mist is rolling across the town's large lake. Dave Drayton (Thomas Jane) gathers his eight-year-old son and, accompanied by his caustic neighbor Brent Norton (Andre Braugher), heads to the supermarket to load up on groceries. When they get there, they find that pretty much everyone else in town has the same idea. And it seems like just the usual bad-weather madness until a local citizen bursts into the store, blood on his chest, screaming about how creature from the mist took his friend, and dadgum it everyone better GET INSIDE CLOSE THE DOOR AAAH THEY'RE COMING, and sure enough, as the doors are closed, the mist comes rolling in, and people stay the heck where they are. \nBut it soon becomes apparent that this is no ordinary mist, and that old man might have been on to something - something IS out there, but the mist is so thick no one can tell what it is. And that's where the story really gets under your skin. What manner of creature is outside the store's walls? Is it faster than a man trying to get to his car? Is it small, but vicious? Or is it gigantic? Is it even benign? (No, it's not.)\nIn other, less-deft hands, a story like this would have been a typical monster movie, as our Intrepid Hero saves the world from sure destruction. But this isn't about man versus the monster, it's about man versus the unknown - and man versus man. \nAlmost all of the action takes place inside the supermarket. There are level-headed (but scared) people, like Dave, Amanda Dumfries (Laurie Holden), Ollie (Toby Jones), and Irene (Frances Sternhagen), and then there are the so-scared-they're-irrational people, like Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) and Jim Grondin (William Sadler), and Norton. In a lesser movie, the theme would be that all of them must work together in order to survive, but that theme isn't given a chance here, as would be the case in real life. There's no rousing speech about how everyone's in this together; people become unhinged and unwilling to listen to reason at the drop of a hat, because the unknown of the mist is too much to bear.\nThat's where Mrs. Carmody comes in. She's a Bible-thumping fanatic of the Old Testament, and she sees the mist and its denizens as a sign from the Almighty, and as the movie progresses she becomes more and more like a seer to the easily swayed - and sees herself as a righteous martyr who will someday sit beside God. In other words, a disaster like the mist gives a kook like Mrs. Carmody the perfect opportunity to save souls, whether they want to be or not, and her zeal gives the lesser-minded individuals something they can hold on to, rather than using their minds for practical survival.\nDave acts as the de facto leader of the survivors, mostly because no one else steps forward, not even the three almost-on-leave soldiers trapped in the store. But not only must he find a way to get out of the store and past the creatures, but he has to deal with the escalating insanity of Mrs. Carmody, whose rantings attract a larger and larger congregation, ending in tragedy.\nThe only real issue I have with the movie is the ending, which differs wildly from that in King's original printed story. You would think that a Hollywood ending would be more tangible, thus giving the viewer better closure. Well, we do get some closure, but the result is that you feel like you've been kicked in the stomach. The finale is so unsatisfying, you wonder what the heck the preceding two hours were supposed to be for."}

But then it was changed to The Ex, which shifted the focus from the workplace to the home. But let's get this straight: Either name is infinitely better then the unhealthy dollop of mean-spirited junk that appears after the title card on the screen.\nTom (Zach Braff) has been fired from his job as a chef at a hoity-toity restaurant, so he and his wife Sofia (Amanda Peet) and their newborn baby schlep from New York to Ohio, where Sofia's dad Bob (Charles Grodin) has not only set Tom up with a new job but also has procured a nice little house for them to raise their new family in. Aww, ain't that sweet. But things don't start off well for Tom at the marketing firm, which turns out to be both new age and, well, wacko. You know, a place where such \"creative\" aspects as casual dress, unwalled offices, an imaginary ball of ideas or something abound. Tom has some issues with fitting in with the eclectic, quirky crew, but more importantly he clashes immediately with his new supervisor, Chip (Jason Bateman), who just happens to be a former schoolmate of Sofia. Oh, and a paraplegic, of course.\nBut don't worry; although it seems like this is a romantic comedy about jealousy and redemption, about a young couple getting past their differences to survive as a unit, it's set up to be more like a slapstick comedy, with many jokes at Chip's expense. (Which is okay, because Chip is a real jerk.) The sad reality, though, is that the movie fails at both genres. Women won't like it, because there's no real romance, no genuine feelings on anyone's part. (Sorry to generalize, ladies.) Guys won't like it, because there's not nearly enough physical humor. That would be fine, except there's hardly any subtle humor, either. What you're left with is just vicious, mean-spiritedness that drains every ounce of humor from an otherwise talented cast.\nBraff's not terrible, but I never got the sense that he was, well, believable as someone women would desire. But what do I know, I'm a straight male. The affection between him and Peet seemed forced, tentative, and unnatural, sort of like unwilling siblings. Peet wasn't bad, either, but she didn't have much to work with - on a positive note, she doesn't come off as icily unappealing as she does in most of her other films.\nAnd man, check out Charles Grodin. I had to check to see who was playing Sofia's dad - Grodin, who hadn't been in a movie in 13 years, looks about 85 years old here. I thought he was Bob Eubanks. There's one scene, too, in which Bob utters the f-word. For no freaking reason other than to have Charles Grodin, septuagenarian, drop an f-bomb.\nInterestingly enough, the unrated version of the movie runs about five minutes shorter than the rated one that was seen in theater. And, having seen the unrated one, I couldn't tell you about any particular scenes that were so raw that they would have pushed the rating to an unwanted NC-17. So I have to assume that the rated one was even tamer, and thus even crappier.\nSad and predictable in its attempt at comedy, The Ex is a waste of time. You'll be clawing your eyes out at the numbing awfulness."}

Too bad director Robert Redford didn't apply the same sort of balls-out approach to this film, because what we're left with seems more like a commercial, either for the armed forces, the starched-shirt suits who run wars from their armchairs, or the pompous professors who presume to know everything. Bah to all of it, I say.\nThe movie's told in three intertwining parts. In one, a college professor (Redford) talks with one of his many apathetic students (Andrew Garfield) about idealism and acting on principles and doing something, even if it is destined for failure, instead of doing nothing at all. To illustrate his overreaching, heavy-handed points, Redford's Malley talks about two previous students of his (Michael Pena, Derek Luke) who left the friendly confines of college life to enlist in the current Iraq war.\nIn the second story, Irving grants an interview to Roth (an hour long one-on-one session, exactly mirroring the professor-student talk) in which he will lay out his grand new plan to retake Afghanistan from the Taliban. For Irving, the interview is a way for him to resell the war to the American public through the use of a very-willing American press. For Roth, it's a way to get information that no one else in the ultracompetitive media world will have, as it's an exclusive interview. But who is using whom? Redford wants us to believe that the press is being used by the government, but that's hardly news; he would also prefer that we think that Roth, representing the media, understands now how much of a shill she and her colleagues have become, but Roth's actions in that direction come much, much too late in the movie. She certainly should have been pushing Irving a lot harder than she was; instead, she seemed content to sit back and ask the occasional probing question. The underlying effect of this is that Irving's neocon senator gets to make a long, barely contested speech about saving the world from terror is awesome, and by golly if you don't agree then you must hate freedom, and blah blah blah. Such posturing would make some sense if any of the jingoistic points made by Irving were addressed, even refuted, but no. For some reason Redford just lets the words hang out there.\nThe third story involves Malley's two former students, now Special Forces rangers in the middle of the new operations launched by Irving. For much of the movie, they're trapped behind enemy lines, one very badly injured, the other trapped in a snowbank, with Taliban members closing in. They don't know if their fellow soldiers can get to them in time. In the closing moments of the film, one of them makes a decision so disturbingly stupid that it negates all the evidence seen to that point that the two former students had any kind of wits or intelligence about them.\nWatching this movie, you can't help but feel like Redford is smacking you across the head with a 2 x 4, screaming that we need to stand up or fall down or some such emptyheaded nonsense. Like Jasper Irving, Redford's film offers no ideas, no real food for thought; he's selling us an vague concept as political theater. Lions for Lambs is a gelatinous dessert, full of sound, half-empty with fury, and signifying nothing new."}

Baxter (Steve Carell) has been elected to Congress as a New York representative, leaving Buffalo and his old job as news anchor behind (as we last saw him, in Bruce Almighty). He's schlepped his prettier-than-he-deserves wife (Lauren Graham) and his three sons down to Washington. Shortly after he arrives there, though, God (Morgan Freeman) appears to him and tells him to build an ark.\nWhy, you ask? Why, to drive the plot, of course. Back in ye olden times, Noah was told to build an ark so that when God flooded the planet, the humans and the animals could repopulate. That's not quite the scope of the task at hand here, though we don't find that out till near the end of the movie.\nBuilding an ark in this day and age is disconcerting enough, but Evan has ancillary problems. He prides himself on his appearance, but lo and behold, once God has Spoken to Evan, he notices he can't shave in the morning. Or anytime. The beard grows right back. His hair also begins to grow at an alarming rate. And pairs of animals, from gophers to birds, are following him everywhere. Not a good turn of events if you're a freshman congresscritter.\nNaturally, no one believes that God has spoken to Evan, thus making for awkward moments when a powerful congressman (a hammy John Goodman) wants Baxter to cosponsor some kind of land rights bill, and every time he runs into Evan he sees animals and hair. Bad impression! Not that the movie's completely lacking in cleverness, however. Evan's wife is Joan (Joan of Arc, get it?); the Baxters' realtor is Eve Adams (an annoying Molly Shannon) (Eve, Adam, get it?); God His Own Darn Self wears a name tag when he appears to Joan that says \"Al Mighty.\" Oh, and the company that drops off the wood that Evan's supposed to use to build the ark is the \"Go 4 Wood\" company. Because the original ark was supposedly made of gopher wood.\nFor the most part, the movie is pretty formulaic. No one believes him, especially his family. Then they sort of do, but no one else does. Then people ridicule him while he builds the arc. Then the flood happens, and suddenly everyone's a True Believer. Har. Oh, and then there's the obligatory sideplot of the supposedly nice politico who's actually up to dirty tricks. In Washington, of all places! I know! Carell isn't too bad, and neither is his supporting cast, and that may actually be the problem - they're just \"not bad\" instead of \"pretty good.\" This isn't a movie you'll remember in a few years, in other words, except when you think of movies that had pretty good CGI scenes (check out the flood!). Freeman is as smooth as you'd expect Morgan Freeman to be, really, and there's no one else who could have done a better job than he did. But really, everyone else in the movie was sort of bland and could have been replaced by another, similarly innocuous actor. (Except Wanda Sykes, who plays Evan's executive assistant - she could be replaced by someone who's not a major irritant.) The end does compensate for an otherwise grayscale movie, with a wonderful staging of The Flood. Except, you know, on a much smaller scale, which sort of undermines the whole idea of The Flood in the first place. In Bruce Almighty, God wanted Bruce (and HIS not-understanding girlfriend, Jennifer Aniston) to gain understanding. Here, He's asking Evan to solve a political/social crisis. Bruce Almighty, it turned out, taught us about free will; Evan Almighty teaches us that if you put your mind to it, you can achieve anything. Evan Almighty's overall message just doesn't feel as all-encompassing or rich as that of Bruce Almighty, which makes it feel a little flat."}

But although some of the jokes are pretty good, and the performances are mostly spot-on, the film's pretty uneven; the funny parts are mostly funny, but the so-called sincere parts come off as maudlin or treacly.\nBen (Seth Rogen) is the slacker/stoner in question here. He and his not-all-there buds (ha! check out the double meaning) are in the process of launching a website dedicated to finding nudity in mainstream movies. If you immediately said, \"What, like Mr. Skin?\" you're in the target audience. So basically, Ben has no job, and neither do the rest of the man-children in his posse.\nContrary to that is Alison (Katherine Heigl of Grey's Anatomy), an E! entertainment producer-type who's just been given a shot at working in front of the camera. So she heads out to a club with her sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) and winds up hooking up with Ben. Of course, she was drunk at the time - Heigl is a pinup model and Rogen is a fat slob. So you know it's sort of true to life in that sense.\nFast forward eight weeks later, and Alison's preggers. Whoopsie daisy. Now how will these two lustbirds reconcile the fact that they don't really know each other with this impending birth? Or, for that matter, the fact that while sober neither has anything in common with the other? As I said, scenes that are supposed to be funny usually work, because Rogen is just doofy enough to pull it off; the film works when it pokes fun at Ben's slacker proclivities or the idiosyncrasies of his friends. It doesn't work so much in the way the women are portrayed, however. Look, we've all enjoyed movies in which women are mere objects, right? Porky's, I'm looking at you! Done right, that sort of approach can be raucously entertaining. But in this movie, the womenfolk alternately come off as wildly bitchy or just humorless. Alison was never really shown to have much of a sense of humor (although there's one scene in which she helps the boys spot nude scenes in films for their website).\nThat's all well and good regardless, because some movies can manage to have \"bad\" female characters off of which the males can play. But that's where the schizophrenia of this movie comes into play; is it a low-brow, misogynistic comedy or a relationship movie? Too often, it opted for the latter, and if you're trying to show the trials and tribulations of two crazy kids who aren't even in love with each other, you shouldn't make one of them unlikable and irrational. Even if, you know, that's how it'd be in real life.\nJudd Apatow, who brought us similarly flawed The 40 Year Old Virgin, compares the burgeoning Ben-Alison relationship to the marriage of Debbie and Pete. Oops, looks like Pete's an inconsiderate jerk! Looks like Debbie's an overreacting, hyperactive nitwit! Of course, Apatow's not saying theirs is the ideal relationship for which Ben and Alison should strive, but he makes it seem as if just having an relationship is a bad idea.\nAnd I know I might be in the minority here, but I've never liked humor that serves only to humiliate someone. So when Ben or Alison launches a profanity-laced attack on the other, that's not funny. It's not even entertaining. It's annoying.\n(Another recurring theme was that Debbie feels unappreciated. Check out the scene in which she and Alison are turned away from a club - Alison because she's pregnant and Debbie because she's, um, old. Leslie Mann is two years younger than me, it should be noted; anyway, the scene is presumably supposed to show the sisters bonding over their respective rejections, but all it did was show Debbie as whiny.) One plus, though - good to see Alan Tudyk (Wash from Firefly) getting some work; here, he's Alison's boss. His rotten-bitch-sycophant assisant has to go, though. She, like some of the other secondary and tertiary characters, was just thoroughly obnoxious and useless - not funny in the biting, sarcastic way, just caustic and off-putting."}

Jever notice?", "content": "Back in olden times, a B movie was one that was filmed largely on the backlot of a particular studio - that is, the kind of movie that had few, if any, known actors and that received little, if any, real promotion or hype. These were low budget, low-impact movies.\nBut the similarity between those B movies and Bee Movie is purely nominal. Look! Big stars! Lots of hype? Is it worth the 90 minutes of your time to put up with a theater full of squealing youngsters, even if you yourself have no children and in fact are quite conspicuous? Short answer - yes! Jerry Seinfeld (who also co-wrote) is Barry B. Benson, a worker bee who just wants to fly away from the hive and see what's out there in the great big world; he doesn't want to be tied down to the same ol' monotonous job with Honex, making honey. Which is what bees do. No, he wants to fly, explore, live! His best pal Adam (Matthew Broderick), is a bit more conservative and openly embraces the long, dull office job that awaits him, and he tries in vain to dissuade Barry from acting on his dreams. Ah, but to no avail; once Barry flies out with the Pollen Jocks, bees who, well, collect the pollen the bees use to make honey, he sees those dreams fulfilled. But such a journey isn't a cakewalk, nosir, it's fraught with danger, as Barry gets caught in a car's engine, along with other mishaps, eventually finding his way to a windowsill outside the apartment of one Vanessa Bloome (Rene Zellweger), who saves him from being splattered by her friends.\nSo it's your typical bee-meets-girl movie. Oh yes, I went there for that silly pun.\nNow, things are tough enough for Barry as he tries to win over Vanessa while jousting (verbally and physically) with her beau, Ken (Patrick Warburton, who's terrific as always) and dealing with his overprotective and not-completely understanding parents (Kathy Bates and Barry Levinson) when he learns that - gasp! - humans EAT honey. Honey that the bees make! After a little investigating, Barry sees with his own eyes how honey is harvested by humans from manmade hives populated by drugged-out bees - and he decides to sue the human race for stealing the bees' honey! And what had been a quirky love story (look! interspecies romance!) now becomes a little-man-versus-the-big-conglomerate plot line, and to tell the truth I felt a little guilty siding with the little guy. Barry takes the major corporations to court, and they're represented by the oleaginous Layton T. Montomgery (John Goodman), who lays on the good-ol-boy thicker than, well, you can guess. Can Barry and the bees stand up to Monty and the humans? With Oprah Winfrey as the judge, how can he go wrong? But wrong he does go, and that's as far as I'll take this plot summary.\nBee Movie is everything you want to see in an animated movie. It's inventive and creative (check out how detailed the hive operations are, or even Vanessa's apartment, or the courtroom), it's believable, and it's utterly charming. An animated movie HAS to be charming, too, because otherwise we adults would see it as just some dopey kids movie, wouldn't we? Seinfeld is winning and sincere as the bee with a cause, even when - especially when - things don't work out the way he expects them to. Bee Movie has a lot of heart, with a perfect, cheery ending."}

Although it's told in a straightforward manner, Planet Terror allows the viewer to enjoy the nostalgia theme ironically, with just enough creeps and scares to be viewed as a honest-to-goodness horror thriller.\nSeems some kind of noxious nerve gas that changes those who breathe it into flesh-eating zombies has been unleashed into the air at a military base (helpfully called \"Military Base\" on road signs). The army can't help - they might be behind it! So who can save the day? Why, a motley crew of citizens from a nearby town, of course, including a stripper who's just quit her job (Rose McGowan), a tow-truck-driving loner (Freddy Rodriguez), an honest sheriff (Michael Biehn), and a domestically abused doctor (Marley Shelton). Somehow, they must eradicate just enough of the mindless drones to escape to a better clime and find out how to keep the disease from spreading further. Can they do it? Yes they can! \nAs with most Robert Rodriguez movies, there's a lot of style AND substance to go around. For one thing, the movie's very well filmed, from the seamy lighting surrounding J.T.'s Bone Shack to the orderly madness of the local hospital. Heck, even the music sounds authentic, like the producers spent $20 to grab a few songs off of iTunes. Which brings me to the same conundrum I experienced with Death Proof: Why, if these are supposed to be homages to old-time crapfests from the 1970s or so, are there so many nods to modern living? I mean, why not go whole hog and have the movie actually SET in the 1970s? Wouldn't that have made more sense? \nEh, doesn't matter too much. Little anachronisms may be an irritant, but the movie's so well put together that you likely won't even notice or mind. Plus, Rodriguez makes up for that - and then some - by mischievously releasing the movie as if it had a missing reel (a reel that was never filmed, it should be noted). Oh, it's priceless. Freddy Rodriguez, as El Wray, is in the middle of coupling with his ex-ex-now-maybe-on-again, Cherry (McGowan) when the film appears to melt and perhaps fall off the reel; the viewer then sees a title card apologizing for the delay, and then POW, we're back in the movie, well further along than when we'd left it. (Humorously, the sheriff thanks El Wray later on for revealing his true identity and calling to the lawman; El Wray nods and tells the sheriff to keep it under his hat. Nudge nudge, wink, wink!) \nBut see, this isn't just about a stripper with a heart of gold warding off hordes of zombies; it's about a legless stripper with a heart of gold. See, early on, Cherry was sideswiped by a transport vehicle as she walked along the side of the road. She somehow caught the disease the zombies would later get, but she was \"saved\" when the good doctors chopped off the offending and infected leg. Heck, for part of the movie she has a table leg wedged into her metal stump, but later on? Later on she gets a machine gun there. Now THAT'S badass! She's a lithe stripper, you see, able to bend and twist and fire the gun wherever she wants. That Cherry, she has quite the assets, doesn't she? \nMcGowan and F. Rodriguez are both great, and so's the well-picked supporting cast, including Biehn as the intrepid sheriff and Jeff Fahey as his brother, a restaurateur. Oh, and Michael Parks, who's played the same kindly Texas Ranger Earl McGraw, who's been in both Kill Bill films and Tarantino's Death Proof, not to mention From Dusk Till Dawn (also directed by Rodriguez), and he's wryly amusing here. Heck, Bruce Willis appears unbilled, too. Tarantino's in it as well; he's actually half-decent as an actor, although his turn in Death Proof was a bit more entertaining.\nIn all, Planet Terror serves as a grimy reminder of just how deservedly unsung those cranked-out crapfests were back in the day, back when you'd pay a nickel for a double feature, and that included popcorn, by gum! The characters are appropriately shallowly written, although often the actors add just enough depth to make the movie worthwhile, even nonironically."}
< {"rating": "8", "date": "31 October 2007", "title_id": "tt1028528", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "Slightly anachronistic but still good trash", "content": "Grindhouse was originally released in theaters as one big movie comprising two feature-length parts, complete with fake trailers, that evoked the cheap and cheesy cinematic experience of low-budget movies in the olden days. However, each of the features was instead released separately on DVD, also in keeping with grindhouse theater tradition.\nDeath Proof, from Quentin Tarantino, relates the story of one Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), a movie stunt dude who's tricked out his kick-ass muscle car to be, well, death proof, meaning that it could be used as an actual stunt car, able to withstand high-velocity crashes without its driver sustaining much in the way of injuries. But see, Stuntman Mike isn't just some guy with a mean-looking car, he's also a sicko who gets off on killing young women. This is the kind of theme you'd see frequently in low-budget films of yesteryear - the sexy damsel in distress who's mowed down by a some psychopath with no greater motivation than sheer lunacy. Mike's a scary-looking fella, too - he has a long vertical scar that begins above his eye and travels down to his chin. He's gritty, slimy, grizzled. Heck, he kind of looks like Snake Plissken, come to think of it; all he's missing is that eyepatch.\nIn the first half of the movie, Mike stalks a group of young women, following them to a honkytonk bar. The women are luscious and oversexed, another theme of cheapo trash movies; eventually, Mike offers a lift to Pam (Rose McGowan), who's not even in the group he's been following. Do you think Pam will make it home in one piece? Yeah, I'm gonna go with \"no\" on that one, Johnny. Mike's car is death proof, indeed, but as he accurately notes, you get the full effect only if you're in the driver's seat. Hey-o! Anyway, death happens. There is a huge, wildly violent crash, as Mike uses his car as the ultimate murder weapon.\nOnce you accept the concept of the movie - that it's really supposed to be reminiscent of those crappy drive-in films of the past, complete with poor cinematography and editing - then you can somewhat enjoy the movie. I qualify that statement because there's one big problem I had with the movie, and that's while it should remind you of, say, a 1977 hot-rod/sexploitation movie, there are such curious anachronisms as cell phones and some late-model cars. There must be a logical explanation for this, but if we're supposed to think of those older movies and the primary vehicles in the movie are from the 1970s, then why have modern gadgets? Doesn't that sort of defeat the purpose a little? Russell is awesome as the diseased creep - he reminds me not only of Plissken but of Rondo Hatten, who played many seamy and seedy monsters back in the 1930s and 1940s. Stuntman Mike is a typical tough, hard-ass Tarantino character who can also use words to knock down an opponent - or win a lady. With a squint and a glint, Mike is instantly a mysterious rascal with an agenda, although the exact nature of that agenda isn't known until deeper into the film.\nThe rest of the cast is pretty good, although I do wish the entire atmosphere of the 1970s had been preserved; there was just too much modernity to the sets and the characters' mannerisms to suit me. The women we see in the latter half of the movie outshine those in the first half, particularly real-life stuntwoman Zoe Bell (playing herself, natch) and Rosario Dawson. Not faring as well were Vanessa Ferlito and Jordan Ladd.\nBeyond that little head-scratcher, though, the movie's not half bad. Were it not released as a big budget movie to such fanfare, it might even qualify for cult-movie status. Heck, it still might. The crash scenes are wonderful, pulse-quickening shots born of angst and revenge; you can almost feel the glass splintering, the metal bending, the rubber leaving a mile-long skidmark. This, along with pepper-hot dialog, is Tarantino's calling card - recall the crash scene in Pulp Fiction with Butch's car. Tarantino, typically, writes himself a good part as Warren the Bartender, although he didn't give himself a witty monologue like he did in Sleep with Me or even Pulp Fiction."}

This is one of those movies that fools you into thinking it\u2019ll be a pretty decent film, only to not only not be decent but to be hands-down one of the worst movies of the year. If I had a rating system of one to ten, with ten being the best, Bug would rate at about a negative infinity. But perhaps I\u2019m being a little harsh on it unnecessarily.\nBug is about a stereotypical lonely midwestern woman who lives in a crappy, run-down motel in the middle of Nowheresville, Oklahoma. She has the standard crazy ex-husband who\u2019s just been released from jail and the standard lesbian best friend who works with her at the honkytonk cowboy bar down the road a piece. Agnes (Ashley Judd) is kind, considerate, saucy, sassy, and gorgeous. Agnes is supposed to be sort of broken down; she has just her one friend R.C. (Lynn Collins) and doesn\u2019t like to party - although she does snort her share of the cocaine. Still and all, she seems like a right nice sort, although in typical Lifetime movie of the week fashion she\u2019s instantly cowed by her psychotic ex (Harry Connick, Jr.).\nOne day R.C. brings over a guy she found at their bar, Peter (Michael Shannon), a man who seems even more distant and unsure of himself than the lovely Agnes. Peter takes to her, and she to he, despite not knowing a damn thing about him. He has no home, no car, no nothing. Dude\u2019s not even handsome, like her ex. But there\u2019s something kindly, if off-putting about Peter; he seems to listen, you know, care. Chicks dig it if you fake caring about them, you see. At any rate, Agnes lets him spend the night, chastely on the couch.\nBut it quickly transpires that Peter\u2019s not all there. He\u2019s a former war vet, and he\u2019s a little batty about bugs. Sees them everywhere. Once, in the middle of the night, he insists he\u2019s been bitten by an aphid and tears the bed apart looking for it. When he does find it, though, Agnes can\u2019t see it. No one can see it. You know why? Because it\u2019s not there. That doesn\u2019t stop Peter from bitching about it. The next day, he\u2019s spread flystrips all over the motel room. Oh, and somehow gotten a hold of a microscope, the better to look at slides containing his own blood. You know, normal stuff.\nNow, you or I might think, \u201cHey, Peter\u2019s whacked from being tested with drugs by sinister Army doctors!\u201d and that he clearly needs some freaking medical attention. R.C. points out to Peter that aphids don\u2019t bite, and he in turn accuses her of selling him out to The Man. And of course, at that point, as you might predict, Agnes goes crazy at her friend, screaming at her that she\u2019s trying to take away the only thing Agnes has left in her life, and yadda yadda yadda, and it all ends with a classic line of \u201cGet out of here! And don\u2019t you ever come back!\u201d Knowing that logic has been jettisoned might actually help the viewer here, because plainly a lot of stuff here just isn\u2019t meant to make any sense. It\u2019s a screenwriter\u2019s crutch, really, having a character be so completely off the wall that one can\u2019t relate at all. Peter goes from being simply creepy (and, it should be noted, not someone a fragile, single woman should ever allow into her home) to certifiable in the wink of an eye. Much worse, though, is that Agnes goes from being intelligent and romantic to being\u2026 well, really, really dumb. Suddenly nothing she says contains one iota of smarts. It\u2019s as if Peter\u2019s enormous head (seriously, go look at Michael Shannon) was sucking all the brains out of Agnes. Or she sucked the crazy out of him. Because, come to think of it, she wasn\u2019t loopy until after she slept with him.\nI have to wonder, though, if this movie is supposed to be ironic. Because it\u2019s loaded, absolutely chock full, of seemingly unintentional comedy. Here\u2019s an actual line. Actual line, mind you: \u201cAgnes! Tell me what you don\u2019t know!\u201d I am the dumber for having typed those words. Watching this movie is like being hit repeatedly about the skull with a blunt instrument. It\u2019s badly written - this stuff wouldn\u2019t make sense on paper, why would it make sense in a movie? - terribly acted, and an overall embarrassment. One plus: Judd is naked for quite a bit of time, rare for such a high-caliber actress."}

But we do see a lot of the same basic concepts, like a victim wakes to find himself in some sort of diabolical trap, and he must suffer incredible pain if he wants to live. I have to admit that the devices themselves - and the plots they forward - are pretty ingenious. In one scene, a husband and wife wake to find themselves impaled on a series of sharp sticks. That is, a stick enters the woman's body and exits, and then enters the man's body. The backstory is that she was physically abused by him for many years, and now she literally holds his life in her hands. She can live, but only if she removes the sticks, and by doing so his vital organs are skewered. Awesome stuff.\nBut at its heart, this is a revenge movie. Revenge of Jigsaw for the wrongs he'd suffered. In IV, we find out a heck of a lot more about John's life story, what made him who he is. In fact, we learn he has/had an ex-wife, who makes an extended experience here. Can the ex-wife jokes, you guys out there. She's actually a good guy in this one. I think. It's hard to tell, the plot's so convoluted. You did something wrong to Jigsaw? You die violently. Cut him off at the supermarket? Dinged his car in the parking lot? Littered on his part of the sidewalk? Man, you are so dead.\nMeanwhile, all the cops and agents are trying desperately to find out where the actual Jigsaw headquarters is, because the killings continue - and one of their own is missing. Well, more than one, actually; one's been gone six months. But another just vanished, and for some reason the men in blue think he's the one behind everything. They may have a point, since as they follow his trail the bodies pile up. And, as I said, each victim has been selected for a specific reason. Man, if Jigsaw put as much effort into saving the world as he did in killing people off, we'd be pretty set.\nThis ain't for the squeamish, certainly. First scene is Jigsaw being cut open during an autopsy, and no sight is worse, perhaps, than seeing the skull sawed open, the skin flapped down, the brain removed... Eww. It's a big fat eww, and it's not the only one. If I were you, I wouldn't eat anything sticky or squishy while watching this - parts of it make Hostel seem like Herbie the Love Bug.\nThe biggest caveat is that the plot is a little tough to follow, since your mind is overwhelmed by all the carnage. At one point during the final ten minutes or so, a character appears whom I swear I didn't even recognize, and that's because some of the events of IV run parallel, timewise, to those in III. Saw III was so last year, so I didn't remember the character.\nOverall, though, there is no substantial dropoff in quality from III to IV. Or even, really, from II to IV; the first one still reigns supreme, but that's partly because it was all fresh for us back then, and the others have had to live up to that film's standard. IV manages to hold its own; good thing, too, since it's very likely we'll see a V and a VI."}

Unfortunately, while the motives of the good guy (playes by Christian Bale) are both noble and realistic, some of the actions of the bad guy (Russell Crowe) may leave you scratching your head, and while nebulous intentions can make for wonderful mystery, in the end you're still not sure why Crowe's dastardly Ben Wade has done what he's done, and what it all means.\nDan Evans (Bale) is a dirt-poor farmer who lost a leg in the Civil War. His farm's about to be foreclosed by an unscrupulous land owner who's taken to damming a river and burning down Evans' barn to force him off his own property. So when stagecoach robber Ben Wade (Crowe) is captured and needs to be escorted to the nearby town to get on the titular train, Evans volunteers, both to gain payment to help save his farm and to save face in front of his two kids, one of whom is sick from tuberculosis and one who thinks his old man is a spineless failure. Saddled by debt and ungrateful kids, Evans' decision and motivation is easy to understand.\nAh, but getting the nefarious Wade to Yuma is going to be a complicated trick indeed, because the rest of his gang, led by Charlie Prince (Ben Foster) isn't going to let their fearless leader be trundled off to Yuma to die. Luckily, bounty hunter Byron McElroy (a gritty Peter Fonda) gets the idea of using a decoy stagecoach to lure the varmints off the trail while he and the rest of the posse, including Evans, schlep Wade in the other direction. The gambit works for a while, allowing the good guys to place precious geographical space between them and the bad guys; it also allows the movie to continue unabated. Because, after all, there are more people in Wade's gang then there are trying to bring him to justice - all they'd have to do is find him, shoot the hell out of the place, and grab him.\nAlthough there's plenty of gunplay and death by bullets, this is much more of a psychological drama than anything else. Wade, as played coldly (but not charmlessly) by Crowe, has two goals in mind: gain the mental upper hand on Evans, an untrained rancher, and gain his escape from the clutches of law and order. Meanwhile, although Evans' intentions are less murky, he's not some squinty-eyed sharpshooter whose aim is always true; he's not an iconic hero who you just know is gonna save the day. Bale is terrific; you can really see the anguish he feels as a supposed failure in the eyes of his sons. In the hands of lesser actors, these two complex roles would have seemed less symbiotic and therefore less sincere. For example, apparently Movie Guy Tom Cruise was initially supposed to have Wade's role; if that had come to fruition, we would have been distracted by Movie Star Tom Cruise, and the movie would have suffered terribly as a result.\nBut despite the wonderful performances by Bale and Crowe, the movie's shortcoming is that Ben Wade's intentions seem rather inscrutable. I don't mean that they're simply ambiguous (is he going to flee or help the good guys fight off Navajo Indians?), I mean that they don't make much sense. One minute, Wade is all set to get away from Evans and escape to the safety of his gang, but in the next he's actually fending off his gang as it attacks Evans. There's no explanation given for this change of heart, but the new attitude is gone as quickly as it arrives, leaving the viewer a little puzzled. Sure, some may explain this as \"Wade comes to respect Evans and so doesn't want to see the rancher killed,\" but Wade's actions were much more than that. He wasn't just trying to save Evans, you see, he was actively trying to knock off members of his own gang, and the reason for that escaped me completely.\nStill, 3:10 to Yuma is firmly entertaining, benefiting from two gritty, believable performances by Crowe and Bale, although it's marred by some unexplained actions on the part of its charismatic villain."}

Highlights include Christopher Walken's waaaaay over the top performance as Feng, a mysterious, rich, eccentric ping pong fan; Thomas Lennon as an ubermean German Olympian; the luxuriant Maggie Q as a table tennis champion who dresses in skimpy short-shorts; and comically terrified male sex slaves.\nRandy Daytona (Dan Fogler) was once a promising young ping ponger. Back in 1988, he made the U.S. Olympic team and was all set (at age 12) to win against Lennon's Karl Wolfschtagg when he slipped and fell and couldn't return a serve, thus not only losing his chance at a medal but also sealing his father's fate, as the elder Daytona had bet heavily on the match. Years later, the adult Randy is approached by FBI Agent Rodriguez (George Lopez) to help the government nail the guy who had Randy's pop iced - a mysterious man named Feng, whose face no one's photographed or even seen. The feds know Feng's up to evil plans, but they need Randy to enter a private, super-secret ping pong tournament run by Feng at his undisclosed lair so they can get the goods on him.\nRandy sucks at ping pong now, though, so he must undergo Karate Kid-like training under the wise tutelage of the blind Master Wong (James Hong). To make sure no stereotypes are left alone, Wong also runs a Chinese restaurant. Oh well, at least he doesn't say the whole training bit is an ancient Chinese secret. Anyway, Wong's got a niece, or daughter, I've already forgotten which, who is superdupercrazygood at competitive ping pong. She can even fend off four players while taking orders over the phone at the restaurant, she's that darn good. Of course, it falls to her - that would be Maggie Q playing (get this) a woman named Maggie - to train the living bejeezus out of Randy. It should be pointed out here that while Maggie is sensual, gorgeous, and overall wonderful, Randy is fat, slovenly, a little sarcastic. In other words, it's a typical movie love-match, isn't it? From the moment Maggie puts Randy's arm in a chicken wing, you know they're gonna hook up.\nBut the real fun comes at Feng's tournament. For one thing, Walken's Feng is wearing a different outfit every time you see him, seemingly; he's sort of like Ming the Merciless, only not as bland. Walken vamps like only Walken can vamp, but it's sort of easy to steal a movie from guys like Fogler and Lopez. Even so, it's hard to overstate how much Walken overacts, even for Walken. If you're not a Walken fan, that is to say, you'll find nothing to like about this movie. Sure, some may call it hammy acting, but it's acting... nonetheless... isn't it? Then there's the tourney itself - it's sudden death, you see, and that's meant literally. Lose, and you get a blowdart to the neck, courtesy of Feng's right-hand chica, played by Aisha Tyler. And of course, along the way the underdog Randy must face his old enemy Karl, who so gleefully ended Daytona's amateur - and professional - career nearly twenty years earlier. But Randy's not even sure he wants to stick around, seeing as how everyone's getting killed. He's funny like that.\nBalls of Fury, brought to you by the guys behind Reno 911 and A Night at the Museum, does have its moments of funny, but by and large it suffers from a scattershot script and haphazard directing - it looks almost like it's some film student's final thesis project thingy. It's not quite as good as it should have been, and it's not nearly funny enough to be worth a theater ticket."}

Sounds intriguing, but there's simply not enough substance behind the style (perpetrated by director Joel Schumacher and cinematographer Matthew Libatique) to justify the ominousness. The movie feels like a conspiracy theory spouted off by a aged wino, although Jim Carrey, as the suddenly changed protagonist, is appropriately grim and unhinged throughout.\nCarrey is Walter Sparrow, a pet-control officer (i.e., dog catcher) who begins reading a self-published, self-printed book called \"The Number 23\" by a pseudonymous author, Topsy Kretz, that seems to eerily mirror Walter's own life and that points to 23 as a number steeped in meaning. As Walter reads, he becomes more and more attuned to the number's presence, even creating grand stretches of truth to make it fit (such as sometimes adding the digits of numbers to get 23, and other times adding the combined numbers, anything to reach the goal). In between reading the book - which most of us would probably finish in an evening but that Walter takes many days to complete - Walter has vivid nightmares that end with his killing his wife Agatha (Virginia Madsen).\nThe question isn't really whether Walter's insane, because clearly he's a bit not sane. The question is, as posited by the movie, whether the number 23 has any kind of particular hold over certain people. The movie doesn't address why some people who read the book don't get all bent out of shape over it, or why this particular number is more powerful than any other number. It simply tells us that the number 23 Means Something, and that Something is never a good thing.\nWalter's desperate attempts at retaining his sanity and solving the mystery of the unknown author draw both Agatha and their thirteen-year-old (what, not 23?) son into the situation, which is good, because it gives Carrey something to react to other than mood lighting and creepy basements. Carrey leaves most of the shameless, doofus mugging aside for a more \"serious\" - scare quotes totally necessary - acting here, opting instead for a mostly constant eye-lolling hysteria and paranoia.\nIf the movie had wound up being a stark psychological thriller with no easy ending, it might have been serviceable, but instead it's wrapped up way too neatly for such a plot based in mysticism and conspiracies. At the end, you kind of expect someone to remove a rubber mask and say they would have gotten away with it, if it weren't for that meddling thirteen-year-old kid, his bookstore-owning milf-like mom, and his wacko dad. In short, the ending is trite and utterly predictable, a little too realistic and believable in a movie that could have used a shot of imagination adrenaline."}
< {"rating": "8", "date": "26 August 2007", "title_id": "tt0416449", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "Cry \"Havoc\" and watch this film of war", "content": "Remember those commercials for the US Marines, wherein some ripped young recruit is climbing a mountain, and then he almost falls as he reaches the summit, so he reaches out with a muscular arm and, gritting his teeth and emitting some sort of war cry, he reaches for the mountain and hoists himself up? That's sort of how the entire two hours of 300: men screaming as they stab, fillet, garrote, gut, and impale their enemies on pointy things. It takes two hours because there are so many enemies, and because they're using spears and swords instead of guns.\n300 is loosely based on a real-life event, the 480 BC defense by a small band of Spartan soldiers of their homeland from a marauding Persian army, led by Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). The movie is more directly based on Frank Miller's graphic novel about the battle itself, so some liberties are taken, but more importantly the use of the comic as the basis allows the blood and gore to be shown in an almost-surrealistic format, thus enabling the normal (read: not bloodthirsty) viewer to enjoy the film without feeling guilt at seeing so much mayhem.\nKing Leonidas (Gerard Butler) has a tough decision to make. An emissary from Xerxes meets him and tells him that Sparta must bend its knee to its new ruler. Leonidas will have none of this, and soon the messenger and his companions are thrown down a deep pit. Okay, that was an easy decision. Now Leonidas must decide whether to wait for Xerxes' army or to take the fight to the edge of the sea, meeting the enemy there. The trouble is, Sparta is a society with touches of democracy: in order to go to war, Leonidas must get approval from the Council, which isn't inclined to give it. This does not stop our hero-king.\nThe last time I saw an adaptation of a Frank Miller graphic novel, I was extremely unimpressed - Sin City, I thought, was terrible both technically and creatively. But 300 is different; the blood, which is omnipresent, is stylized, wonderfully imagined, and incredibly detailed, even on a ten-year-old, 27-inch TV set. You can literally see individual drops of blood as they fall from each wound! Some of you are already shaking your heads - \"Um, that's not a good thing, seeing that!\" - but you're wrong! Or, you're not wrong, just not the intended audience for 300. The movie, particularly the battle scenes, can be best compared to the fight scene in Kill Bill Vol. 1 in which Uma Thurman takes on the Crazy 88. In that scene, Thurman's Beatrice slices and dices through minions after minions, lopping off limbs with aplomb; it's much the same here in 300, and in each scene the violence is raised (or lowered) to an appropriate cartoonish level.\nButler gives a truly commanding performance - perhaps on par with Russell Crowe's turn as Maximus in Gladiator or Mel Gibson's in Braveheart, a true, fearless leader who is well prepared to die to save his country and his land. Leonidas is terrifyingly strong and courageous, an imposing figure even in the eyes of Xerxes, who fancies himself a king-god (at the time, the Persian army was the largest in the world). Leonidas must inspire his countrymen not only to fight for their families and homes but also to follow him to their certain deaths. I mean, come on - 300 soldiers against tens of thousands? It's not an obvious victory. Butler is truly up to the test as the tenacious warrior king, a man who would rather die than be subjugated - a fact that eludes Xerxes until the battles are nearly over.\nOn one level, too, this is a chick flick. I mean, every male actor is bare chested, and he's totally cut. (The actors had to work out using some pretty intense, tortuous methods to get those six-pack abs.) So if you're of the female persuasion and like well-built men, this is a movie for you. Sure, they stab each other a lot, so that might put you off, but look! Half-naked men! You gotta love that, right? And for the men, there's sweet, sweet death of numerous characters, some named, mostly not. In fact, according to IMDb, 585 deaths occur in the movie! Sweet indeed.\nWhile Leonidas and his 300 battle to the death, a battle of words takes place back at home. Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) tries valiantly to persuade the Council to send the full Spartan army - Leonidas wasn't permitted to take them, obviously, since the Council hadn't granted permission for war - to help back up their king. To do this, she must work her way around the conniving Theron (Dominic West, who looks a lot like Harry Hamlin and acts like Han Solo gone way bad). And that's fun and all, and Headey is wonderful - and gorgeous and wise - but thankfully these scenes are short and small in number. The battle scenes are the real draw! HA-OH! Although the violence may turn some people off, those who like that sort of thing will be enthralled at its exquisite detail and poetic beauty. Butler is so superb, you want to leap into your TV and follow him to the ends of the Earth."}

If you can stomach the 186 instances of the f-word - and I'm sure most of you can - you'll never stop laughing. It's hysterical. I'm not going to put it on the level of classics such as Airplane! or Young Frankenstein, but coming from a thirtysomething who's not the intended audience, it's badass in its funniosity. It's a movie in which high school seniors talk like high school seniors and act like high school seniors, not a movie like Porky's, in which guys with receding hairlines pretended they hadn't yet grown pubic hair.\nFirst things first - I'm changing my name to McLovin, because it's THAT hardcore. When chicks hear my name, they may give me an askance look, but they're really thinking, \"Hm, that is so hawt.\" I know this because Fogel (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) wound up scoring, sort of, on the basis of his new name. That's right, pushed-up glasses, dorky haircut, stammering, it all means diddly if you have one and only one name. Why else did Madonna get so much action back in the day? Or Jackee'? Or Cher. Or Fabio. Yes, I'll be the thirtysomething, Dilbert-like Fabio. Chicks dig that.\nFantasy aside, here's the basic plot. Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) are longtime buds who are nearing the end of their high school existence. They expected to go to college together as well, but it turned out that Evan was hella smarter than Seth, so although the former got into Dartmouth, the latter could do no better than a state college. Moreover, it's the standard end-of-school party time! Seth wants desperately to hook up with Jules, who's hosting the party. To get into her good graces, he tells her that he and Evan will supply the shindig with booze. (Everyone's underage, in case that wasn't clear.) Meanwhile, Evan has the hots for Becca, whom he respects - Evan's one of those quiet, sensitive types, always tripping over himself not to be impolite while being awkward. The boys now have a quest - use Fogel's newfound fake ID - he's suddenly a 25-year-old Hawaiian named McLovin! - to buy a metric crapload of liquor for the party.\nAs with Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, everything goes wrong. Fogel's separated from Evan and Seth when the liquor store is robbed, and the other two wind up at a soir\u00e9e where, among other things, Seth winds up with a nasty liquid on his pants. Plus there are two ribald, hell-raising cops who smoke, drink, shoot their guns in the air - on duty. Aw, yeah. \"Can I shoot one?\" asks Fogel. \"I don't know,\" replies Officer Michaels, \"can you?\" On one level, this is pure raunch, with sex and cursing (and even some mild drug use). Lots of sex references that might squick you out if you're of a certain age and can't handle teens even thinking about fornication. (You probably haven't read this far, then, bailing when the \"f-word\" term was used earlier.) But even so, the profanity seems somehow natural, almost organic - this is how kids talk. Not all, surely, but some portion. It's not as if they're all being presented as child prodigies who harbor mean streaks, they're merely acting as typical teens might.\nOn another level, though, there is deep meaning in the relationship between Evan and Seth, two friends who have grown to be completely dependent on each other over the years, so much so that they're in denial about their future - Evan will be rooming with Fogel at Dartmouth, a fact he's kept from Seth. Seth is arrogant, loud, obnoxious, and not particularly bright or gallant, and Evan is his polar opposite in nearly everything. Neither one exudes machismo or toughness, although Seth puts up a good front. Their sweet, platonic relationship comes off as sincere to its very core. This is not a cheap dichotomy thrown together for laughs; you get the feeling Seth and Evan really care for each other and that each feels he'd be hopelessly lost without the other. It's a bittersweet feeling.\nBut that's all below the surface. Revel instead on the entertaining performances by the bombastic Hill and the reserved Cera - these guys act as if they've known each other all their lives, the chemistry's so good. Also no slouch is the inimitable Mintz-Plasse, who's a bit like DJ Qualls' character in Road Trip: geeky and yet appealing as all get out."}

And the toughest true-crime thriller to make is probably one in which the culprit, in real life, was never caught. Then what do you do, hotshot? What do you do? If you're director David Fincher, you focus the plot not on the killings or on the resolution of the case but rather on the massive manhunt and intrepid detective work turned in by Inspectors David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) as well as the unofficial sleuthing by newspapermen Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal). Thus humanizing the forces attempting to bring the Zodiac to justice, Fincher is able to not only tell the tale straightforwardly but also scare the bejezus out of his audience, as is his wont. By identifying with the four leads, the audience has no choice but to hope against hope - knowing what it knows of the real story - that somehow good will persevere.\nOf the four leads, the weak spot might be assumed to be the callow Gyllenhaal, but as it turns out he's easily the strongest link in a tough chain of thespians. Graysmith, on whose book the movie is based, doggedly pursued the case as the paper's cartoonist, much to the chagrin of those around him - his employers, his colleagues, and his wife (Chloe Sevigny) and kids. Graysmith MUST KNOW what happened. He wants to look Zodiac in the eye and somehow determine his culpability. Gyllenhaal - who should change his name to an easier to spell surname - is absolutely aces, which is a phrase I never thought I'd type regarding Jake Gyllenhaal. He's never impressed me, looking to have exactly one emotion - moroseness - and I've always thought he was far too highly rated, But here, young Jake has won me over, just as Josh Hartnett did with Lucky Number Slevin and Kate Winslet did with any number of films after the awful Titanic. Gyllenhaal is superb, believable, and sincere in a commanding performance.\nThe others aren't slouches, of course. Downey, Jr., aping Al Pacino from Serpico - except not playing a burned-out cop, just a burned-out reporter - is appreciatively scuzzy as Avery, a man never too far from a dangling cigarette or a murky drop of alcohol. Ruffalo and Edwards (where's he been?) are a perfect match as two cops as desperate as Graysmith to find out the killer's identity, all the while trying to coordinate with other jurisdictions, the press, and the public. Ruffalo in particular is a treat to watch, and I'm not going on a limb when I say that someday that young man will have an Oscar nom to his credit.\nFincher creates a edgy atmosphere throughout - you honestly believe Zodiac will leap out from any corner's shadows to knife or gun you down. He also achieves the tough task of showing the passage of time efficiently - by showing the construction of a San Francisco skyscraper in stop-motion. Nice touches like that can make a film. And of course, Fincher is no stranger to descending to the depths of ourselves, what with movies like Seven, Panic Room, and Fight Club to his credit. With Zodiac, he's managed to take a riveting story and make it even more compelling - even without a compelling ending in real life."}

Nicole Kidman gives a pitch-perfect performance as a mother who must stay away for the sake of her uniquely immune child, added a jolt of adrenalin to an already frantic, uncomposed, and passionate treatise on how people react when things go wrong.\nIt all starts with the US Space Shuttle exploding over the country during its return trip, scattering debris in a wide swatch from Dallas to Washington about 200 miles wide. People are warned not to touch the wreckage pieces, but do they listen? Not only don't they listen, but some of the stuff turns up on eBay - the second time this year the online auction service plays a role in a motion picture. But it seems that the debris isn't entirely benign, anymore, as it the astronauts had unwittingly been carrying an alien parasite on the outside of their craft.\nSoon, those who have touched the debris are contaminated. But they're not killed, no, they're merely turned into shells of themselves, sort of how a viewer feels after watching too much Fox News. (Hey, I kid because I love freedom fries.) I mean, everyone who's infected is at the same level of emotion, which is to say, none at all; no one even raises an eyebrow. Meanwhile, the grand ol' guvmint decides to get ahead of the curve by inoculating the bejeezus out of everyone - for free! Awfully nice of then, really, although perhaps the fact that they had all that serum should have been a warning sign of sorts.\nCarol Bennell (Kidman) is a trained psychologist who has a darling little son on whom she dotes; the father (Jeremy Northam) left them years ago but has suddenly shown up to reenter the boy's life. Coincidentally, he's also the head of the CDC, which is at the epicenter of this flu pandemic (I wanted so bad to say \"epicenter of epidemic\" there), so naturally he's got some of the bad alien crap on him - handed to him, somewhat ham-handedly, by someone who found it at a crash site. Soon there's a race against, well, not time, but something, as dear ol' dad and his zombie-like cohorts try their damndest to get to carol and Oliver.\nJoining the intrepid shrink is her best bud/wannabe lover Ben (Daniel Craig), who's a doctor or something and who has a serious case of the yabba-yabba-do-mes for Carol, but the feeling's not entirely reciprocated, on account of Carol doesn't want to lose the wonderful friendship they've built up (they live next door to each other, the carpool). Groan. Points for plausibility, but negative points for obviousness and needlessness. On top of that, there's an issue with the romantic chemistry between the slight Brit and the willowy Aussie; they actually SEEM more like they should be best buds and nothing more. When the kiss, the Earth doesn't tremble, it yawns and asks for another beer.\nBut forget the romantic angle, and let's focus on the escaping-from-bad-people-who-look-like-our-friends angle. As with the first two filmings of the Jack Finney novel, people fall victim to the virus when they fall into sleep, as their cells are attacked during the body's REM cycle. So now you know the plan: Stay Awake. The very first scene in the movie slams this point home, as a raccoon-eyed Kidman scurries around a devastated drugstore, looking to score uppers and caffeine, anything to keep Morpheus or the Sandman from getting her. And she's damn convincing at it, too, which says a lot about Kidman's abilities; she's a tremendous actress who can play a variety of roles, which is in itself tough to believe of someone who's so elegant and luxuriant in appearance. Kidman's so good that her acting - I know, go figure - completely distracts you from the fact that she's gorgeous. Even when she's dressing down, or when she looks like a crack whore desperate for another fix - she radiates sincerity.\nHere's a question - how come, when people are infected by this alien virus, they gain the speed of, well, zombies? Shouldn't they be as fast as they were in the Before Time? The people here are one step away from full-on shambling, which makes you think it'd be fairly easy to get away from them - except that there are a LOT of them. In one scene, a good thirty of the mindless bastards jump on Carol's car to prevent her escape, and off she barely drives, losing more as she veers. Brought to mind the whole clowns-in-a-Volkswagen trick.\nThe Invasion is spectacular, a realistic-seeming, fervent example of what might happen were the Earth to suffer a colossal pandemic. Remember, they've been talking about a flu pandemic for many years! Nicole Kidman is, as usual, awesome; you're as scared for her and her progeny as Carol is."}

But while Shaun was a more-or-less tongue-in-cheeky-cheek look at zombie movies, Fuzz is a little more straightforward, going for an action-comedy vibe rather than a horror-comedy vibe. This isn't to say Hot Fuzz fails to meet expectations, it's just that you sort of have to make sure your expectations are calibrated efficiently.\nNicholas Angel (Pegg) is a straight-arrow London bobby who is extremely good at his job. Crime declines considerably when he's on the beat, much to the dismay of his superiors, who feel he's making the rest of them look bad. As a punishment for his good deeds, Angel is transferred to the hinterlands of England, specifically a small village called Sandford, where he proceeds to lock up half the town in his first night on such reckless crimes as underage drinking and urinating in public. Oops, turns out the criminal of the second crime is his new partner - cue wacky soundtrack - who's also the son (Frost) of the police chief (Jim Broadbent). Off to a bad start already, Angel is chagrined to learn that the police force in the sleepy town doesn't really care a lot about crimestopping, instead electing to eat, drink, loaf, that sort of thing. Then people start to die in mysterious and gruesome ways, and only Angel believes they're all connected. The deaths, not the people themselves, although that's also possible. He smells a conspiracy, is what I'm trying to say here. But no one believes him - cue wacky soundtrack again.\nNow, this might have come off as a one-note, dumb action movie if it weren't for the grim determination of Pegg to essay a character of some depth. He's not simply a righteous cop out to save the world, he's a nice guy who has ultimate respect for the law and is devastated when others don't. Pegg's performance is perfectly sincere, and although he seems unassuming and even vague - witness his Shaun of the Dead - he is commanding, taciturn, and an utter delight as the seemingly humorless, single-minded cop. He's fantastic, and because his character is so emotionless, the other actors by contrast seem even funnier, particularly Frost as a doofus who'd love to be more than what he is, if only there weren't so much work involved. Broadbent, Stuart Wilson, Paddy Considine, and a wolfish Timothy Dalton round out a pitch-perfect cast.\nHot Fuzz is splendid, a genial change from Shaun of the Dead, as it maintains all the soul and equilibrium of that minor classic without feeling stodgy, stilted, or dull. Pegg in particular - good thing, since he's the lead - manages to elevate the proceedings magnificently. Oh, and watch for Peter Jackson and Cate Blanchett in cameos (hint: it'll be tough to spot Blanchett)."}

He's scared, he's frustrated, and he's in mourning, since losing his beloved Marie (whom he met in the first Bourne movie and who died in the second). Bourne's put together a little bit of his past, after killing scores of people with skills he didn't know he had, but now a British reporter has published a series of articles about Bourne - and they seem to contain a lot more detail than an outsider would have. This sets the plot in motion, as Bourne's flushed out into the open in London, and the CIA battles with itself to either bring him in or shoot him dead like a dog.\nYou can see the frustration build on Damon's increasingly creased face; he's looking older, weathered, beaten down - although Bourne can still disarm two strong bastards quick like a bunny rabbit. Jason Bourne doesn't have much to go on regarding his former life, but he's able to grasp at a couple of loose threads and weave a comfy blanket out of them. That sort of sums up this movie, really - it's a comfy blanket that doesn't go overboard in trying to wow the viewer while avoiding the appearance of stagnation. Damon has grown rather well into the lead - ironically, he looks a hell of a lot more believable here than he did as Edward Wilson in the recent The Good Shepherd. Damon's grim and determined but not robotic; he appears to be a couple of steps ahead of the audience, anyway, and that's what's important.\nHelping Damon out is an excellent supporting cast. Joan Allen is back as CIA operative Pamela Landy and manages to look tough while not looking bitchy. Great job, Joan! David Strathairn joins the cast as CIA Deputy Director Noah Vosen, with an aging Scott Glenn as the agency's director. Turns out Strathairn (who's also a fantastic actor - see him in Good Night, and Good Luck, for example) and Allen have tremendous chemistry together; their in-office battles could have come off as just histrionics, but both actors use steely glares in lieu of angsty shouting. When these two were on screen, the tension was palpably thick, and you were always wondering if the characters had ulterior motives in how they want to deal with Bourne.\nAlso back is Julia Stiles as Nicky Parsons; her scenes with Damon far supersede those he had with Franka Potente in the first two Bourne films. So much is said with a flit of the eyes, with a curl of a lip. We aren't beat over the head with Nicky's motivations - in fact, they're left rather vague, which is good - and neither she nor Bourne behaves quite as predicted when they're interacting.\nI wasn't a huge fan of the first in the series (The Bourne Identity), and I felt that the second (The Bourne Supremacy) was a little bit better. This one, purportedly the last of them, is the best of the lot, although that's perhaps damning with faint praise. One trouble is that there are plot holes that you can drive a car through. Another is that when director Paul Greengrass wants to film an action scene, he makes sure no cut lasts more than a half-second, else your brain would be able to follow what's going on. It's extremely chaotic, intended to convey the sense of how a real fistfight or car crash would appear, but still - I don't need the scenes to be so realistic that I get a headache from watching them. This is supposed to be fun for me! A favorite dumb moment - Bourne's involved in a high-speed chase that culminates with his car hitting a parked car and then getting slammed by the chasing car, from behind. Bourne, of course, exits his car with a few scratches, although the guy who slammed INTO him dies while slumped over his car. Makes little sense. Sure, we need to see violent crashes - it's the American way! - but c'mon. No injuries? Heck, at least Bruce Willis limped a bit in the new Die Hard movie.\nAnd finally, although this is alleged to be the last of the Bournes, it's all left rather open ended. Which is a shame, really; at the end, you'll notice there's a great chance to finish the series definitively without making it seem too pat. And the filmmakers passed this up, presumably to ensure they could have another shot at making millions more dollars."}

Because I heart Ben Stiller!\" or \"This is going to be the suckiest bunch of suck that ever was, because Ben Stiller's in it.\" Ben's sort of a polarizing comedy figure in movies these days; people are either enthralled by his mugging and one-note performances, or they're not. Ordinarily, I fall among the latter group: The guy just kind of skeeves me out a little. I don't think he's funny. His deadpan deliveries do nothing for me. They do nothing! And yet in Night at the Museum, Stiller's inabilities don't matter a whit. How could they, when the main focus is on the CGI special effects and supporting performances? See, it actually helps here that Stiller's so annoying and dull, because for the most part all he has to do is react to the mayhem around him. He doesn't have to have a take-charge personality, really.\nStiller is Larry, a sad-sack, sometimes-employee jack-of-no-trades who reluctantly accepts a job as the night watchman at the Museum of Natural History in New York. The departing guards, led by Cecil (Dick van Dyke), tell Larry to read the instruction manual, and as it turns out that's good advice, as the museum's exhibits - animals, historical figures, what have you - all come to life after dark. Some, like Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams) roam the museum freely, while others, like the miniatures from the Old West and Roman Empire displays, are stuck in their glass (plastic?) enclosures. Oh, and the giant T-Rex skeleton comes to life, too, but it's really just a big ol' puppy dog, yes it is, so that's not too dangerous, either. No, the real problem is that if any of these denizens gets out of the museum, he or she turns to dust. Dust, I say! That could get messy.\nPlus, Larry's dealing with home issues, as his son Nick (Jake Cherry) thinks his dad's a big stinkin' loser who can't do anything right, which isn't much different than how most people think of Ben Stiller, anyway; Nick's drifting away from Larry, psychologically, and toward his stepdad, who seems more solid and stable. Meanwhile, Larry's trying to meet cute with the museum's tour guide, Rebecca (Carla Gugino), because it's illegal in forty states to have a comedy without a love interest of some kind, and the monkeys don't count.\nAnyway, despite the Stiller casting, which often seemed like a bad decision, the movie's pretty damn funny. And it oughta be, since it was written by two of the guys behind Reno 911! - Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon. Plus, it has noted funny people like Williams (who's very good, actually reining in his zaniness just enough; he manages to lend gravitas to the role) and Owen Wilson (who steals every scene, chews it up, and vomits funny) who allow Stiller to just sit there and, to quote Wilson's Jedadiah, take it like a man. Well, comically speaking. Serving as the comic foil to Wilson (who plays a miniature Old West cowboy who's a little sensitive about his height) is Steve Coogan, who plays Roman emperor Octavius. Yes, history be damned, the cowboys and the gladiators are constantly waging war against each other.\nThe movie is that it never really takes itself too seriously - i.e., you never have Great Important Issues that Larry must face, alone, in order to Save the Day. The only thing that's grand and sweeping about this movie is the awesome special effects, which are whimsical and fun without being intrusive.\nAdding to the fun are the three actors playing the retiring/fired, aged museum guards - some nobodies called Dick van Dyke, Mickey Rooney, and Bill Cobbs. These guys don't look like they've lost a step with their comic timing, and how great is it to see Rooney piping up every few minutes with a snarly catchphrase-worthy line like \"Listen up, lunchbox!\" These guys more than make up for the sad-sack Stiller. Which leads me to the one real debit of the movie - there are a few too many times in which Stiller's Larry must Take Charge, and as an actor he just doesn't convey that sort of attitude well. He's a good supporting actor, but I think someone with a little more panache - but still with a light comic touch - would have been a much better fit."}

A veritable sea of emotions, from love, despair, neglect, and hate churns below their pristine, everything-in-its-place veneers.\nThe placidity of this particular neighborhood is jolted by two things: the arrival of a sex offender (Jackie Earle Haley) and the emergence of a relationship between married-but-not-to-each-other Sarah and Brad; both events, directly and obliquely, are remarked upon by the nattering nabobs of middle-class conservatism in the town, particularly the rather particular hausfraus and soccer moms.\nSarah Pierce (Winslet) is a distant mother and wife; when she and her daughter Lucy visit the neighborhood playground, she sits away from the other mothers. As an indirect result, Lucy doesn't play with the other boys and girls on the see-saws or merry-go-round - she just plays quietly. Meanwhile, as the empty-headed women babble to each other (but not Sarah), a newcomer enters their midst - a stay-at-home father, Brad, whom they mockingly call (behind his back, of course) \"The Prom King.\" Sarah's marriage seems empty and devoid of purpose. Brad, for his part, is married to a breadwinner - his wife Karen (Jennifer Connelly) is a documentary filmmaker who's completely absorbed with her work. Like Sarah, Brad is a little emotionally distant from his wife and their son, Aaron, so it's no wonder he and Sarah become constant companions throughout the long, hot suburban summer, spending their days either at the park or at the public pool.\nThe other main story thread involves the community's reaction to the presence of Ronnie McGorvey, convicted as a sex offender for flashing a young boy. Soon, there are fliers on telephone poles, and an angry outrage group is formed, led by ex-policeman Larry (Noah Emmerich), who seems to be more upset with Ronnie's existence than anyone else in the town.\nAt its core, the movie is about repression and \"settling\" - staying with someone just because they provide you comfort but no love is no reason at all, the film explains. Committing adultery just might be an okay act, even with children involved, as long as it means a better life for the principals. Brad and Sarah transform from nodding acquaintances to good friends who take care of their kids together (Aaron and Lucy even grow to become friends, although up to that point they'd both been loners.) When the opportunity arises for them to become more, though, they take it - an act that's not easy to conceal from the prying eyes of the neighbors, let alone their respective spouses and certainly not their children. How long, if at all, can they possibly hope to maintain the charade that they're just friends? Perhaps the thought that their own, current marriages are charades in their own right gives Sarah and Brad reason to believe they can perpetuate the sham against their spouses.\nMeanwhile, Ronnie attempt to cope with living as a sex offender. He lives with his doting mom, who believes there is good in everyone; she realizes that what Ronnie did was wrong, but that it was an accident, and she tries in vain to protect him from the rest of the community, which is by and large out to lynch him. But the brilliant caveat here is that Ronnie is by no means a victim - not only did he do what he was accused of (although he shows remorse and a lot of self-hate), but he shows that he's capable of more of the same.\nIn fact, that's the genius of Todd Field's film - not only are people flawed, but they're believably flawed. In Little Children, people make decisions for selfish reasons, and there's no wondrous epiphany that somehow saves the soul and good standing of the poor decision maker - people live with what they've done, or they don't make the decision in the first place.\nWinslet and Haley were nominated for their work here; the first-ever nomination for Haley, who was probably best known as Kelly Leak in the Bad News Bears films. He's eerie and creepy and utterly human as Ronnie McGorvey. You never really feel sympathy for the deviant, but you might feel a twinge of unease. For Winslet, this was the fifth nomination for the beauteous Briton, and it's astounding that she hasn't yet won. Then again, she's only 31 years old! Little Children is a stark, seamless, unsettling story that grabs a hold of your psyche and twists it almost to the breaking point, relying on strong performances by Winslet, Haley, Wilson, and Emmerich as well as a tortuous plot that provides quite a jaded look at the tranquility of suburban life."}

They're not succeeding on the local talent-show circuit, so they hook up with the famed James \"Thunder\" Early (Murphy) to perform as his backup singers, which doesn't sit too well with Effie. They're coached along by Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx), who attempts to mold them into crossover artists, leaving the placid world of the R&B charts behind for the bigger fame and fortune of the nationwide pop charts.\nNaturally, as some stars rise, others must fall. Early's great, and wildly charismatic, but he's not always what Curtis wants in a star who can appeal to a wide audience. Sowing the seeds of his own destruction, Jimmy falls prey to the usual pitfalls of stardom - money, drugs, and the knowledge that he's no longer the man of the moment. Meanwhile, the Dreamettes are persevering, first as his backup trio and then on their own, conquering what was somewhat deprecatingly called the chitlin circuit. Curtis has grander plans, though; he wants his charges to eventually play Miami, a place far away from Detroit, a place where, as Curtis tells Jimmy, they won't even let black people wait on tables. (Remember, this is in the early sixties.) The movie is based on a Broadway musical, so the songs and choreography - all wonderful - are derived directly from the stage presentation; this may seem a little strange, because given the setting (Motown in the sixties), it seems like there should be bona fide R&B hits coming at you, although admittedly a lot of the songs do sound similar to chart-toppers from that time. In fact, the fashion styles and the songs remind you very strongly of some (figurative) heavyweights in the field at that time: Aretha Franklin and Diana Ross. (It's been said that the Dreamgirls were supposed to be The Supremes, but the movie was merely inspired by the real-life Supremes, which explains why there aren't more real-life names bandied about in the movie; it's not biographical story.) There's no question that Hudson, in her first role, and Murphy, the longtime comedy-film veteran, truly sparkle in their roles and were each deservedly nominated for Academy Awards (Hudson won; Murphy lost to Alan Arkin). As for Hudson - she can SING. I mean, she belts out the tunes with a fantastic mixture of passion, guts, and anger, as best befitting her largely (no pun intended) unhappy character, Effie. And when you watch Murphy, you completely forget he once recorded a song called \"(My Girl Wants to) Party All the Time,\" and the singer he most reminds you of is James Brown. He's spectacular.\nNot so spectacular was Foxx as Curtis Taylor; he was far too low key and, well, morose. He's somewhat believable in turning from a naif in the music world to a cutthroat businessman, but he lacks the screen presence - the panache - to really pull it off. Denzel Washington was reportedly offered the role but declined on the grounds that he can't sing - although I'm sure dubbing wouldn't have made a huge difference.\nStill, it's not much to carp about. The songs are perfect, and the final number is a huge showstopper that'll leave you clapping for more."}

Obviously, stuff you can't get past the censors on television; jokes that are even more adult in nature, drug use, nudity, even some profanity - as long as the basic characterizations and tone of your program aren't mucked with. Right? I mean, what's the point, otherwise? And that's exactly what the cleverly titled The Simpsons Movie manages to do, shoehorning pithy comments and witty repartee into a relatively brief (87 minutes) cinematic explosion, a supernova of one of comedy's brightest stars.\nNow, often full-length feature versions of a TV show will simply be a long episode, or a couple of episodes strung together semicohesively. And semicoherently. But Matt Groening and James L. Brooks takes a plausible-for-the-Simpsons storyline and ratchets up... well, everything. There's more visual and verbal humor, more characters (though not new ones, really), more exciting locales - not just Springfield - and tons of in-jokes, most of which the intended audience is going to fawn over like Bambi's momma. (Speaking of which, there's an amusing scene in which Adorable Woodland Creatures help get Homer and Marge ready for their coital bed.) The basic plot line is that after a lot of nagging by one Lisa Simpson, the horribly polluted Lake Springfield - where people dump crap, dead bodies, and toxic waste - has finally been cleaned up. Mayor Quimby is especially proud of their new deterrent system to prevent people from dumping - it's a wall. But wouldn't you know it, it's only so idiotproof, and Homer winds up throwing an entire silo of pig poop (don't ask) into the lake, immediately killing it and causing some mutant creatures to develop. The EPA, noting this, decides that the entire area must be sealed off, so they put a huge glass dome around Springfield. No one can get in, and most importantly no one - especially toxic waste - can get out. No wonder that in short time the rest of the Springfield citizenry rise up and form an angry mob out to get the Simpsons.\nAs I said, there's nudity - but, sadly, it's not anyone you'd want to see naked. No, not even Patty or Selma. And, believe it or not, there's death! Of course, it's not like any of the Simpsons themselves die, or even a secondary character. But hey, there are literally scores of characters in the Simpsons universe, so it's okay if one of them bites it, right? And double hey, it's not as if the movie is part of any grand continuity - if someone gets hurt in the movie, I'm betting they'll be peachy keen next time you see them in the TV show.\nTo be sure, even though there's some envelope pushing and such, the characters remain who they are - Homer is a complete screwup who somehow manages to both destroy and save everyone at least once; Bart is a selfish brat who picks on his sister and is susceptible to dares; Lisa is a dreamy brain who pines for a new boy; and Marge is the proverbial glue that usually holds them somewhat together.\nThe movie's not very long, which might be its only real debit. It's wildly amusing, and the movie makes the best use out of its short running time, being chock full o' jokes and references that only Comic Book Guys in their mom's basement will get. Thankfully, there are very few celebrity voices - one Name does the voice of the chief bad guy, with the EPA, and another plays himself. (I'm not even including the brief appearance by Green Day, though.) I like that - it'd be too easy for the Bigwigs to shovel in celebrity after celebrity, as has happened in many a Simpsons episode over the years.\nOur favorite yellow family survives its first foray onto the silver screen - the movie is so well done, it feels like an episode from the middle years of the series without seeming like a simple extension of the show. It's hysterical, appropriately raunchy, and just absurd enough to be the ne plus ultra of animated movies. Well, at least those that are animated in a traditional (i.e., not wholly computerized) style. So pass the donuts and gulp down your Duff brew!"}

But it's also very well imagined, and what director David Yates did choose to show on the screen was more than sufficient to tell the story of Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts.\nAt the end of the fourth movie, Harry emerged from the Triwizard tournament with news that Voldemort had returned, and that Cedric Diggory had been killed by him moments earlier. Of course, this news was met with quite a bit of skepticism by the rest of the magic world, most prominently the Ministry of Magic and the Daily Prophet, the two places to which ordinary wizards look for solid, substantiated information. Even some at Hogwarts are dubious about Harry's claims, although not the school's headmaster, Albus Dumbledore.\nBecause the Minister of Magic believes Dumbledore is out for his job and because he's jealous of the relationship the great wizard has with Harry, Hogwarts soon is beleaguered by a brand-new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dolores Umbridge, whose lesson plan seems to be to prevent students from learning how to defend themselves against the Dark Arts, an act of repression that stirs Harry to begin to teach his fellow students on his own, away from the watchful eye of Umbridge, whose unctuous demeanor and oleaginous personality get her appointed as Grand Inquisitor of Hogwarts, allowing her to enact decrees of such oppressive, hate-filled magnitude that the students are more determined than ever to fight back.\nMeanwhile, poor Harry is having terrible visions and nightmares, as he shares some sort of psychic connection with the Dark Lord. Seems Voldemort desires something, something tangible in the Ministry of Magic - but what? Harry's burning forehead scar tells him little, but what visions he does get aren't merely prophetic - they're of things happening right at that moment.\nThe denouement comes with a terrible, terrifying battle royale at the Ministry itself. Sadly, one of the Good Guys doesn't survive.\nI enjoyed a lot of things about this fifth movie: the performances of newcomers Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood), Imelda Staunton (Umbridge), Helena Bonham Carter (a delightfully unhinged Bellatrix Lestrange) as well as the veterans of the series - Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Ralph Fiennes, Julie Walters, David Thewlis, Gary Oldman, and Michael Gambon; the jaw-dropping special effects, especially those of the ghostly thestrals, which only Luna and Harry can see, among their friends; and the wonderful Room of Requirement and Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place (Sirius' parents' home).\nQuite a bit of the book's plot is missing from the movie, of course, including all of the Quidditch scenes and the many scenes in which the students practice for and take their O.W.L. exams; there's also an important sequence in which Harry, Ron, and Hermione visit St. Mungo's to see Mr. Weasley and see Neville visiting his comatose mother and father - up until that point, only Harry knew about the Longbottoms' fate.\nAbout an hour after watching this movie in the theater (a week after it was released), I read the seventh and final book in the Harry Potter series, making this a true Harry Potter weekend. Really, I'm about Pottered out entirely right now. Reading the book and then writing this review means I may have forgotten a few things from the movie that I wanted to mention; did I hear about such and such via the seventh book or via the fifth movie? Hmm.\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is about what it should be - it's compelling, wildly entertaining, and it keeps in the spirit of the books, if not the preceding movies; the tone continues to darken as we rocket to the the finale of Harry's life at Hogwarts and as the bonds of friendship and loyalty tighten around our collective inquisitive minds."}

In other words, not a particularly fun time to be a Ugandan, or to visit Uganda.\nIn the Last King of Scotland, Amin is played by Forest Whitaker, who turns in an Oscar-winning performance as the unhinged leader; it is a singularly magnificent exhibition, a prime example of an actor simply disappearing into a role. Gone is the goofy persona from Good Morning, Vietnam, or the morose hit-man from Diary of a Hit-man; Whitaker is finally at center stage. And where you might expect some actors to ham things up a bit, playing a larger-than-life character, Whitaker comes across as honest and eminently believable. His Amin believes in Uganda, wants to see it prosper, but he's drawn by the centralized power and damaged by bouts of insecurity and self-doubt.\nThe story is told through the eyes of Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy), a young Scotsman who arrived at Uganda hoping to make a difference in the health of Ugandans but who wound up as the personal physician - and a bit more - of the country's unstable president. Garrigan's wide eyed, but not so wide eyed that he can't pause to bed seemingly every woman he lays eyes on. I guess it's the rowdy Scot in him, or something. Anyway, he goes from being a simple country doctor (and making eyes at his colleague's wife) to the presidential palace, where he naturally beds one of Amin's many wives. Nothing good can come of that.\nWhitaker's superb, of course, but McAvoy seemed a little more transparent as the dictator's right-hand man, his number-one closest adviser. McAvoy's Garrigan seemed to wilt in the presence of Amin, which makes sense until you realize part of the characterization is that Garrigan stands up to Amin; that's why the latter respects the former. Even the way Garrigan and Amin meet seems wrong. There's an accident, and the president needs some mending (sprained hand); meanwhile, a cow that had been hit by a car is braying in pain. No one is doing anything about it, so Garrigan grabs Amin's gun - with all his soldiers around him, mind you - and shoots the cow several times. Problem solved. Only we'd seen no evidence that Garrigan could handle a gun or that he was comfortable around them, and we saw virtually nothing after that that would imply he was the strong, heroic type. And, really, grabbing the new president's gun in full view of his heavily armed soldiers? Doesn't make much sense. Later on, toward the end of the movie, Garrigan makes two ridiculously stupid decisions, too, putting the whole notion of his intelligence to the lie.\nThe biggest problem, though, is that nearly all of Garrigan's problems can be traced to one source - his penis. Yeah, I said it. If he'd kept the thing in his pants, he wouldn't have been in ANY trouble with Amin and would have found it a bit easier to eventually leave the country and return to Scotland.\nBut the bottom line is that this is Whitaker's movie, despite the perspective, and he's so perfect that it's easy to forgive McAvoy's lightweight performance and the plot oddities. The Last King of Scotland is a cut above most historical movies, because even knowing the ending won't spoil the fun. It's also exquisitely photographed (in Uganda itself), and it's riddled with electric scenes."}

Any documentary or encyclopedia entry on the decade will note that its final years were \"turbulent\" or \"chaotic\" and that there was this grand coming together of various revolutions - cultural, political, sexual. Things Happened in the late 1960s. Change was Effected. Gone was the bland, colorless 1950s lifestyles that Ma and Pa Kettle loved, the workaday, nothing-changes lives, a time when you could expect things to go as they always had. But once all of these changes began to occur and people from different walks of life found they had things in common with strange, exotic people, the result was a hodge podge of everything that made America unique in the world. With such a potpourri of dizzying issues, any movie about the period is sure to fall short.\nThis is not the case with Emilio Estevez's brilliant Bobby. Bobby follows the lives of 22 disparate people during the weekend of June 5, 1968, at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles - the time and place of Robert F. Kennedy's assassination shortly after a campaign speech - their interactions with each other, and how each is affected by Kennedy's presence that weekend.\nPerhaps intentionally, Estevez's film pays homage to Robert Altman's classic Nashville, which used the same ensemble-cast formula and was centered around a political speech and musical concert. Estevez wisely never follows one character for too long, lest we think the focus is on anything but the overarching theme of Change. He also doesn't swoop in for close ups of his many stars, opting for a much more realistic portrayal. The camera follows an actor as he or she moves into a new room, rather than being in the room as he or she enters. That sort of thing.\nBut here's where the movie is incredible genius. We know what happens. We know exactly how the movie is going to end. It's not a mystery; everything builds up to Kennedy's murder. And yet somehow, we're still stunned, absolutely thunderstruck when it happens. No! Not Bobby! Why? Why? I mean, I wasn't even around in 1968, and I was first captivated and then devastated by the senselessness of the killing. Bobby Kennedy, the film tells us, was more than a political candidate. He was a true unifier, a man who honestly felt bad about all the crap that had happened, the seemingly endless war in Vietnam and the intracountry violence that threatened to really tear the country apart. He campaigned not on the coattails of his martyred brother's legacy but on his own strong ideals and compassion. Everyone, it seemed, loved Kennedy - whites, blacks, Hispanics, rich people, poor people, the distaff middle class, everyone. Except, of course, for his eventual killer.\nThe cast features a lot of big names. Anthony Hopkins. Demi Moore. Martin Sheen. Christian Slater. Sharon Stone. Lindsey Lohan. Elijah Wood. Some are better known for their offscreen exploits nowadays, some haven't had much of a career in years. But Estevez manages to eke out some tremendous, galvanizing, gut-wrenching performances from everyone. Seriously, not one insincere note is sounded; there's no hamminess, no vamping, no divas, no egos. It's an acting clinic. You forget these are big Hollywood stars and can almost believe everyone's a nonactor who happens to be really, really good.\nAbove all, even with his audience knowing the precise ending, Estevez never takes away that which audiences hold most dear - hope. The assassination of Bobby Kennedy was crippling to many in 1968, and by extension the viewing audience in 2006, but even his death could not destroy the hope of getting past the bad times. When Bobby is over, you feel like you've been socked in the stomach by your dog. But then you look at your dog, and your dog looks at you, and you realize it's gonna be okay after all."}

Cruz's Oscar-nominated performance and the beautiful cinematography of Jose Luis Alcaine lift this from being more than just your run-of-the-mill double-crossing family-issues movie.\nRaimunda (Cruz) is a vivacious, busty working woman (no, not a hooker) who's married to Paco and has a teenage daughter, Paula (Yohana Cobo). Turns out Paco's a bit of an ass - as most males are in Almodovar films - and when he loses his job, his assness (yes, that is a word, now) goes off the charts. Stuff happens, and soon there's no more Paco to worry about.\nRaimunda's sister Sole (Lola Duenas), an underground hairdresser - who knew they existed? - also lives in the city; the sisters lost their parents years ago in a house fire and now spend time with their mother's sister Paula, a doddering woman who acts as if her sister is still alive. The sisters remark about how Tia Paula seems to have lost her marbles, but at least she has a neighbor looking in on her every day. And then, of course, the old woman dies.\nSounds tragic, right? Only it turns out that now people in the village are seeing Raimunda's mother, long dead, that she's appearing to them all because she needs to complete something she'd begun in life. What could it be? At first Irene appears to everyone but Raimunda, especially Sole, who takes her mother in as a hairdresser's assistant, a mute Russian. (Trust me, it makes more sense in the movie.) And while all of this is going on, Raimunda has somehow taken over the neighborhood restaurant (she was just supposed to show it to a prospective buyer while the owner was away but has opened it to cater for a film crew). SO you can see there's plenty of chaos going on in their little world.\nCruz's explosive performance as the self-centered Raimunda is the vortex of the entire film, galvanizing the other actors - not to mention a pretty snappy script, by Almodovar - into a miasma of wit and emotion. Above all else, emotion. I mean, after all, it's a Spanish movie. They don't make placid, lifeless movies in the Spanish language - check out Telemundo on any given day, and you'll see what I mean. Everyone speaks MUY RAPIDO! and with feeling! Of course, not being a native Spanish speaker works against me there. But here, not so much. Never mind the subtitles - they're helpful, but you can still get the jist of things just by watching the incredible Cruz work. She looks positively radiant and walks off with virtually every scene she's in (which would be almost all of them). Cruz's Raimunda is passionate, vibrant, beautiful and beauteous, and she's the single best reason to watch this clever, involving film that really hits its stride with a nifty twist in the final reel or so."}

No veritas.", "content": "Robert DeNiro's fictionalized account of the creation and early history of the CIA is intelligent and well intentioned, with superb casting. Its most prominent debit is in the casting of Matt Damon as its lead, Edward Wilson, the young man at the crux of the genesis of the counterintelligence agency.\nThe quiet, unassuming Wilson is a straight-arrow Yale student, part of America's upper crust, who vows to do good in the world after his father commits suicide, thus making him an easy recruit for a US general (DeNiro) who is planning a new, covert intelligence service after World War II. Wilson is stationed in London, and his cipherlike demeanor allows him to run counterintelligence for the US there, as German and Russian spies (and others) jockey for position in postwar England.\nThe movie is bookended by the leadup to the infamous Bay of Pigs incident in 1961. There has been a leak on the US side, alerting Fidel Castro to the upcoming invasion, and Wilson must determine the source of the leak. All he has to go by is a hidden-camera film and some murky audio; he doesn't know where the film was recorded, and he doesn't know who the speakers on the audio are.\nAs 1961 Wilson - by now, a seasoned espionage agent - tries to suss out what has happened, we flash back many times to his own early beginnings, how he met a young woman named Clover Russell (Angelina Jolie), how he was found by Phillip Allen (William Hurt) by way of the notorious (if it actually exists) Skull and Bones society at Yale, and how the relationship between Wilson and his son Edward, Jr., progresses over the years, as his dad is rarely home (he's gone for the first five years of Junior's life, actually).\nThe movie works not because of Damon but because of the trenchant, complex plot dreamed up by Eric Roth. This is a movie that takes a driving force of a character's personality - i.e., Wilson's patriotism - and turns it around in order to both buoy the character and bring about his downfall. Anyone as single minded as Wilson is in this movie is going to face a rude comeuppance, but at the same time his tenacity at doing the Right Thing for America, his unwavering decency, is held up as a laudable ideal.\nThe problem with Damon is the same one that's followed him throughout his career; he constantly looks unable to provide the panache that these meatier roles demand. In a sense, that's not a terrible thing here, as Wilson's unreadable countenance is perfect for a superspy: does the lack of expression mask myriad possibilities, or does it simply mean there's nothing to be seen? A more competent actor can essay a thousand thoughts without uttering a word, but with Damon one just thought there was't much there to begin with.\nHe's surrounded by a very able cast, though, helping matters considerably. Jolie sparkles in the few scenes in which she appears as Wilson's wife, as do DeNiro, Hurt, Alec Baldwin, Michael Gambon, and Timothy Hutton. Perplexingly cast was the marble-mouthed Eddie Redmayne as Edward Jr., who's as dull-looking and unintelligible as his on screen father is hunky and articulate. It'd be easy to ignore this casting faux pas, but Edward Jr. plays a big role in the final twenty minutes of the movie, sadly.\nAnother caveat: Although the movie covers a couple decades in time, Damon never ages all that realistically. Sure, he has a couple of crow's feet, but that's about it; oh, there's the time where he's inexplicably wearing what appear to be women's eyeglasses. (No, he's not undercover.) It's kind of funny (unintentionally) when you see the senior and junior Edwards near the end of the movie, and Junior looks about as old as his old man. They couldn't even pack a few more pounds on Damon? Give him a paunch, a stoop, anything? No, apparently we're supposed to go by the passage of time to show his aging, although everyone else seems a bit older - and wears it well (see, in particular, Jolie, who's absolutely wonderful, no matter her character's age).\nThe Good Shepherd is a bit too long, although the story itself is well told. A good solid cast and a followable plot make this mostly enjoyable; it loses points for unbelievable casting and the usual so-low-key-he's-almost-invisible performance by Damon."}

Kinda.", "content": "The good news is that this formulaic, high-octane action movie from Michael Bay is pretty entertaining stuff; the bad news is that it feels like it was directed by a semi-retarded spider monkey on crack. Jarring visuals, incomprehensible fight scenes, and overblown special effects are at least somewhat mitigated by appealing performances and, of course, state-of-the-art CGI.\nIn this remake of the 1985 film that was spawned by the cheesy cartoon series, evil robots have arrived on Earth to reunite with their leader, Megatron, who came to the planet a couple of millennia ago in search of the Allspark, a box of something or other that will enable Megatron and the other Decepticons to rule the universe! Only Megatron crashed into the Arctic and froze. Well, as much as a robot can freeze; he was merely paralyzed. Meanwhile, the good-guy robots from the same planet, the Autobots, have tracked Megatron to Earth, also in search of the Allspark.\nSam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf is an awkward teen who's trying to earn money to buy his first car. Of course, since he's awkward and somewhat smart, we know he's the hero. And we know who his enemies are, too, because they're the ones who laugh at him. They'll all be sorry! They're not too sorry when Sam's first car turns out to be a beat-up yellow Camaro, although they might be a little bedeviled when they find out the car's really an Autobot.\nIt's up to Sam, his new galpal Mikaela (Megan Fox), the Secretary of Defense (Jon Voight), and the U.S. Army to somehow defeat the Decepticons, who will stop at nothing to find the Allspark, even if it means exterminating all the ant-sized humans. Luckily, Sam and company also have the Autobots on their side, and a showdown of giant robot versus giant robot is ON, brother.\nOne puzzling problem with the movie is that the Autobots don't show up until a good half hour into the film. I guess this was to establish the all-important Sam-Mikaela relationship, which naturally will eventually blossom into something bigger. Because, of course, the dorky guy always gets the hot chick, even if he has to defeat giant robots to do it. But it's true, presenting the backstory of the characters before showing us the Autobots does add a more human aspect to the film; otherwise it would be just a big, violent robot-versus-robot extended fight sequence. Wait, it was that anyway.\nMichael Bay movies are not immune to clich\u00e9s; they revel in them, exploiting them to complement the loud pyrotechnics. Or maybe the loud pyrotechnics are there to distract us from the inane characterizations and dopey plot. In any event, how many movies have we in which an intern/trainee/cadet is the only one, out of literally thousands of experts, to solve the problem? How many have we seen in which someone working for the forces of Good manages to sneak something secret out of an otherwise-secure facility? On the other hand, this was one movie in which the military is actually competent; where the guys with guns know what they're doing and aren't the shoot-first, ask-questions-later types? That was surprising, and amusing.\nAnd I realize this will confirm me as a cranky old man, no matter my chronological age, but what was UP with all of the loud music? Every scene was shot as if it were a crappy heavy-metal video, circa 1986. Grating guitars turned up to eleven on the volume control drowned out some dialog and a lot of sound effects, such as robots doing robotic things. Add that to the hyperactive zooming, panning, and scanning, and this is certainly not a movie that an epileptic should ever watch.\nNor is it a movie that young kids should watch, in all honesty. Transformers is rated PG-13, but it's pretty violent; the only thing that's lacking is actual blood. People get blown up, smashed, crushed, and shot by robots, and it's pretty intense stuff. So be careful when bringing little Timmy to this one, unless you want to put up with a week of nightmares and nocturnal enuresis. This ain't the Transformers you grew up with."}

In an Oscar-nominated performance, O'Toole plays Maurice Russell, a veteran of stage and screen in the twilight of his existence who unexpectedly finds himself falling for a woman fifty years younger than him. It's a classic romance.\nEvery day, Maurice comes 'round to visit his friend Ian, also a longtime actor, who is convalescing. Ian has procured for himself someone to take care of him, the daughter of his niece. Jessie (Jodie Whittaker) is in her early twenties and is aimless, jobless, and even somewhat expressionless, and it's not long before she and Ian are locking horns. From the moment Maurice sets eyes on the girl, she's either stuffing her face or guzzling some of Ian's booze. Oh, and she wants to be a model.\nMaurice becomes quite taken with the girl, although the feeling certainly doesn't seem to be mutual. But really, how could it be? Maurice is supposed to be in his seventies (although here O'Toole looks about 95), and Jessie is in her twenties. When you were in your twenties, didn't anyone at least old enough to be your father seem, you know, kind of decrepit in your mind? There's simply no realistic scenario that would have Jessie falling madly in love with Maurice, and thankfully that never really happens.\nBut then what exactly does Jessie see in Maurice? Well, for one thing, as Ian dislikes her on sight, Maurice is kind and giving - he even attempts to find a modeling job for her, albeit as a nude model. He calls Jessie \"Venus\" because of a painting they see depicting the goddess. (Hey, it's as good a reason as any.) So there's sort of a symbiotic relationship going on - Jessie gets support from Maurice, because Ian is better able to put up with her if Maurice is on her side, and Maurice gets to leer at her with a crooked grin. That might have been appealing, say, twenty years ago, but Peter O'Toole looks wan and about to keel over. I know, that's how the character was supposed to look anyway, but the whole relationship felt a little creepy, to be honest. Perhaps that's why Jessie isn't painted as a complete innocent but rather as a young woman reveling in her many flaws.\nThis was O'Toole's eighth Oscar nomination (he's never won), and he did deserve it - his Maurice is elegant, whimsical, charming, and lecherous, all traits associated with O'Toole in real life. O'Toole brings quite a bit of gravitas and wit to an otherwise lightweight, pedestrian role, and his mere presence livened up every scene. Whittaker, surprisingly, is certainly his equal, matching her famous costar in even their most intimate, lowest-key scenes.\nSpeaking of which, I had to fuss with the volume several times. Some of the scenes are SO low key that you can't hear what anyone's saying, and yet in other scenes the volume's at normal level. It's as if the director thought that merely having his fine actors recite serious lines in a serious setting was not enough, so he made them mumble them, too. A little irritating.\nAll in all, this is a slow movie that strives to find great, deep meaning in Relationships, Aging, and Death but fails to completely deliver on any of them."}

Of course not. Even twelve years after his last appearance, McClane is still the all-American, G.I. Joe, Bad Guy killah with a soft spot for his family but also for Doing the Right Thing. Here, he's up against a madman (Timothy Olyphant) bent on virtually hacking his way into the U.S. infrastructure to prove some kind of point, or something. Whatever. It doesn't matter. All that matter is that McClane kicks ass. That's all we want to see.\nAll McClane has to do, see, is pick up a kid in Camden, New Jersey, and schlep him down to Washington in the middle of the night. Sounds like a job for a rookie cop, right, but of course a senior detective was requested. And it seems this kid, Matt Farrell (Justin Long) is some kind of super-sekrit hacker dude person who's wanted for questioning by the FBI, something about a major attack on government computers earlier that day. Of course, other people are looking for Farrell (i.e., the bad guys), and they blow everything up trying to get him and, by extension, McClane. They fail.\nThen the madman, Thomas Gabriel, sets his evil, evil plan further in motion by causing all of the traffic lights in DC to go green. Cackling with glee, he causes the stocks at the NYSE to plummet! Mass chaos ensues! Meanwhile, McClain's trying to shepherd his young charge to various government offices, trying to find a safe place for him. There aren't any.\nOf course, at some point it gets personal between McClane and Gabriel, so the bad guy nabs McClane's teenage daughter, Lucy. Why do bad guys do this? Do they really think the hero will be all, \"Oops, you win, I give up!\" because his family's in jeopardy? Don't evil villains watch movies? Gabriel's lucky, though, because he has a chief minion who can kick ass, Mai (Maggie Q). Naturally, at some point she goes womano-a-mano with McClane, but the only reason she does as well as she does is that a) she's a woman, so she's not your typical henchman and b) she knows kung fu. I mean, of course she does, she's Asian. They all know that stuff, right? A lot of things blow up. You might have seen the trailer, in which McClane speeds a cop car out of a tunnel, and jumps out at the last minute as the car slams into the side of a hovering helicopter. Pretty nifty stuff, if not even a little believable. Often, McClane will do something that winds up hurting him pretty bad, with blood dripping down his face and all, but he's fine, no, let him just walk it off.. or jump down a flight of stairs, or run down the street. It's all good, because he's the hero. We expect him to shrug off pain and injury to vital organs. But when the pilot of the chopper falls at least thirty feet and is perfectly okay, I dunno, I'm a little skeptical.\nBut it's okay, because little implausibilities won't bother you. The thing to note is that Willis, his smirk, his I-ain't-taking-no-crap attitude, they're all back. And, good news, there aren't a lot of side comments about McClane's age, mostly because he kicks the asses of people half as old. Willis looks like he's still in tip top fighting shape. He's not paunchy, or graybearded. He looks a lot like he did in 1995, so good on him.\nWonderful visual effects and another gritty, appealing, and above all fresh performance from Willis, who clearly looks into the role - he's not sleepwalking through it, as you might expect an aging action star to do, just collecting a paycheck. I swear, the man looks like he's enjoying getting shot at. He rocks. But it wouldn't matter how into the role Willis was if the plot was too convoluted to follow, or too simplistic to warrant attention, or if the rest of the cast was so wooden that you kind of wished they'd all get mowed down. And that's where Long came in. Part victim, part sidekick, total hacker, Long was perfectly cast, a good complement - useful without being annoying. Tough to find people like that in action movies."}

If you think of The Good German as one of those cheesy propaganda cheapies made in the forties and fifties, the stench of overwrought schlock might be a bit more palatable. Well, maybe - if you also downed some cheap scotch in the process.\nJacob (George Clooney) is a writer for the fledgling New Republic who zips over to Berlin to cover the close of The Big One. Tully (Tobey Maguire) is Jacob's driver, an opportunistic ne'er-do-well who's deeply involved in the black market, the little scamp. Tully's girlfriend is Lena (Cate Blanchett), a prostitute who sees Tully as a way out of Germany forever. Might a romantic triangle, full of lust and intrigue, develop? Maybe not. Soon, Tully's face down in the river, and everyone's trying to find Lena's presumed-dead husband, including the Russian and American military.\nI can appreciate what Steven Soderbergh was trying to do here - he wanted to recreate that ultracool 1940s cinema atmosphere, one in which everyone's attitude and demeanor are as black and white as the cinematography itself, and everyone chainsmokes. But in a weird concession to the present day, there's a ton of profanity. Why would you go to all of the trouble of creating this throwback atmosphere and then screw it up by tossing in anachronistic cursing? Did Soderbergh feel he needed to sex up the movie a little? What, German prostitutes aren't enough? And I can also appreciate casting decisions as much as the next guy - Clooney as Hero isn't really a stretch for him, though - but who the heck thought Tobey Maguire belonged in this movie? Put it this way - when the woman has a deeper, more masculine voice than the man, Something Is Wrong. Maguire's voice sounds like it's going to crack at any moment. He's in way over his head, since this is a movie that requires some range. See how good you are without a mask on, Mr. Spider-Man! Much of the movie involves Jacob running around Berlin, trying to piece together everything, while being thwarted by, well, everyone, including Lena, who lies constantly. It got to the point where I half-expected her to say she wasn't much of a smoker. But regardless of the endless lies, Jake fervently believes Lena's pure and innocent and just a goshdarn victim of circumstances. Which means, of course, that she's not.\nThe movie tries shamelessly to ape Casablanca, but Clooney is no Bogie. He's always been compared to Cary Grant, a suave good guy who's in a little over his head, but that's not what this movie needed; it needed an oily, morally ambiguous bastard. Someone who might indeed screw over other people to further his own gains, or not. For some reason Steve Buscemi's name kept popping into my head. At any rate, Clooney's just not the man for the job here - he looks too pretty.\nOn the other hand, Blanchett is about as perfect as you can get. Not hammy, not too understated, just fantastic. I liked her - mysterious, callous, believable. She reminds one of Ingrid Bergman, and it's quite a favorable comparison.\nPerhaps if Soderbergh had not decided to rip off (er, I mean, pay homage to) the cloak-and-dagger postwar films of the olden days, concentrating on filming a believable, cohesive plot; or maybe going all the way with his homage and not having profanity laced throughout, this might have made more sense. It does pick up a bit about halfway through, but everyone seems so intent on being Grand Actors that the result isn't very entertaining. I mean, heck, when Tobey Maguire kicks George Clooney not once, your movie has some serious credibility problems."}

One of the men, Jaguar Paw, must escape and make his way back to his pregnant, trapped wife and their young son.\nIn all honesty, if Mel Gibson's name hadn't been attached to this movie, if there hadn't been so much attention paid to the film because of its violence level, its big budget, its on-location shooting, and its reliance on the ancient Mayan language, this might have been another largely forgotten film set in a foreign land during an indeterminate time period.\nThe violence is very brutal and jarring (114 on-screen deaths), but that's as it should be. Gibson doesn't want us to view the tribulations of this particular tribe as disinterested souls watching a Hollywood blockbuster, he wants us to understand how perilous every aspect of their lives was, how strong they needed to be, both physically and mentally, and how important one's family and friends can be.\nThe beginning scenes had me a little skeptical, because the comedy was a little broad. How broad, you ask? The tribesmen make mother-in-law jokes. No, I'm serious. There's a nagging old hag who keeps haranguing her son in law about making a grandbaby for her, and he's impotent. Oh, and there's a bit about someone getting tricked into rubbing a painful ointment onto his private parts. You know, intellectual humor.\nBut that quickly dissipates, as the tattooed, bejeweled, and totally armed-and-dangerous warriors attack, beating, slaying, and torturing the members and putting the entire hamlet to the torch. Jaguar Paw, who'd dreamed of the attack, awakens just as the intruders arrive and is able to stow his wife and child at the bottom of a pit. This safety is somewhat short lived, however, when one of the warriors notices the rope that was to allow them to escape the pit - and cuts it off.\nDon't watch this if you can't stand women in peril, or if you can't stand watching people sacrificed to the gods. Come to think of it, the woman-in-peril bit is just a mask - turns out that Jaguar Paw's wife, Seven, is extremely tough, inside and out, and her resilience and fortitude give her and her child a fighting chance.\nThe focus is on Jaguar Paw, though, and how he gains almost superhuman abilities as he dodges headhunters and wild animals in his quest to return to his loved ones. That might sound implausible, but as most parents know that when your child's health is in jeopardy, it's possible to do things you never thought you could do.\nI don't see this as quite the epic that Gibson was going for, but his directorial touches lend quite a bit of panache and anxiety to the proceedings. Some of the action shots of Jaguar Paw running through his beloved forest, pursued by bad men, are seamless, jaw-dropping views, allowing us to figure out Jaguar Paw's on-the-fly plans right after he does. Gibson's style, along with the cinematography of Dean Selmer and the performance by Rudy Youngblood keep this movie afloat; the conclusion, while lacking the intensity of the rest of the movie, is satisfying."}

He's stayed in hotels and inns and B&Bs all across the country and has not, he says, ever seen evidence of paranormal behavior. Even so, he's managed to make a somewhat modest living writing about his experiences. He's a cynic, as most writers are, but Enslin is not only skeptical about things, he outright doesn't believe in anything, owing in no small part to an earlier tragedy in his life.\nAnd then one day he finds a postcard in his mail from the Dolphin Hotel in New York. There's but one sentence on the back: \"Don't go into Room 1408.\" Enslin's research then shows that numerous people have died in that particular hotel room - people jumping to their deaths, people slashing their own throats, gouging their own eyes, and so on. Pretty creepy stuff. But since that's sort of par for the course in Enslin's line of work, he doesn't think much of it and manages to wrangle a reservation in the infamous room.\nThe hotel's manager, Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) tries desperately to talk Enslin out of staying in the room overnight. No one lasts more than an hour, he warns. Olin points out that many people have died in 1408 of *natural* causes, too - bringing the death toll to 56. Olin even offers Enslin a rare bottle of booze and the chance to read up on the history of the room, anything to keep Enslin from actually going into the room. He fails.\nAnd who could blame Enslin for being a wee bit skeptical that 1408 is anything to be scared of? He's been in so many places just like the Dolphin, from seedy motels to high-rise palaces, and he's never seen anything all that terrifying, and certainly nothing that couldn't be explained away easily enough. And then he steps into 1408, and all hell breaks loose.\nIt appears to be such an ordinary room, a fact that Enslin notes into his dictaphone. But then it gets hot, and the window slams shut on his fingers, and he hears a baby crying, and most importantly, the digital clock radio seems to be counting down from one hour - even after he forcibly yanks it from the wall outlet. Before you know it, ghosts from his own past are appearing in his room alongside the ghosts of those who'd died there themselves.\nThe greatest part about all of this is that while Enslin's mind is being tortured, smacked around like a tetherball hooked to a pole of sanity, we're suffering right along with him. We jump when he jumps - and not before he jumps. He feel like screaming just as he does. We're right there with him through ever shiver, every shudder, every wide-eyed gulp of terror. Enslin isn't merely frazzled, he's undone. Even he can't explain the happenings inside 1408 as creaky floorboards or bad wiring. The horror in the room is personal, reducing even the cockiest skeptic into a pile of blubbering goo.\nCusack, whom I think is one of the finest actors of his generation, is absolutely aces. His idiom is that he's an Everyman, not someone to whom superhuman powers have been conveyed. Throw another actor into the movie, and you'd expect him to grit his teeth and wipe out the unseen enemies with a blowtorch and some grenades, but not Cusack. Cusack's Enslin doesn't know how to deal with the psychological warfare, because neither would we.\nThat ripping sound you just heard? It was your sanity departing right after Enslin's.\n***1/2"}

Walter drags Kitty to China partly to punish her for her illicit tryst with a married man (Liev Schrieber). Kitty agrees because somehow facing cholera is somehow better than being divorced and disgraced by Walter.\nNow, I like Edward Norton. But having too recently seen him in The Illusionist, I was a little wary of his work here; Walter is not presented as someone who can be fooled, least of not by someone as apparently dumb as Kitty, and sure enough he's discovered her infidelity. Of course, looking at Walter, one can understand Kitty's indiscretion; she's outgoing and adventurous, whereas Walter is dull and lifeless. He snags her after a truly whirlwind courtship and whisks her away from England to foreign lands; she agrees for the adventure and to get away from her sanctimonious, image-conscious mother.\nIn China, Walter finds that his abilities as a scientist aren't the cure-all elixir the area needs. As the epidemic spreads, Walter necessarily cuts off the town's tainted water supply, thus provoking wrath against all Westerners. Meanwhile, Kitty bores of sitting around the house and helps a local orphanage. But can they both keep the cholera at arm's length? Can their shared experiences save their marriage? This is, at its heart, a love story, although perhaps not the most exciting one. I can't honestly say that anything in this movie really bothered me, but neither did it particularly enflame any passions for me. This is not a movie that most guys are going to like. Sure, Naomi Watts is good to look at, and she's a competent actress, but here she seems like just another pretty face. The story's focus is on her, but unless you're in just the right mood you probably won't be grabbed by it.\nThose of you who love romances, though, might swoon. The bored wife has to cheat on her husband! He finds out and takes her to a place where surely she will die of cholera, if not ennui! Can this marriage be saved? That Edward Norton, he's so dashing and confident! OK, maybe not so dashing, but he looks good in a suit or a lab coat. He's like the Superman of nerdy Everymen. The fact that here he basically tries to kill her (i.e., by bringing her into an epidemic of a highly contagious disease) kind of takes some of the shine away.\nThe Chinese scenery is wonderful, though, and everyone seems earnest enough. But it was all maddening dull for me, up until the final twenty minutes or so, when the chemistry of the two leads really clicked. Overall, not a complete miss by any means, but not to everyone's taste, particularly those of us who are impatient."}

I mean, after the crap effort of Ocean's Twelve, who could expect anything, well, good? The last one just felt like a bunch of buddy celebs getting together from some yuks and a good ol' time. But Thirteen tries very hard to make you forget Twelve ever happened, and it largely succeeds.\nThis time around, the boys are out to avenge their good pal Rueben (Elliot Gould), who's been doublecrossed by the nefarious Willie Bank (Al Pacino). Reuben invested heavily in Bank's new, colossal casino in Vegas, but then Bank screwed Rueben out of his share, defrauding him of zillions. The general plan that Danny Ocean (George Clooney) has come up with is to ruin Bank's opening night on many levels - fix games, cause natural disasters, steal his diamonds, make sure the casino reviewer has a bad time, that sort of thing.\nGone are the self-indulgent overtones of Twelve, as the series returns to its roots as a crisply written caper punctuated by self-effacing performances and a wild, yet not implausible, plot. And, even better, there are times when I actually laughed out loud. I know! Whoda thunk that? The good news is that through three movies, the main characters haven't changed; they haven't grown, they're not evolving into higher beings, nothing. They are simply who they are. Danny is the leader, a man cool under pressure but not smugly so - kind of like George Clooney offscreen, come to think of it. Well, from what I've heard. Rusty (Brad Pitt) is still his right-hand man. Linus (Matt Damon) appears to be #3, but he's just as much of a doofus as he's always been (this time around, his father makes an appearance). Most of the other guys - including the timeless Carl Reiner as Sol - get short shrift, but whaddya gonna do when you have eleven, twelve, whatever, guys? They can't all get the good lines.\nOne pleasant surprise is that Pacino reins himself in a bit. He's not all eyes-bugging-out mad, like he was in Scarface, or Devil's Advocate, or Any Given Sunday, or a million other movies; no, he's more laid back, but totally in control. Apparently Pacino was the guy that director Steven Soderbergh wanted all along, and he does a damn good job - it's always good to see Al being a Good Actor instead of a ham. Along for the ride is another name actor, Ellen Barkin, who I'm told once was pretty attractive. At any rate, she's Bank's right-hand woman, a sort of Team Evil counterpart to Rusty; Barkin's Sponder is punctual, efficient, and poured into a slinky breast-baring (almost) dress at all times. Arm candy never hurts, thinks Bank. But beware! For some reason Soderbergh gives us a couple of closeups of Barkin. Hide the children! Or use the opportunity to warn them about the dangers of plastic surgery.\nOkay, enough Barkin bashing, and back to the story. Ocean has all of the angles covered, but at the eleventh hour he finds himself in need of major fundage. Everyone's tapped out, of course, so to whom can they turn but Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), the entrepreneur that the Ocean gang beat in the first two films. It's good to see Garcia, and at least his character's appearance here isn't contrived. Well, not too contrived - they didn't know anyone else who could spot them $36 million? Eh, guess not.\nThe one character who annoys me in these movies is Linus Caldwell. He's a pest to Danny and Rusty; although he supposedly has talents, he seems to spend a lot of time being a pain in the ass to everyone. When he comes up with an idea, everyone's shocked, and when he's supposed to be accomplishing something, he fails. At least here his noodginess is less obtrusive than it was in Twelve, when Linus actually ran a plan of his own device. I wonder if the character is supposed to be endearing, almost adorable in how inept he is - if so, though, then Damon really sucks, as the result is that I wish Linus would be killed off.\nStill. Ocean's Thirteen is lots of fun, way more funner than Twelve, and it helps that the bad guy has a strong, pervasive personality that prevents predictability. I think that, as Soderbergh and Clooney have said, this one makes up for the crap that came before it."}

It's the story of George Reeves (Ben Affleck), who played Superman back in the day. Some time after his TV show was cancelled, Reeves was found dead of a supposedly self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. History and the LAPD would have us believe it was a suicide, but in this movie there are some doubters, like George's mom (Lois Smith).\nOn the case is down-on-his-luck investigator Louis Simo (Adrien Brody), who sniffs out the case when LAPD closes the book on it. He convinces Reeves' mom to let him look into it. You half expect the terminally unshaven Simo to chug a bottle of rotgut and pass out in a gutter (he comes close), all the while puffing on a butt he found in the street.\nThe movie switches from Simo's investigation in the present (the movie's present, not ours) to George Reeves' life and loves in the past. Reeves, it seems, was not particularly proud of being the Man of Steel, even though it brought joy to many children. Like many actors, he wanted to be more. He wanted big roles, he wanted to direct - George Reeves was, essentially, a discontented dreamer. Reeves' relationship with his wealthy benefactor, Toni Mannix (Diane Lane), is also examined at length. Reeves was a struggling actor who couldn't land a job when he was noticed/picked up by the older Mrs. Mannix in a posh Hollywood restaurant. Even though he's a little out of her league, George falls for Toni. And yes, I said Mrs. Mannix. Toni is married to the head of MGM, Eddie Mannix (Bob Hoskins), who knows full well about Toni and George, because he has his own mistress.\nDirector Allan Coulter effectively juxtaposes Reeves' career tribulations with Simo's sleuthing, such as it is. What made George Reeves tick? Was he despondent at all in his last days, or did he have much to live for? Did he have enemies? And why, above all, did his career stagnate? One possible answer to this last question could be found at the screening of From Here to Eternity, for which Reeves scored a bit part - his first \"serious\" work after playing Superman. Everyone in the theater is enthralled by the movie... until Reeves shows up. \"That's Superman!\" one whispers. \"Where's his cape?\" snickers another. Reeves is humiliated.\nBrody is earnest as Simo, but he sometimes seems to be reading off cue cards, showing little passion or energy in the role. I've liked him in other things, like The Jacket and even King Kong, but he just seemed to be going through the motions at times here. Conversely, Affleck was surprisingly solid as the debonair hunky-hunk Reeves, both cocksure and self-conscious, willing to be led by a moneyed older woman but also to take risks to be his own man. If anything, a role like 1950s Superman is right up Affleck's metaphorical alley - a pretty boy whose visage seems to evoke truth, justice, and the American way. You know, pompadoured Hollywoodism. Affleck does well with the acting part, too, and he has genuine chemistry with Lane - not to mention Robin Tunney, who plays Reeves' love interest as well.\nAnother slight debit is a running secondary plot involving Simo's young son and how he deals with the death of his TV idol (i.e., he acts out). This could have been an interesting sidebar, but the whole thread is treated rather superficially. I mean, I get it - Simo is a lousy dad and husband and doesn't get the significance of the kid's hero killing himself. (Although it should be noted that there's a memorable, unsettling scene in which a kid approaches Reeves after a live Superman show - with a real gun! That scene is very well written and acted. Shame the rest of the theme wasn't.) The movie was \"inspired\" by the real-life circumstances surrounding Reeves' death, so probably many liberties were taken. Reeves' death was ruled a suicide, and it's unclear that anyone's seriously entertained the notion that he was bumped off. But beyond that, the ending itself is unsatisfying - knowing that it wasn't necessarily being told as it really happened, I was hoping there would be some kind of closure, a denouement that points to a particular killer. But it's left pretty open ended - the killer could have been anyone, or George. Nothing's really resolved, which makes one think that the previous 90 minutes or so were rather pointless."}

This time, it\u2019s three dimwitted female Americans, whereas last time it was two dimwitted male Americans and their equally dimwitted European friend. It\u2019s these differences that are necessary for a sequel to separate itself from its progenitor.\nAs in the first movie, the Americans are lured to a lurid youth hostel in Slovakia, whereupon they\u2019re to be tortured in inventive manners by rich businessmen from around the world. The young women are Beth (Lauren German), the smart-but-cute one (not too pretty but certainly not a fugly); Whitney (Bijou Phillips), the mean-and-skanky one; and Lorna (Heather Matarazzo), the shy, sneezy one. (There you go, the Three Clueless Dwarfs: Smarty, Skanky, and Sneezy.)The girls are headed to Prague when a sexy stranger (Vera Jordanova) tells them about therapeutic hot springs in Slovakia. Being raised to be cautious around strangers, the girls don\u2019t decide to take their new friend\u2019s advice until they\u2019ve all had some time for girl talk.\nOnly one true spirit can survive a horror movie, and it\u2019s pretty easy to figure out who\u2019s being positioned as the Good Guy who will live to see Hostel 3: Robots in Your Bedroom. By the same token, it\u2019s also easy to see who among the bad, evil torturing rich dudes will turn out to be hunky dory. We know this because there\u2019s an inordinate amount of time spent on the two guys who win the auction that gives them the right to torture Beth and Whitney. One of the guys seems reticent, almost unsure whether he wants to get into this business at all, while his buddy is gung-ho and ready to start some creepy pain-giving.\nThe method that the secret torture society uses is unchanged; they plant young travelers in the hostel and pay them to lure the tourists to their doom. The hostel itself is complicit, as the creepy-looking desk clerk scans the girls\u2019 passports and puts their pictures on the auction site, thus setting the bidding in motion. And they would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren\u2019t for these meddling kids. Oh, wait, that implies they don\u2019t get away with it.\nBlah, blah, blah, the kids get separated, despite all omens of Bad Things Afoot. I mean, look, they\u2019re alone in a foreign country, and most of the citizens don\u2019t speak English. They\u2019re the very picture of Ugly Americans, in that they think nothing could possibly happen to them, no matter how loutish they behave. It does not speak well for the movie when you quickly hope not only that they\u2019re captured and tortured but that it\u2019s sooner rather than later. You\u2019re supposed to be rooting for these three girls (yeah, I know, they\u2019re technically women, but they don\u2019t act like it), and yet they\u2019re so annoying, so steadfastly stupid, and so perfectly one dimensional that you openly wish for their demise. Bad start.\nWhen we finally do get to the torture scenes, our rooting interest hasn\u2019t really changed, although we know in our hearts that our feisty girls are going to come out on top somehow. Well, at least one of them, anyway. As with the first movie, there are some truly garish gore scenes; this isn\u2019t a movie for those with weak constitutions, although oddly enough no one throws up on screen. Just lots and lots and lots of blood.\nThe movie feels particularly misogynistic, too; in the first one, the guys were ultimately killed because they were simply overpowered and outwitted and outgunned by the bad guys, but in this one the girls suffer because they are dumb and flighty and self-absorbed. Here\u2019s a good indication of how bad the movie is - people are killed, tortured, maimed, what have you, but what REALLY sets off our heroine is a certain four-letter word that begins with the letter C. Yes, up till that point - when she\u2019d been shackled and humiliated - she was as tolerant as she could be, but man, once the Bad Guy calls her a C-word, oh NO HE DIDN\u2019T! At that point you just know she\u2019s gonna be okay, and he might not be.\nThere\u2019s an interesting opening bit that ties the end of the first film to this one, but that\u2019s about the only connection there is between the two, other than the general rich-American-kids-get-tortured-and-killed bit. It\u2019s actually one of the more suspenseful and powerful scenes in the entire movie. But overall this is a dead movie, listlessly throwing buckets of blood at the audience in hopes that something goopy will stick. It\u2019s a prime example of a sequel that\u2019s been mailed in, what with a nearly identical plot. There are a couple of twists tossed in to keep things mildly interesting, but it\u2019s all for nothing. And the ending is completely unnecessary, other than to prepare us for the next installment of a so-called franchise that should have quit at one."}

Hey, we've all done that, right? No? Just me? Okay, then.\nAnyway, Lucas' aggression has taken its toll on the ants, disrupting their food supply chain. Ant wizard (!) Zoc (Nicolas Cage) decides to literally cut Lucas down to size, shrinking him with some sort of shrinky dink potion, and poof, the bitter lil' menace is teeny weeny. The better for him to learn the value of an insect's life, you see. It's all part of the plan.\nNow, Lucas must, in the words of the ant queen, become an ant, one of the colony. Why this must be the case isn't quite clear, but it's not terribly important. The ants don't need him, but even so he's taken under the gentle mandibles of Hova (Julia Roberts), who wants to learn more about the human, rather than simply regarding Lucas as an enemy who must be smushed. Of course, the other ants in the colony are more inclined to believe the latter than the former, but the queen and the head of council (Meryl Streep and Ricardo Montalban, respectively) have spoken.\nTo add to the drama, Lucas - feeling shunted aside by everyone in his family - somehow signed a contract with a nefarious, take-no-prisoners exterminator (Paul Giamatti) while his parents are away. Can he save his newfound pals from the deadly exterminator? A-duh.\nThe Ant Bully is charming and funny, and the animation is well detailed. Although sometimes the movie seems kind of clich\u00e9d (the fight against the exterminator is straight out of Over the Hedge's final battle), it won't matter to the target audience. The characters' voices are well cast, too, even Cage's. As with most cartoons nowadays, there's a Moral to the Story, but it's not heavy handed and off putting. And the jokes are sometimes complex enough for adults to laugh at loud at 'em."}

But then it hits you: cold, calculating, emotionless.. why, this is what Costner does best! All is saved.\nCostner is Earl Brooks, respected community leader, businessman, father, husband, and he's also the notorious Thumbprint Killer, so called because of his penchant for making his victims leave a thumbprint posthumously. He does this because he's addicted to killing - yes, the movie almost tries to make Brooks into a victim. I guess it's the writers' way of making him seem human, not some random killing machine, but whatever. I can almost buy it. Brooks kinda, sorta doesn't wanna kill people any more, but his alter ego Marshall (William Hurt) knows otherwise.\nA few things complicate Brooks' addiction. His last killing was witnessed and photographed by a man (Dane Cook) who wants to tag along for the next slaying. Plus, Brooks' daughter is dropping out of college. And an intrepid detective (Demi Moore) is hot on his trail. And all the while, he has Marshall in his ear, egging him on, acting as some kind of diabolical Jiminy Cricket.\nJudging from the trailer and various synopses, I thought this would be a cat-and-mouse game between Brooks and the detective. But it's not, not really; Moore's character, Atwood, spends some of her time tracking the Thumbprint Killer, some of her time dealing with her divorce proceedings, some of her time being stalked by a recent prison escapee. It's almost as if she's in a different film, one in which she's the lead character. Oddly enough, Atwood and Brooks don't even have a scene together.\nThrough it all, Costner's pretty effective. Like I said, this role's really right up his alley. He doesn't have to be Angry Kevin or Happy Kevin, because his character is supposed to be emotionless - even his \"normal\" character, the businessman of the year, because, well, he's a businessman, and all he thinks about are numbers. So, true to the character, right? Sure. A lot of people have criticized Costner for his acting ability, and there's surely good reason for that, but I think he's fine as long as he stays within those quiet, unassuming roles. That's why Dances with Wolves was good - he was a man of few words. And Open Range, and Bull Durham. Those were within ol' Kevin's purview.\nDemi Moore spends much of the movie trying to look earnest. I had a little more trouble accepting her as a dedicated, decorated cop. Of course, we don't know much about her character aside from an semi-important plot point revealed late in the movie, but her role was one that required a range of emotions. Atwood isn't a killing machine, she's a thinker! She thinks and catches evildoers! But what's she thinking about? What's her motivation? Tell you who I did like for sure, though, William Hurt. Marshall's not unhinged here, and he's not totally in command of Mr. Brooks. He and Brooks discuss things, and sometimes one makes more sense than the other, but Marshall is just reined in enough to make him seem like a normal, albeit imaginary, person.\nOverall, it's not a bad movie, just a little long and lacking enough twists to make it an effective thriller, which I guess is what it was aiming for. Apparently Costner has said this is intended to be the first in a trilogy, but I'm having trouble seeing it."}

It doesn't always work.\nClocking in at 165 minutes, \"At World's End\" contains several endings too many. \"Ah,\" you think, \"that's the end!\" and then more stuff happens, and you fall asleep. It's as if the producer (Jerry Bruckheimer, of course) looked at the clock, noticed that a mere two hours had elapsed, and ordered his writing minions to crank out more implausibles to stretch the running time for no apparent reason.\nSo. Did I like the movie, you wonder? Well, I sat through nearly three hours of it, so I suppose I should find something positive to say. Things blew up, and that was awesome. Plus, I decided that Keira Knightley was far manlier than Orlando Bloom, who I'm told is actually a man. (No, seriously!) And that Johnny Depp wears mascara better than Knightley, who's apparently not a little boy.\nAll kidding aside, the biggest problem with the movie is that it's overplotted. We make fun of dumb action movies that have minimal plot and are basically excuses for explosions, but here's the mirror image - there's so much going on that the typical viewer will be confused and disoriented. Which is good, I suppose, in that it'll distract him or her from the actual storyline problems.\nWhen we last left the Good Guys, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) had been claimed by Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) and imprisoned in (believe it or not) Davy Jones' Locker. The resurrected Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Will Turner (Bloom), and Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) must rescue him. To do so, they have to team up with or defeat or betray Singapore's own legendary pirate, Sao Feng (the wonderful Chow Yun-Fat), as well as various Pirate Lords, the British navy, and so on.\nThe biggest problem facing Barbossa is that the one force that can help him and the other Pirate Lords against the likes of Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) is that of an ancient goddess, who has been bound to a human body for years and years. Barbossa wants to unleash the goddess in hopes that she'll aid them all, but clear thinkers around him are more of the mind that she'll instead beat the snot out of them for imprisoning her in the first place. Of course, this being a loud action movie, there's no way in heck she's going to stay bound in a human body, right? Hilarity ensues.\nThe cast is game, but typically wooden performances by Bloom and Knightley are countered by an equally typically nuanced and often hysterical one by Depp - not to mention a bombastic, scene-stealing turn by Rush. But plot oddities abound. Elizabeth seems awash in makeup that never, ever comes off or smudges in the teeniest, despite one protracted scene taking place in a torrential downpour. I also liked the time Elizabeth was ambushed by British soldiers, one of whom puts her in a headlock; when she recognizes one of the other soldiers, Elizabeth merely throws off her captor's arm and escapes. Why she didn't do this throughout the movie, when she was in constant peril or capture, is a mystery. Or how the entire British navy, upon seeing one of their own ships decimated by pirates, says, \"the hell with this,\" and sails away.\nAs I implied, though, the movie's murky plot is its ultimate downfall. Who's on whose side? You know going in that there will be treachery, but when a movie has every character essentially turning on every other character, the whole novelty of the doublecross is long since vanished. After a while, you come to expect someone doing someone else wrong, all the more so if those two characters sort of were on the same side at one point earlier in the series. Once you tune out important details like who's on which side, the movie's sort of lost its way.\nAnd here's more bad news. The conventional wisdom in Hollywood now is that franchise films should be three movies long, no more, that three's about the limit for the typical moviegoer. But the ending very strongly hints that there will be a fourth Pirates movie. This might wind up being wishful thinking on the part of Bruckenheimer and director Gore Verbinski (who have done all three movies), rather than reality, as the second and third movies were filmed simultaneously.\nAll in all, this is a butt-numbing disappointment. If you gotta make it long, make it worth my while. If you're gonna have crap blow up, make it interesting. If you're gonna have double and triple crosses, make me care."}

He bought a whole bunch of them years ago and has been selling them to doctors and hospitals ever since, only sales have stagnated somewhat, and he's struggling big time. Now, me, in this situation, might, perhaps, get another job, one that paid something, anything to keep food on the table for my wife (Thandie Newton) and son (Jaden Smith).\nBut Chris isn't like me. Instead, after bumping into a rich-looking white dude, he decides he wants to be a stockbroker and applies (after many contrivances) for an internship at Dean Witter. Only, oops! It's not a paying internship! But Chris doesn't know that, and neither does wife Linda, who works double shifts at a hospital. Are you seeing the picture here? The mother works her hands to the bone, the dad is a shiftless loser who can't sell crappy scanners that no one needs, and what's the wise papa do? Why, chases a dream. Because if there's any time that's just made for chasing dreams, it's when you have a wife and kids and are a couple months behind in your rent and haven't paid your taxes yet for the year.\nNaturally, after Chris makes this decision and when the scanner sales slow down even more, Linda has enough and bolts for some nebulous waitressing job on the other side of the country. Up until this point, she was easily the stronger, more viable, and more responsible of the parents. But then we wouldn't get this touching plot of a father bonding with his son, so out goes Linda. (Yes, I know this is based on a true story, but I imagine some of these plot devices are fictions from the screenwriter.) Speaking of plot devices, as Chris blows off landlord after landlord, he and young Christopher are kicked out of their home, and then a motel, and they sleep on buses, in bathrooms, anywhere. This is supposed to show how Chris will suffer for his son, that he loves him so much and is trying so hard to make his life better. The trouble is, nearly all of Chris's problems were caused by... you guessed it, Chris himself. We can all relate, I'm sure, to The Man keeping us down; we struggle and make a little progress, only to be pushed back down by creditors, Johnny Law, our bosses, and so on. Sometimes fate does conspire against us. But it didn't feel like that was wholly the case here. Chris is outraged to get a notice from the IRS placing a lien on his bank account. Why is he outraged? Linda even reminded him to take care of the taxes, and Chris actively said he'd just keep filing extensions. This is no one's fault but Chris Gardner's.\nThe trouble is, you really want to feel for Chris. He knows that if he works hard and is fortunate, he can emerge from the unpaid internship with a paid job as a broker at Dean Witter. A great goal to have, of course. It just seems strange that he felt that the most viable option to him was to work as a stockbroker. He couldn't take a menial job or two to scrape up enough money to pay taxes or, heck, rent a room? God forbid. In a telling scene, Chris explodes outside a mission that had just announced it had no more room. I'm paraphrasing, but as Chris argued with a man who'd cut in front of him in line (thus denying him entrance to the mission), he mentions that he had to run from his job to get to the line in time. Whoa, wait, hold up a sec there, Chris. You're in a line of homeless people. You might not wanna mention that you have a JOB. Most of the rest of these folks, you see, don't have a job. That is why they are homeless. You came off as a major jerk. Again, not someone worthy of our pity.\nSo who is? Christopher, the young'un, surely is. What's he done to deserve this crappy parenting? His mom basically abandons him with no fight at all, and his dad chooses a tenuous unpaid job over a paycheck. Jaden Smith was critically lauded for his wonderful work here, and he was much more deserving of an Oscar nomination than his old man, who seemed to be praised merely for not playing Will Smith. At least we didn't get yet another rendition of Smith's \"Oh, HELL no!\" exclamations. But the kid was very good, and adorable to boot.\nThe rest of the cast isn't on screen enough to make much of an impression; they're all just window dressing to the relationship between father and son. James Karen is unintentionally amusing as the Great White Father to Smith's broker, needlessly upping the smarm factor. Because, you know, brokerage firms never seem to have enough smarm.\nAll in all, a disappointment unless you just treat it as a low-grade TV movie about someone persevering against long odds, cheerfully ignoring the fact that those odd were made long by that same person. Bear in mind, though, that the movie is merely based on a true story, that many liberties were taken to accentuate the supposed struggles of Chris and Christopher."}

It is, after all, not only a sequel but also the third in a series that prides itself in its clever wit and relevance. I was hoping that Shrek the Third would be close to the first two, but I didn't honestly think it would have enough juice to really slay me in my seat. Er, metaphorically speaking.\nBut Shrek 3 IS fun. It's been three years since the second one, and Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz have lower Q ratings nowadays. Were kids going to swarm the theater for the further adventures of the giant green ogre, or was the series played out? You'd assume the latter, given kids' attention spans and the fact that there's other kid-oriented stuff coming out.\nHad I disliked the movie, I could have called the movie \"Dreck\"; even better, if there'd been some romance between Shrek and his never-seen mom, I could call it \"Oedipus Shrek.\" But geez, I liked it. Now what the heck am I supposed to say about it? How about just \"What the Shrek is going on here?\" Why must they toy with me so? Shrek (Myers) is tapped to become the new king of Far, Far Away when the king (John Cleese) falls ill. But the Shrek with that, says the green blob. There's another heir, he learns, so he, Donkey (Murphy), and Puss (Antonio Banderas) set off to find Arthur, a mopey high school misfit voiced by Justin Timberlake. (Note: I knew Timberlake was in the movie, and I thought he was Arthur's voice, but Artie sounded... well, like a high school kid, maybe even younger.) Meanwhile, Shrek's absence gives good ol' Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) the chance to take over Far, Far Away and RULE! Also aiding Shrek are his pals from other fairy tales, such as the Gingerbread Man, Pinocchio, the Three Little Pigs, the Big Bad Wolf (perpetually in drag and possibly a victim of Stockholm Syndrome, only in reverse), and others. Princess Fiona (Diaz) mobilizes her own galpals (Snow White, Cinderella, Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty) to help stave off Charming's army, which is made up of villains from various tales, such as Captain Hook (Ian McShane), the Wicked Witch, Cyclops, and Rumplestiltskin. It sounds like an excuse to shoehorn as many familiar names into the movie as possible, but some of the characters do seem to justify their existences. Oh, and know who else shows up? Eric Idle, voicing Merlin, who here is a half-crazed former teacher at Artie's school.\nThere's excellent use of song, too; one screaming attack by Snow White (Amy Poehler) is accompanied by the opening yowl of Robert Plant on Led Zeppelin's legendary \"Immigrant Song\"; this is followed by scorching vocals by Anne Wilson of Heart on \"Barracuda.\" Sure, this stuff won't matter to the kidlets, but the adults will get a kick out of cleverly used music from their own childhood.\nHere's why the movie works. None of the leads overdoes things, which is pretty tough to resist when you're doing a kids' movie, I imagine. Myers can be awfully hammy, and so can Murphy. But they're so used to their characters that they didn't go over the top, instead letting the script provide the laughs. Shrek is obstinate and foolish, and Donkey is boisterous and sassy, but they play neatly off each other without making the movie all about them. The first movie was about Shrek meeting Donkey and then Fiona, and the second was about Not Fitting In with Fiona's family. This time around, everyone's saying, \"Hey, we know you know us, so let's concentrate on the story.\" It's a strange and ultimately refreshing approach, and it's what keeps the franchise from going stale. (They better hope so, because the fourth movie will be out in a few years.) All in all, the movie succeeds in every way it wanted to. Shrek had me tittering and guffawing at appropriate times, always a good thing. Nothing ruins a movie like laughing at inopportune times, unless the movie's so bad it's good. Shrek the Third easy reaches the level of comedy and hijinks as it had in the first two movies, not letting up with the funny. There's just no real decline in quality here, folks; this is a movie your kids will heart if they enjoyed the first two."}

Groggily getting to his feet, he sees several other men, some laying prone, one hanging from handcuffs, one tied to a chair. The man has no recollection of who he is, how he got there, who the other men are, nothing. No recollection other than that he just woke up.\nUnknown is a solid, twisty caper/thriller, about a kidnapping that somehow goes wrong; we pick up the action the same time that our protagonist (or is he?) does, so we have to piece things together with him. And, as it turns out, with the others in the warehouse, each of whom has suffered short-term memory loss. Who is \"good,\" who is \"bad,\" and where the heck are they? The man can't get out of the warehouse (there are bars on the windows, and the only door to the outside is electronically controlled), and they have limited means with which to defend themselves. But what if some of them are the ones against whom they should be defending? What then? One thing I liked about this movie, above all else, really, was that whatever did happen, it was neither blindly predictable nor completely implausible. No one trusts anyone, really, but no one completely mistrusts others, either.\nHelping matters is the wonderful, flawless cast, including Jim Caviezel (as the initial waker-upper), Barry Pepper, Greg Kinnear, Joe Pantoliano, Jeremy Sisto, Chris Mulkey, and Peter Stormare. Everyone is dead on; there are no hams this time around. Everything just plain feels right, and what's more, not one character is Good or Bad. Sure, you wake up with Jim Caviezel, and you get the idea he's Good, but he doesn't always act Good. If that makes sense.\nSee, at no point did I feel I comfortably knew what the hey hey was going on. There were feints and double crosses, but not so haphazardly that they lose meaning. We've all seen movies like that, movies that are completely wrapped up in being clever and self-important, so they managed to write themselves into a corner and therefore make no freaking sense.\nUnknown makes sense all along but still surprises, and that's saying something. A lot better than you might imagine it being, based on its title."}

American troops are stationed throughout the city, which is now being repopulated. Among the new/old citizens are two children, the first minors to reenter the city. London is now a dystopia, much as it was in the similarly themed Children of Men, in which mistrust runs high and the government and military seem more antagonistic than beneficial.\nIt's all safe, say the American soldiers. Mission accomplished, and all that. It's safe to come back in. A dedicated military doctor wonders why the newest repatriates include children - \"What if it comes back?\" she wonders. \"Then we kill it,\" she's told. I immediately felt safer.\nOf course, the virus IS back, else there'd be no movie. In a prologue, a small band of survivors holes up in a secluded country cottage. When one answers the door to find an uninfected child, all hell breaks loose, culminating in one man's decision to abandon his wife to the clutches of a rage-infested undead mob.\nThat man, Don (Robert Carlyle), is the father of the two new young arrivals to London, and now he has to explain how their mother died. Being the kind to spare his kids nightmares and to avoid probing questions, he fudges the truth a bit. Next thing you know, the kids are scampering across the Thames to visit their old home, against the express orders of the military, which deems most of London to be very unsafe, rife with disease and pestilence and the like. These are not smart kids.\nYou can see where this is going. The rage virus makes its return, spreading extremely quickly from person to person, and suddenly it's a race against time to get the kids out of London. Now, in all honesty, there's a good reason they have to make it out of the city, other than preserving their own lives, but I won't spoil it here - I point this out merely to show that there is, indeed, a logical reason to hold their lives as more valuable than those of the adults around them.\nBut the trouble with 28 Weeks Later is that it's largely uninvolving, boring crap. The people, except for that Army doctor (Rose Byrne) and an intrepid, ethical soldier (Jeremy Renner), are largely stupid. And I don't mean just that they're all one-dimensional characters, it's that they do dumb things that cause all sorts of mayhem to rain upon them. Things like hugging a woman who may carry the rage disease. Or kissing a woman who may carry the rage disease. Breaking into a security facility to do the latter. That sort of thing. Dumb, dumb, dumb.\nThe second problem with the movie is that there aren't nearly enough zombie attacks. There are some, sure, but they're isolated and feel mighty stagy. Compare the scene in which the doctor and her charges attempt to get out of the city by car with the one in Children of Men in which Clive Owen attempts to escort the first pregnant woman in a generation out of the city. In one, you know the characters will run into a series of obstacles that they'll likely overcome, but in the other, there's no certainty at all - anything could happen.\nThe third problem is that much of the movie's action scenes feel as if they're part of a really bad music video. I'm talking choppy editing with quick, dizzying cuts - this is not a movie for those suffering from vertigo or epilepsy. The action moves so quickly that I literally could not tell what was happening, which can hardly be the point. It reminded me of being in the middle of Space Mountain at Walt Disney World. I saw flashing lights and heard screams, but that was about it. Just poor, poor editing and cinematography.\nIf this was supposed to be a commentary on the dangers of a having the military run a city, whoopee doo - we've seen this kind of junk before. I get it: military bad, citizens good. This movie ups the ante a little bit by actually firebombing London, a sort of Blitz II, but the effect would be the same if I were playing the old Nintendo video game Contra. Because the outbreak's so bad, you see, the soldiers are ordered to waste everyone they see. Everyone's a target. Including, apparently, the audience.\n28 Weeks Later isn't just bad in the sense that most sequels are bad, it's bad in the sense that it manages to replay all clich\u00e9s about dystopian societies, and End Days plagues, and so forth without giving us the goods of zombie attacks, which is what we came for."}
< {"rating": "8", "date": "25 March 2007", "title_id": "tt0424345", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "Sensations; as witty as the first", "content": "Sequels almost never work, particularly if the original movie was an independent, no-frills, cinema verite, low-budget \"experiment,\" like 1994's Clerks was. There was really no reason to think that Clerks 2 - a film Kevin Smith always said would never be made - would be anything more than a narcissistic vanity undertaking, a movie capitalizing on its predecessor's coolness and attitude to make a few extra bucks for its creator.\nAnd yet, somehow, it works. Clerks 2 is both funny and poignant, and considering all the history of the characters, most of whom have appeared in other Smith films, this is an extraordinary accomplishment. Because really, who would have thought, after watching Clerks twelve years ago, that Smith could pull off a touching moment or two without making his characters seem clownish? What we got in 1994 was edgy profanity, wry pop-culture observations, and a minimalist plot. And that worked, because we had low expectations to begin with.\nTwelve years later, with a much bigger budget and shooting in color, how could Smith possibly allay our fears? I expected bombast where there'd been subtlety, Grand Acting where there'd been witticisms. But in updating the story of Dante and Randal, Smith succeeded in making us give a rat's ass about the two nihilists, generic stand ins for every clerk we've ever run across.\nSo it's all these years later, and when Dante comes in to open up the Quik Stop one morning, he finds it ablaze, taking the next-door video store down with it. He and Randal subsequently get jobs at a low-rent McDonald's ripoff called Mooby's (cute - a hamburger joint with a cow motif). A year later, they're still there, but Dante's now engaged to Emma (Jennifer Schwalbach Smith, Kevin's wife) who way back when wouldn't give him the time of day; they're driving down to Florida so Dante can run a car wash owned by her dad. Oh, and her parents are giving them a house, too. Yep, life's finally getting good for the put-upon Dante. He's moving on, which involves leaving Randal for the first time in more than a decade. It also means leaving his boss, Becky (Rosario Dawson), and New Jersey in general.\nWait, what? We can't have Randal and Dante growing as characters - they're supposed to be slightly lovable, identifiable oafs, comfort-food twits. We know 'em. We relate to 'em. We don't want 'em to change. They're supposed to be those people you always see behind the counters, people you don't wanna know. But a funny thing happens - not only do you care about these guys, you're grateful they do grow. And they face their future in wholly believable ways - Dante embraces the American idea of a wife, a nice job, a sunny place to live, that sort of thing, while Randal clings a bit more to what used to be.\nOh, don't despair, though, because the jokes are still there. There's a memorable bit in which Randal strikes down with great vengeance fans of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Plus a KILLER scene in which a man has sex with a donkey (it's not bestiality, it's interspecies erotica!), although we thankfully don't get to see anything. And an attack on so-called racist terms. Plus cameos by Ben Affleck and Jason Lee, but they're not the obtrusive, lookit-me-I'm-a-celeb kind of cameos that make no frickin' sense at all. Affleck's is a quickie; Lee shows up as an Internet millionaire who went to school with Dante and Randal. Sure, there he is, all rich, and there they are, working at a burger joint at age 33.\nThe movie makes more sense than Clerks did - it oughta, since the sequel doesn't have the luxury of seat-of-one's-pants filming. It tracks linearly, and rather than be a series of Incidents of Note, there's much more cohesion and credulity involved. It also helps that everyone does a great job in front of the camera, particularly Jeff Anderson (Randal), Brian O'Halloran (Dante), and Dawson, who also looks ravishing and adorable at the same time (it's the glasses).\nClerks 2 is hilarious, proof that indie auteur Kevin Smith not only hasn't forsaken his roots, he's embraced them wholeheartedly and has enhanced them to keep us all wildly entertained."}

I was ready, because it'd been 16 years since the last one, a movie Stallone himself said was kind of the worst of the bunch. Yeah, kind of. I was ready for Rock to come back against all odds and persevere, beating some rip-snortin' champeen of the world to reclaim his dignity. But although this sixth Rocky film has most of the elements that a winning sports movie will have (underdog story, friends/relatives who don't want him to do it, theme song), the result is flat, coming to life only during the requisite big fight at the end of the movie.\nIt's been a long time since Rocky fought Tommy Morrison. Since then, wife Adrian has died and son Robert is now all grown up working at some highfalutin job. I can't remember what the job was, but it was some kind of white-collar Important job, the better to juxtapose it with Rocky's self-made lifestyle. But Paulie (But Young) is still around and, as it turns out, so is Duke (Tony Burton), who's been Rocky's cut man in all of the films thus far. But wait, with no Adrian there must be some kind of romance, right? Someone who can push Rocky a little, make him really want to succeed? So enter bartender Marie (Geraldine Hughes), who's from Rocky's old Philly neighborhood and has a son of her own. Sure, the son's a teen who looks more like a twentysomething, and he's a tall, gangly dude instead of an adorable waif, but you takes what you can gets.\nAnyway, at this point in his life Rocky's settled down. He has a restaurant, at which he spends a lot of time reminiscing and schmoozing with boxing fans. Trouble is, Rocky lives in the past. Several times we see him visiting Adrian's grave or standing in front of old gyms or bars or other haunts, just trying to soak in some of what used to be. If there was an Olympics for wistfulness, ol' Rock would surely win the gold each time out. He's had much success, and yet here he is, living in the past. Paulie's not of the same mind - he asks Rocky to change the channel, stop living backwards, and any other clich\u00e9 he can come up with.\nMeanwhile, the current champeen of the world is one Mason Dixon, who's something like 35 and 0 with 33 knock outs. The slam on him is that he's not really fighting anyone of any caliber - he's just beating up bums. Sort of the same knock against Mike Tyson back in the day (Tyson even shows up in a ringside cameo), and Dixon gets roundly booed at his bouts. Then a computer simulation is run pitting Dixon against an in-his-prime Balboa. When the results give the edge to Rocky, brother, it is ON! Promoters figure here's their change - people hate Dixon and aren't coming to his fights, so taking on a sentimental fave like Rocky in an exhibition should spike sales.\nSo after some deliberation, Rocky decides to go for it, because that's what Rocky would do. His son, who's had to spend his life in the wide shadow of his father, is wholly against the idea, but naturally he comes around in time. Paulie's against it to, sort of, and even so, he notes he can't really help Rocky train, what with his job and all. But fret not, because that plot complication is handled easily enough, too.\nI'd almost be able to forgive Stallone (who also wrote and directed) for the exponential schmaltz factor if there'd been more actual boxing, but the final battle with Dixon is it. There are no prelim bouts, no fights to get Rocky in shape, nothing. So he basically moves from the gym to the ring for his big fight. In reality, if he pulled that crap in his fifties, he'd be splattered by Dixon within one minute of round one. I won't tell you precisely how it ends, to preserve that air of mystery, but I'll note that the ending adds nothing different to the massive oeuvre of sports movies. Seriously, if you can't figure out how this one'll end, you've probably never watched a movie before.\nAbout the only time the movie's worth caring about is that final fight, though, because it's pretty well done. Fight of the century, even. A lot of traded blows; it's well orchestrated without being unbelievable. I mean, it's not as if Rock is bleeding profusely from the eyes, mouth, nose, and neck and still manages to land a lucky punch to win it all at the last second. That would be stupid. But really, that's the shred of credibility to which this movie clings.\nMost egregiously, we don't get to hear the awesome, iconic theme song in its entirety until the movie's mostly over. On the other hand, a movie without the screeching ineptitude of Talia Shire can't be too awful.\nHopefully, this will bury the ghost of Rocky Balboa for good. It's not a terrible way to go out, but it's by no means a knockout."}

That much I learned from the movie of the same name, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as an amoral smuggler who teams up with a native fisherman (Djimon Hounsou) and an American journalist (Jennifer Connelly). I also learned that huge multinational companies control the diamond market by hoarding all the diamonds. Actually, I knew that part already.\nDenny Archer (DiCaprio) sells guns to rebels in Sierra Leone in exchange for diamonds, which he then turns over to a diamond cartel. Pretty nice gig, really, especially since apparently everyone in Sierra Leone is in on it except for the poor souls who have to mine the stuff. The revolutionaries rampage through villages, killing most of the citizens, including the women and children, and taking the men to work in the diamond mines. Some of the male children are taken to be \"baby killers\" among the rebels. So you see, everyone has a nice job.\nUntil the day that Solomon (Hounsou), mining in a creek for the rebels against his will, comes across a pink stone described as being about the size of a bird's egg. (It's never mentioned which bird, though.) As the rebels are being bombed by the government, Solomon buries the stone. But of course he's been spotted, and the rest of the movie is spent by everyone trying to get his or her hands on it to get out of Africa in one piece.\nOne of those people is Archer. At first you get the impression that he's sort of a summa-cum-Indy, an adventurer who looks like he's out for himself but deep down is a right respectable bastard who'll save a pretty girl and prevent an innocent man from being stabbed. Well, he's sort of that person, in that he'll save the pretty girl (Connelly), as long as he still gets his money. Kind of a low-rent Han Solo, really, only without the cool ride. At any rate, while in jail in Sierra Leone, Archer overhears a captured rebel commander accuse the also-imprisoned Solomon of hiding a big ol' diamond. And that, apparently, is all Archer needs to know, as he gets Solomon bailed out for the sole purpose of getting him to lead Archer to the diamond.\nTo accomplish this, Archer joins forces with Maddy (Connelly), a journalist looking for the real story of the rape of the African continent. She knows the diamond cartels are behind all the mayhem but can't print anything without anyone willing to go on the record with names and dates and other information. Of course, the swaggering Archer might be that person. Might they strike a deal? Oh, even better yet - perhaps they'll fall in love with each other, running through the jungles and plains? Leonardo DiCaprio could wear a four-foot beard and still look about sixteen years old. He can't disguise his youthfulness with a somewhat-acceptable Afrikaans accent (Archer is supposed to be from Rhodesia, aka Zimbabwe). And were we supposed to root for him or against him? In the hands of a skilled actor, ambiguous intentions can lend an air of mystery to a character, but it's a delicate chore; otherwise, you wind up not really caring if the guy's supposed to be good or bad. Such it is with Archer. I got it. He's in it for himself. Okay, I wondered, now what? Give me a reason why I should care if he dies, if all he's after is the diamond, no matter the cost of human life.\nOn the other hand, Hounsou is exceptional as a man who's quiet life has been incontrovertibly rent asunder by the invading rebel forces, which kidnap his son and turn him against his own people, and the government itself, which quarantines all refugees with the idea that it's too tough to tell which refugees are with the rebels and which are not. Having lost nearly everything save his own dignity, Solomon does not break, but bends when he must. His urgent need is to reunite with his family and restore order to their lives. Nothing else matters; he sees his diamond as a way out of everything.\nCompleting the troika is Connelly, who offers a somewhat distaff performance as the naive, unlikeable journo Maddy. Why would Maddy feel compelled to help Archer? Oh, that's right, he's Leonardo DiCaprio. The blunt sexual tension gets to be a bit too much at times; try to avoid screaming \"oh, just get on with it, already!\" at the screen. Connelly's done much better work than here, of course. It's just that she seems so listless, almost bored at times by the proceedings, like she can't quite believe she's in this junky, pseudoaction movie.\nWe're supposed to take away from this movie the central message that Diamonds Are Bad, at least if people died in order for them to make it to us. As soon as the movie came out, various diamond companies announced they were upstanding companies who'd never, ever do anything like this. I don't know what I should believe, because I've always sort of thought that buying shiny rocks was a dumb thing to do, anyway. But overall, the impression one gets is that this is just another dumb Hollywood message/action movie. A lot of the time, the scenes are basically people running from one explosion to another; luckily, the fine acting of Hounsou allows the audience to track what's going on rather effectively. And of course, in the end Things Are Solved, as I'm sure they are in real life."}

This makes no sense, of course, since she's supposedly the Good Guy, but it's explained away by the unassailable reasoning that all ex-girlfriends are certifiable.\nIn fact, the movie's conundrum is that because Thurman's G-Girl/Jenny Johnson is wacko, should we be rooting for her or against her? And when Wilson's Matt falls for a cute coworker (Anna Faris) instead, are we supposed to be on her side, or Jenny's? The women in the audience, of course, are probably supposed to think Jenny's in the right, because she's been wronged. If I'd seen this in the theater, I'd probably hear endless \"You go girls.\" This is what passes for self-actualization, the empowerment of women by way of destroying men. Watching the movie, you know full well that somehow, even with all the violence and insanity perpetuated by Jenny, she'll wind up on the good side of things.\nMeanwhile, the men are all nodding their heads in sympathy. \"I hear ya, man,\" as they watch Matt put up with Jenny's crap. And then wincing as she zaps him with heat vision. Man, that's gotta hurt.\nWilson is underwhelming in the lead; it's almost as if he's playing the role of the sincere best friend instead of the charming (if ordinary) Everyman. He doesn't have the effortless charisma of his older brother Owen, and that strong personality is missing. Then again, Thurman's acting style is to underplay most roles, even tough ones like Beatrice in Kill Bill. That would be fine here if her role wasn't that of a psychotic, neurotic superhero; instead of giving the character some depth or nuance, Thurman's performance felt superficial and artificial, as if it were spit out of the RoboActor 4000.\nAdding to the dull leads were Rainn Wilson as Best Bud Vaughn, an incorrigible womanizer, and Faris as Hannah, Matt's actual Tru Luv 4 Evah. Wilson's okay, although poor writing makes his character more annoying than you'd think he'd be. Faris is blah. She's always blah, though, so I wasn't disappointed. She does look good, though, so there's that.\nGetting a special dishonorable mention is the terrible, constipated performance by Wanda Sykes. With her nails-on-a-chalkboard voice combined with a cranky, bitchy attitude, Sykes does grievous harm to the movie. Take her useless character out of the equation (she plays Matt's boss, who sees sexual harassment everywhere, so you know right away she's annoying as can be), and you could bump this rating up a half star.\nEven the effects were kind of lame. So G-Girl can fly. And of course, there's the obligatory bring-the-not-flying-dude-up-above-the-city thing. But so what? Considering how many superhero movies there have been lately - and this was released right after Superman Returns - the action scenes aren't anything you haven't seen before. Add to that the fact that G-Girl (the reason for this moniker is never explained) indiscriminately wrecks cars and buildings while trying to avenge the breakup, thus putting innocent people in constant mortal peril, and you get a convoluted mishmash of shady, ambiguous motivations.\nI think that if about 20 minutes had been chopped out of this Ivan Reitman film, it might have been palatable. There's too much standard romantic-comedy crap in there. Of COURSE Jenny has to screw up Matt's Big Day at work, with his Big Presentation in front of the new Chinese clients. I mean, duh. And of course, at the denouement, every freaking secondary character except Sykes' shows up, some for no particular reason at all. It's as if there were several writers, each working in his or her own trailer on separate planets, and the results were fed into the Script Generator O' Awesomeness, and this is what we get. Same for the editing, come to think of it.\nBah. Worst part of it all is that Matt doesn't break up with Jenny until the movie's half over! I mean, it's in the title! Look! That'd be like having a movie called Superman Returns, only he doesn't come back until Metropolis has already had its ass kicked and the plane's crashed, and General Zod rules the world. When a movie can't even deliver effectively on its own title, you know you're in for a world of hurtin'."}

Bet you didn't know that, did you? Apparently magicians analyze and study their craft endlessly, trying to improve, compete, excel, and dominate. The Prestige is about two lifelong competing magicians in 1900s London who are constantly trying to discover each other's secrets. Eventually, as they top each other, there's death, perhaps murder, placing everyone they know in mortal danger.\nRobert Angier (Hugh Jackman) is the showman, the magician with a flair for the dramatic. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is the moody technician with the creativity and intelligence to pull off the most remarkable stunts. They would seem to be fine complements for each other, but each is so set on beating the other that all pretense of camaraderie is abandoned.\nWhat follows, of course, is a couple hours of twists and turns, with so and so turning out to not be what he or she was purported to be. One of Angier's tricks goes horribly awry, and Borden is blamed for the result and is jailed. Is he guilty? How did he accomplish it? Linking the two masters is the aged Cutter (Michael Caine), who's been training them both since they were just starting out. A veteran of the gritty, no-holds-barred magic world, Cutter Knows Things. With a glint in his eye and a crusty grin, he reminded me more of Long John Silver, except without the eye path or the walking stick. Nothing like a crusty ol' sage to keep everyone in check, right? The heart of the animosity between Angier and Borden is that it's thought that Borden somehow was responsible for the death of Angier's wife during their act. Then Borden goes on to fame and fortune while Angier has nothing. Even Borden's tricks kick the ass of Angier's tricks, so much so that the latter journeys to, of all places, Boulder, Colorado in the United States to seek out Nicholas Tesla (well played by David Bowie), who'd built a funky device for Borden to use in his own act. All that's missing is Angier shouting, \"Vengeance will be mine!\" Enter Olivia (Scarlett Johansson), a trollop/assistant who joins Angier's act. They fall in love, surprisingly. (That sentence brought to you by the word \"sarcasm.\") Meanwhile, Borden falls in love with HIS assistant and knocks her up. So it's sort of like real life.\nPerhaps where the movie really lost me is in its science - one must suspend quite a bit of disbelief in order for key parts of the film to be acceptable. That's one of the risks of a story about magic; modern audiences know a lot more about science than did those at the turn of the last century, so there'd be much more skepticism. If Angier's trick were shown today, people would have myriad guesses as to what really happened, whereas in the 1900s it was all magic and wonder and crap like that. Still and all, the way in which Angier accomplishes his trick seems like a shaggy dog - it's in the story merely to move the plot along.\nI like movies with twists and turns, but when there are so many of them I no longer know what's right and what's wrong, I kind of lost interest in the movie. I hate not knowing which way is up, because when the credibility of each character - and, by extension, their own reality - is called into question, then the viewer has nothing to go by, and truly Anything can happen. Which makes me wonder what the point really is.\nOn the plus side, you have the subtext of Batman (Bale) versus Wolverine (Jackman). Even Alfred from Batman is there (Caine). And both actors are pretty good, but the movie plods along in places. I've never really liked Bale, though, who has a giant head.\nSee The Illusionist instead, a movie covering some of the same ground but more effectively and believably, with scarce, credible turns."}

Sadly, though, it's all unintentional humor. The movie manages to pack in every comic book and action movie clich\u00e9 imaginable, laughable casting, an illogical script, wooden acting, and jarring direction for straight-faced amusement.\nJohnny Blaze is a 17-year-old tyro who works in a circus as part of a daredevil motorcycle act with his father. When he learns his dad's got cancer, Johnny makes a literal deal with the Devil (played by a cardboard cutout of Peter Fonda) to save his dad's life. That lasts about one day, because the next evening Johnny's dad dies during a performance. \"Nooooooooooooo!\" shouts Johnny. Which is kind of what you'll be yelling when you watch the movie.\nJohnny has a girl, too, Roxanne. The night before the fateful performance, she tells him she's moving away - her dad, skeptical about Johnny's ability to stay alive in such a dangerous line of work, is sending her to live with her mother. Roxanne informs Johnny of this the very moment he's done carving an elaborate \"Johnny + Roxanne Forever\" mark into a huge, old tree. Apparently she didn't want to ruin his concentration before dropping the bombshell. The two decide to run away together anyway, but then Johnny's pop dies, and Johnny runs off on his own to become the World's Awesomest Motorcycle Dude.\nMeanwhile! Elemental angels in league with the Devil's son, Blackheart, are trying to get a contract giving them control over the souls of some long-dead town. With these souls, Blackheart can rule the world, or something. (It's unclear how all of the souls of one tiny town in the middle of nowhere would give anyone the power to rule anything bigger than a hamburger stand.) And, it seems, when Johnny made his deal with the Devil he became the Ghost Rider, responsible for transporting the contracts of souls to the Devil; Blackheart wants to intercept the contract so he can usurp power from his dad.\nFast forward one year later. Yes, one year. Johnny has changed from being 17 to being... Nicolas Cage. Cage is 43 years old. This makes no sense. Oh, and of course he runs into old flame Roxanne, too, now played by Eva Mendes. Or, more accurately, played by Eva Mendes' chest, which is prominently on display whenever possible. Mendes is 32 years old. She is, ostensibly, playing an 18 year old. Even more amusingly, Roxanne is now a television reporter. At 18, it's more likely she'd be assistant gopher to the producer. Ever the professional, even when on the air Roxanne wears low-cut tops, the better to distract the viewer from her inane questions.\nOne gets the impression that Cage signed on to this role merely because he sports a Ghost Rider tattoo, which, ironically, had to be covered up for the movie. It's kind of as if Jerry Seinfeld were tapped to play Superman. You get all of Cage's mannerisms - the tics, the hangdog expression, the mouth-agape gaze, the laconic attitude. Not really what you expect from a comic-book hero. Mendes is fun to look at, but her delivery is paradoxically flat. Rounding out the cast are a couple of old timers - Sam Elliot plays Caretaker, a wily old coot as only Sam Elliot could play him. Elliot's a fantastic actor, and he's a much better fit for his role here than anyone else in this sludgy claptrap, but he can't save the movie. He's not even on screen until around the halfway point of the movie. Peter Fonda, looking weathered and sort of beaten-down, is The Devil; he's sort of aloof and unconvincing. Oh yeah, and Wes Bentley, who once was in American Beauty, is Blackheart, sans Joan Jett. Geez, they could have gotten any gothy-looking nitwit to play this role, it was so over-the-top. Bentley does not make a good villain.\nLet's be clear here. This isn't supposed to be a funny movie. It's a straightfaced, comic-book tale of a haunted young man. And yet the movie's so ineptly presented, one can't help but laugh. Questions abound: Why does Ghost Rider not even show up until a good way into the movie? Why are we told Johnny's jumping 300 feet (a football field) when the distance is longer than that (360 feet)? Why, when Johnny asks the Devil if he's the one responsible for keeping Johnny alive through all his death-defying feats, does the Devil say, \"No, that was all you, Johnny\"? (Was it? If you're the Devil and you NEED this guy to be your Ghost Rider, and your guy is in a line of work in which he's constantly in harm's way, wouldn't you help him so he doesn't, you know, die?) When Johnny stops his cycle on a busy freeway so he can chat with Roxanne, blocking traffic, how come no one drives around his bike and her van? There are two lanes. Why, if Blackheart's a supernatural (and presumably immortal) being, does Caretaker toss Johnny a kick-ass shotgun with which to attack Blackheart? Why is the church where Caretaker lives and works sacred, hallowed ground that Blackheart cannot trod upon, but other churches - including the one in the tiny, middle-of-nowhere village - are not? Why, when Ghost Rider races through the city one night, inadvertently causing destruction, does exactly one car flip up and smash into a window, despite there being dozens of other vehicles around it? How come Ghost Rider can be hurt if you stab him in the shoulder blade, but you can't wound him by shooting him? (Some of these questions may have actual answers, but I didn't get them from the movie.)\nSo the movie's pretty much useless, and in a week or so we'll have forgotten it ever existed. It's poorly acted, directed, and written and offers little in the way of solid entertainment - unless, of course, you're looking for some unintentional laughs."}

The movie is oftentimes difficult to watch, with ultrarealistic cinematography and gutsy, honest performances from its entire cast, particularly Oscar-nominated actresses Adriana Barraza (Amelia) and Rinko Kikuchi (Chieko).\nTold nonlinearly, the movie describes the travails of a troubled married couple with a tour group in Morocco, played by Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Something in their past has driven them apart, and to help deal with the problem they have taken a trip together. Meanwhile, the sons of a shepherd fight over who's the better shot with their new rifle and fire a blast at the couple's tour bus, critically wounding Susan (Blanchett).\nRichard (Pitt) calls home in San Diego to notify the nanny of their children, Amelia; Amelia is in a bit of a bind, because she expected the parents home so she could attend the wedding of her son in Mexico. With Richard and Susan not returning soon, and with no one else available to watch the children, she takes them with her to the wedding.\nIn Japan, a deaf-mute Japanese girl acts out in reaction to her mother's suicide, which she discovered; the virginal Chieko becomes a huge sexual flirt, even removing her panties in a crowded restaurant to flash older boys. Chieko craves human contact but feels that the world's even more shut off to her now than ever before, and she sullenly shuns even her father's attentions.\nIt should go without saying that this film really isn't for everyone. It's gut-wrenchingly tough to watch at times, especially when Susan's wound is being treated. You can readily imagine how it'd be if you, an unworldly American, were suddenly in dire need of expert medical attention in a part of the world that wasn't really famed for it. That's enough to strike terror in me already, and I haven't even mentioned how Richard and Susan are awaiting help to arrive in a small, impoverished village with no running water or electricity - and only one person who can speak English to them.\nHow exactly these stories are commingled becomes evident as the movie progresses, but it's not all elegantly laid out for the viewer to immediately grasp; this is accomplished in part by the nonlinear storytelling. We see a scene near the end of the movie that is a mirror image of one from the beginning, except told from a different character's perspective. That's a tribute to the wonderful camera-work and editing by, respectively, Rodrigo Prieto and the team of Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrone.\nBarraza turns in a powerful, heart-breaking performance; at one point, she's stranded in the middle of the Sonoran desert with her two young charges clad in her dress from the wedding. Dazed by the blistering heat, Amelia cannot gain her bearings in the blazing heat, and she despairs. Then she makes a critical decision with devastating consequences.\nKikuchi is absolutely mesmerizing as the silent Chieko. Without uttering one word, she's able to convey a vast array of emotions, from loneliness to hostility to love to lust to affection. She's alternately serene and violent, in charge of and captured by her impediment. Chieko resents her father, her volleyball teammates, and most of all every so-called normal person who looks at deaf-mutes as monsters, creatures to be scorned and taken advantage of. Like Barraza, Kikuchi's role called for a difficult sacrifice: plenty of nudity.\nBabel is a spellbinding, multifaceted story with towering, passionate performances by all of the leads. It's full of moxie and stark realism, and despite some minor plot implausibilities, it's a true feather in the cap for Inarritu."}

Arctor has infiltrated a gang of low-level drug pushers/smugglers, including Donna Hawthorne (Winona Ryder), Charles Freck (Rory Cochrane), James Barris (Robert Downey, Jr.), and Ernie Luckman (Woody Harrelson), hoping to find out who their supplier is. At the same time, though, Arctor is falling under the deep spell of Substance D himself and is beginning to hallucinate.\nSo Bob's hooked, but he doesn't want anyone at work to know (it might cost him his job). And his boss at work is leaning on Bob to get more information; the boss knows Bob's in the gang, but he doesn't know which of the gang is Bob. Confused? Well, see, here's a nifty little quirk - every undercover agent wears an intelligent suit and mask that is constantly changing: the face, the body, the clothes, everything. Plus, the voice that comes out of the mask is altered, so no one can tell who's inside. This goes for Bob's boss, too. Essentially, the cops know that Bob, known as Officer Fred to his station, is one of the four members of the gang, but they don't know which one, and they don't care.\nBut while Bob's trying to get the goods on the gang, another of their number snitches - Barris. According to Barris, Bob's the leader of the pack, the man in charge, the one responsible for pushing all of the dope. Of course, Barris has no idea that Bob is right there in the room when Barris makes this accusation to Bob's boss. So now Bob's job becomes one of survival - he can't let the police know how deep he is, because he could be implicated much worse than anyone else.\nI know, I know, this sounds pretty complicated and convoluted, but bear with me - my explaining skills aren't as swift as those of screenwriter (and director) Richard Linklater and author Phillip K. Dick, on whose story this movie's based. The movie's about losing one's identity - who is Bob? Is he Bob, or is he Fred? Is he the owner of the drug, or the ownee? And, he has to wonder, is anyone else he knows actually as they seem, or are Ernie and Charles also in with the police? Is Bob being set up? Substance D is bad. Megabad. Anyone here ever see the movie Naked Lunch? In it, Peter Weller hallucinates he's talking to giant cockroaches. That's one of the many effects of long-term Substance D use. Other side effects include schizophrenia and paranoia; essentially, the two hemispheres of Bob's brain are competing for dominance, and it's messing him up just a teensy bit. People who get to this stage of Substance D use usually wind up in rehab at a place called New Path, which apparently has been very effective in curing what ails ya.\nAside from the gripping plot - and it is gripping, just complex enough to maintain your interest without boring the hell out of you - the main draw here is the filming technique that Linklater uses, rotoscoping. The actors were first filmed performing their scenes; then, the scenes were drawn over and computerized. The result is an eerie, lifelike effect; it's like watching an extremely well animated film in which every detail is nuanced, every character fully articulated. Rather than being a distraction or a novelty, though, the technique enhances the movie greatly, taking a fairly straightforward plot and ramping it up chillingly. (As an aside, I think it's the kind of effect Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez wish they'd achieved with Sin City, which feels laughable next to this masterpiece.) So all in all, this is a wonderful film. Fascinating to watch, riveting, the whole nine yards. There's plenty of suspense and just enough unanswered questions to leave you satisfied in the end. Reeves is perfect for the role, and Ryder's never looked more beautiful. Heck, even Harrelson was outstanding. This is a real treat."}

Maggie Gyllenhaal gives an effective, appealing performance and gets somewhat naked. 2. The movie manages to just avoid happily-ever-after clich\u00e9s. 3. There are subtle hints to the backstory rather than obvious manipulations.\nBut it's not really enough. There are plenty of scenes in the movie that just seem to lag a bit as if something might poke through the ennui and stir things up, but not really. So color this one as a half-step above the usual woman-making-it-right-when-she's-done-so-wrong movie. But only a half-step.\nSherry Swanson (Gyllenhaal) is out of prison after doing a stretch for robbery and drugs and basic slutty, scummy behavior. We first see her arrive at the halfway house at which she's to spend the rest of her sentence. Ah, she's finally out, and she's going to do the right thing this time, you'll see! You can almost see her eyes twinkle. \nSherry has a daughter she hasn't seen since she was in stir, named Alexis. Alexis has been cared for lo these many years by Sherry brother Bob and his wife Lynnette. Bob picks Sherry up at the halfway house and brings her to his house for the reunion, and of course Alexis is excited to see a new person who smothers her in attention. But it's not long before young Alexis is calling her \"Sherry\" instead of \"Mommy,\" which Sherry takes as a sign that Bob and Lynnette are trying to take her baby away from her. (As if they needed to try; Sherry's not gonna get custody anytime soon.)\nSherry also tangles with her parole officer, played with some gusto by Giancarlo Esposito, who isn't going to cut her much slack. Which is just as well, because pretty much every other guy in the movie somehow succumbs to Sherry's charms and does what she wants. It's when she doesn't get her way that things go all pissy. See, Sherry's not really what you'd call proactive; she expects things to work out for her without her doing any of the work. So, to speed things along, she takes certain immoral shortcuts. In fact, after watching the first thirty minutes or so, I thought I'd put in a porno by mistake. I mean, I thought I'd been sent the wrong disk by Netflix. Yeah, that. Anyway, the pattern seemed to be: 1) Decide to do something. 2) Approach male who could facilitate that. 3) Have sex with male. 4) Repeat if necessary.\nSo far, so good - Sherry isn't a completely new person when she emerges from the clink, and that at least feels realistic, because how often are ex-cons completely rehabilitated and never do anything wrong, ever again? Probably not very many. Forget recidivism, because that includes only those who got caught. At any rate, Sherry's still a slut. And prone to profanity, as she doesn't mind dropping f-bombs in front of her kid, who she's trying to win over.\nThen you have the eventual relapse, and visits to a support group, and new friends. But this isn't a hugs-and-kisses kind of movie - even though Sherry holds hands with everyone in the group and pledges to be free of her demons, we all know she might never, and we question her commitment to same. That's fine, because in reality it's an extremely difficult undertaking, and to me if she'd overcome everything too easily, all similarity to reality would be out the door. But director Laurie Collyer played it straight, giving the film a good boost of authenticity.\nMovies like this usually aren't my bag at all. If I wanted to see a movie about a bad girl making her way in the world, I'd turn on Lifetime. Oh, sure, I know there's an audience for strong, independent women, but clearly I'm not it. So I didn't expect this to be all that wonderful; I'd just heard that Gyllenhaal was good in it. And I like her. And she was. Plus, she got naked! So, for those positives, it's not too bad of a movie. A bit grim in spots, and it's very gritty - drug use, sex, language all make appearances. Still, it IS a well-made film about a strong, independent woman who doesn't have all of the answers."}

Remember when Toy Story came out, and we were all \"Woo! Awesome animation! It's so... so lifelike!\" And then with each passing year, we were more \"Eh, looks nice. It'll keep the kids entertained.\" The resultant ennui with 'toon films has forced animation studios to be even more innovative.\nSo for Monster House, images of the actors providing the characters' voices were captured using 3D motion techniques; then the animated form of the characters was added as a top layer, producing a level of clarity and articulation that approaches that found in live-action films. It's really pretty neat, but there's a caveat: Because of the enhanced realism, the movie can be frightening to young children. When Wile E. Coyote attempts to drop an anvil on the Roadrunner, no one's terrified that a bird's gonna be splattered all over the place, because everything looks.. well, cartoony. Unrealistic. Taking place in someone's vivid imagination. But take that terror and multiply it by two or three and then make the whole shebang as realistic looking as possible, and your fright factor is exponential. (Sorry, didn't mean to involve math there.) D.J. (Mitchel Musso) is a loner/nerd whose parents Just Don't Understand. He also keeps tabs on the house across the street, the kind of house every neighborhood seems to have - a spooky-looking old manse with a spotty history buoyed by decades of gossip and innuendo. The house's sole occupant is Mr. Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi), your standard \"Hey you kids, get offa my lawn!\" mean old man. (In the opening sequence, he grabs a little girl's tricycle and destroys it.) Something's fishy about Old Man Nebbercracker and his house, but D.J. can't convince his hands-off parents (Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara); they in turn hand him off to a virulently nasty babysitter named Zee (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who doesn't give a rat's ass about D.J. or his babblings about mean old men, she just wants to hang out with her boyfriend Bones (Jason Lee) and smooch.\nBut D.J. is not without backup. His best pal is Chowder (Sam Lerner), a portly, crewcutted lad who acts about forty times faster than he thinks, which makes for high comedy. They've been buds for a long while, so when an entrepreneurial Girl Scout clone shows up to sell candy, they both compete for her affection. Of course, this subtle story thread takes a back seat to the ominous house across the street, and D.J. and Chowder team up with their new pal Jenny (Spencer Locke) to solve the mystery. But is this an ordinary tale of a crotchety old man who hates kids? Or is there something more sinister at play? The title of the movie might provide a subtle hint.\nThe characterizations are wonderful, with the troika of Lerner, Musso, and Locke perfectly essaying the dynamics of childhood interactions: the two best buddies, the interloper, the first love. You honestly believe these are real kids acting out real situations and facing their fears of the unknown, older people, even puberty. Such natural-seeming acting isn't simple for anyone, especially novice actors, even if they're providing only a voice. Gyllenhaal is sweetly menacing, and I wish I'd seen/heard more of O'Hara and Willard. Kathleen Turner, who provided the voice of Jessica Rabbit once upon a time for producer Robert Zemeckis, shows up as the voice of the titular house, and although we don't hear a heck of a lot of her, what we hear is choice.\nAs I mentioned before, one issue with the movie is that the violence can get pretty intense at times. I mean, the house is ALIVE and eats people and pets and toys. There's no blood or dismemberment, certainly, but kids are in constant peril, and it all feels so much more real than your typical cartoon that for really young tots this might be a little too nerve wracking. I actually looked at the screen at one point and said, \"This movie is messed up!\" the hair-raising, children-in-harm's-way would make for a decent thriller/horror movie if it were live action. Hey, I'm not saying I was scared, mind you! I'm just looking out for the kids. Yeah, the kids.\nAnyway, Monster House is loads of fun. It's genuine scares and thrills combined with a real ear for how kids interact with each other. A winner."}

Years later, Eisenheim (Edward Norton) has risen to be the most popular - and mysterious - illusionist in Vienna, and Sophie (Jessica Biel) is betrothed to Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), a tyrant-in-training who has designs on his father's throne as Emperor.\nLeopold grows increasingly uneasy about Eisenheim, whose relationship to Sophie is unknown to the Crown Prince, believing that the magician is committing fraud or claiming to possess supernatural powers. What truly irks the prince, though, is that Eisenheim manages to upstage him at the Prince's own castle with a magical display that enchants his audience of the social elite. And so Leopold orders Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to investigate the illusionist closely to determine his secrets.\nEisenheim performs some truly astounding tricks, including growing an orange tree before the unbelieving eyes of the audience and transporting a handkerchief from a closed box in the audience to the claws of small doves on the stage. But after a truly unfortunate turn of events, his show becomes quite minimalist in scope: The Illusionist merely sits on the stage and conjures - yes, conjures - speaking, reacting ghosts to wow and astound the audience, while Eisenheim mopes about distractedly. What has happened to put him in this state cannot be explained here, unfortunately. But when Eisenheim's performances go a little too far for the Crown Prince's liking, Leopold orders Uhl to arrest the magician.\nBut this is no mere telling of unrequited love followed by the mysteries of a magician. The placid Eisenheim desperately misses his long-lost love, and when he sees her in the company of the overbearing boor Prince Leopold, he uses all of the magic at his disposal to free the beautiful Sophie from the Crown Prince. How this is ultimately accomplished constitutes the great twist in The Illusionist.\nNorton is simply - to use a pun shamefully - spellbinding as Eisenheim, a man who uses a paucity of words, every motion calculated well in advance, every emotion kept in check, doled out in spring-loaded moments of unbridled passion. Eisenstein, in the capable hands of Norton, is a romantic, a cipher, an unknowable hero. It's a shame the movie was released during a year in which many other wonderful performances evolved on the screen, because Norton - twice nominated for Academy awards - turns in a performance that rivals those of his more-lauded roles.\nSurprisingly, Biel is pretty good - and, of course, devastatingly sexy - as the aristocrat trapped in a loveless marriage who finally finds someone worth living for and with. Of course, there's not much to be surprised about, since I haven't seen her in much, just Ulee's Gold, when she was a kid, and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. Still, she's hot, and it's rare that a gorgeous actress can actually show emotional range. It's a real treat, too, to watch Giamatti, who's well cast as the intrepid inspector, a role with more than a passing acquaintance with Claude Rains' Captain Renault of Casablanca, a man not above petty bribery and graft but with his own system of morals.\nA lush, dark mystery, The Illusionist relies heavily on the splendid performances of its three youthful leads to weave wonderful threads of mystery, romance, and intrigue."}

And the way that the apparently loose strand was tied up (although not too neatly) quickly restored my faith in the film.\nThe stentorial Dame Judi Dench plays Barbara Covett, a self-described battle-axe of a teacher at a London high school, who befriends the school's new art teacher, Sheba Hart (Cate Blanchett), a willowy tree branch of a woman who appears to be much more style than substance. During an altercation between students, Barbara saves Sheba with some quick thinking and impromptu discipline, and the two become fast friends. Both teachers are outsiders among their coworkers: Barbara the tough-minded contrarian and Sheba the tall, almost flighty blonde, and soon they're enjoying lunches together and lunches and drinks after work. You know, good bonding.\nUntil, of course, Barbara learns that Sheba's been having an affair with one of her underage students. But rather than turn Sheba in to the school authorities, Barbara instead decides to use the information to her advantage, eliciting a promise from Sheba to call off the affair immediately and return (metaphorically) to the loving arms of her older husband, Richard (Bill Nighy, lately seen with appendages on his face in the Pirates of the Caribbean movie), and her two young children. Barbara's intentions seem pure - why involve the school and police when the two friends can work it out on their own? After all, that's what friends are for.\nBut then Stuff Happens, the insane behavior to which I alluded in my first paragraph. And that causes a sea change in the way the friends view each other. Who is doing the right thing for whom, exactly? Is Barbara betraying Sheba's confidence? Is Sheba half as bad as we've seen her made out to be? And a chain of events is set into motion that destroys people's lives but falls just short of being a bona fide tragedy, since no one has the good grace to die of shame.\nDench is beyond superb. I'm so used to seeing her in regal, all-knowing roles that it's refreshing to see her as a more vulnerable - and darker - character, allowing her to really plumb its depths. Barbara, who narrates, can be a cold, scheming bitch with a real axe to grind but also the kindest, empathic woman in the room. Well, for the right people, the kind of people she wants to spend the rest of her life with, perhaps. And Blanchett has never looked better, lighting up the screen with her bewitching, haunting eyes; it's easy to see why her students think Sheba's so wonderful. Heck, even the male teachers want to knock boots with Mrs. Hart.\nAs the movie races to its denouement, one's never sure for whom one should be rooting, which to my mind is a hallmark of well-made thrillers. There aren't really any winners in this one, just shattered dreams and lost opportunities. Huge kudos to the pitch-perfect cast and the artful direction of Richard Eyre, who directed Dench in Iris (2000)."}

Had a couple hundred thousand miles on it and was a tough drive if one wasn't used to manual transmissions, but it looked cool in a somewhat-ironic way and was, of course, a viable means of conveyance. You'll find almost the same exact VW in Little Miss Sunshine, with the same wacky orange exterior and weird off-beige interior, but what sets this one apart from mine is that the Hoover family car has such fun problems as a disappearing clutch, a side door that doesn't close correctly, and a horn that doesn't quite stop honking. And yet somehow the vehicle manages to hold itself together long enough to travel from Arizona to California and back for the much-heralded Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant for young girls.\nOne of the two magnificent aspects of the movie is that the family's comprised of unlikeable people, that is, normal people to whom you yourself might be related. There's no hero, exactly (save Olive, the kidlet), because each of the members has some kind of negative vibe going on, whether it's bankruptcy, smoking, muteness, drug use, or suicide. Oh, sure, they're a regular Manson Family there, except for the killing bit. Anyway, the family has to shepherd young Olive to the pageant one weekend because she learns at the last minute that she's become a contestant (she finished fourth in an earlier pageant, but third place got sick) and her usual ride for these pageants is unavailable. So the entire family piles into the microbus (without shovels and rakes and implements of destruction - see if you get that reference), owing to a whole bunch of reasons. Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is going, because he's responsible for teaching Olive the number she'll do for the talent portion of the show. Dad Richard (Greg Kinnear) is going because he alone can drive the VW; mom Sheryl (Toni Collette) is going because, well, she wants to. And suicidal uncle Frank (Steve Carell) can't be left alone, but brother Dwayne (Paul Dano) is perhaps a little young to stay home aloneish.\nIf this were a typical family movie, you'd expect the dysfunctional clan to grow over the course of their journey, to learn to love each other despite all flaws, to bond and harmonize soulfully behind the dreamy Olive. No way that happens here; these people clearly don't like each other, except Olive, who's immune (and/or oblivious) to the negative vibes surrounding her family.\nA great deal of the entertainment value of Little Miss Sunshine are the wacky adventures that the group gets into during the ride to Redondo Beach, and it's not just red herrings that filmmakers toss in to distract you from a crappy plot - you can well imagine these things happening to anyone, such as the aforementioned clutch problem. So the movie automatically feels real to you, not like you're just watching a bunch of actors going through the motions. And then things REALLY pick up once they get to the pageant.\nLike I said, everyone's sort of dislikable. Grandpa is a drug-using, cranky ol' coot who's prone to blunt, profanity-laced tirades. Which makes him several kinds of awesome right there. His son Richard is a controlling goof who completely subscribes to the nine-steps-to-success program that he hawks for a living (\"Don't be a loser!\"). Cheryl, who somehow holds the family together, chain smokes and seems the very portrait of crass white trash, while her brother Frank is a gay near-suicide who's been released into his sister's care. Oh, and then there's Dwayne, who's intentionally mute. Nope, not saying a word, no way, not until he enters the Air Force Academy; it's some sort of discipline exercise.\nAnd at the center of all this weirdness is little, slightly pudgy Olive, played by the wonderful Abagail Breslin, perhaps best known for playing one of Mel Gibson's strange kids in Signs. Olive is adorable and real, in contrast to other contestants, who are perhaps adorable but quite artificial. Anyway, Olive seems ignorant of the wacky behavior of her relations except in the most abstract terms, as one might expect from an eight-year-old (meaning she's not stricken by that Hollywood disease of precociousness). Breslin's a real treat, and she was rewarded for her excellent performance with an Oscar nomination.\nI mentioned two entertaining aspects of the movie; the other is that the denouement isn't a perfect happy ending. Add that to the realistic - often hysterical, mind you - situations in which the family finds itself, while seemingly not behaving out of character, and you have a gloriously funny film."}

For some reason, all of the women on Earth have gone infertile. Consequently, everyone's in a state of panic, and anarchy has more or less broken out in the now-dystopian England. Illegal immigrants are swept up and deported, if they're lucky - many are instead shot down in cold blood. Things look mighty grim as the populace slowly realizes that its own extinction is imminent unless a baby can be born.\nA former activist, Theo (Clive Owen), is asked by a former flame, Julian (Julianne Moore) to acquire transit papers - shades of Casablanca - for a young woman who's trying to get to The Human Project, a band of rebels well outside of London. The woman, named Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey), is pregnant - the first pregnancy in the world in 18 years. However, the rebels don't want Kee to fall into the hands of the oppressive regime, because they're afraid Kee might be \"disappeared.\" So Theo agrees to attempt to transport Kee to a safe ocean passage to The Human Project, in order to save the human race.\nChildren of Men is an exhilarating story that simply never lets up, following Kee's journey from when she meets Theo (and is accompanied by several helpers of varying degrees of morality) through to the bittersweet, tragic ending. It's not giving anything away to note that bad things happen, and not all who support Kee's cause will live to see the end of her tale.\nThe London in Children of Men is apparently a fair representation of the Baghdad of the real world, with disparate factions at war with each other to assume control in a largely lawless (outside of walled areas) society. People are shot without warning and with little provocation, all in the name of protecting the \"good\" people. Theo, as a bureaucrat, is largely unaffected by the chaos other than minor inconveniences, but when he's accosted by Julian's cohorts (the ol' throw a sack over his head and toss him in a van bit) and sees Julian for the first time in many years, he throws his hat into the ring as well, I think partly for old times' sake (he used to protest with Julian).\nThe unrelenting violence in the movie is often jarring, unsettling the viewer and setting one's teeth on edge. Political atmosphere aside, one desperately hopes Kee is able to succeed in her quest, partly because of the whole saving-mankind bit but also because Kee herself - and those immediately around her - is so believable and likable. She's no shrinking violet, but she's also not of the same stripe as the rebels (gritty and raging against the machine); she simply wants to have her baby safely.\nThe entire cast is dazzling, although the overall success of the film really hinges on the growing relationship between Theo and Kee; Ashitey more than carries her weight in a tough, complex film, and Owen turns in his usual solid work. Moore is ravishing in the few scenes in which she appears, eyes alight, face glowing, you completely believe she's become this heralded leader of an insurgency. She's simply divine. As is Sir Michael Caine, in a showy (although somewhat unrecognizable) role as an aging hippie/ex-political cartoonist who's the cheery, bouncy foil to Theo's ordinarily morose, workmanlike attitude. Caine's wonderful, although seen only briefly.\nThe best part about the movie is, really, the ending. I give nothing away by noting that the film isn't wrapped up in a neat little box, with confetti and unicorns and flowers falling from the sky. The story does have an air of hope about it, but we do not get closure. I think that's for the best; imagine if we had an ending in which Kee and Theo ran off into the sunset, her baby saved and life returning to those pre-anarchy days. Instead of cheating us with such a trite Hollywood ending, the filmmakers decided to continue with the overall maybe bad, maybe good tone, to the betterment of the movie."}

That's essentially the story behind All the King's Men, a reportedly faithful adaptation of the Robert Penn Warren novel of the same name (also adapted in 1949), with Sean Penn as Stark and Jude Law as Jack Burden, the journalist who helped propel Stark to fame and fortune.\nTold from Burden's point of view, the story is supposed to show us that although power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely, or something like that. Burden meets Stark before the latter even enters politics, trying to get a new elementary school built to code. Instead, local cronyism allows the school to be built on the cheap, setting the scene for a fire escape to break and kill three children. Stark decides to try to run things his own dang way, but it's not until he's energized by Burden and by his aide/lover Sadie Burke (Patricia Clarkson, who's excellent here) that he transforms himself from just another white dude trying for some power into a galvanized, vibrant, gesticulating lightning rod for the have-nots in the state. Stark jumps from parish to swampland to hovel pledging to rid state government of fat cats and to work for the people. Somewhere along the way, though, he changes into the very thing he'd vowed to eradicate, all in the name of protecting those who could not protect themselves.\nPenn is good as Stark, although his accent (along with that of most characters in the film) takes some getting used to, thick as it is. If you've ever seen the 1949 version starring Broderick Crawford, though, you might have had in mind someone a bit ...larger, perhaps, more substantial. Penn's a pipsqueak, but he's a damn fine actor, so he's somehow able to essay strength, conviction, and tenacity into a larger-than-life character. Were it not for the frequent incomprehensibility of his diction, Penn's performance might be termed a powerhouse show. But I never got a feeling I knew why Stark changed. One minute he's gladhandling, the next minute he's applying pressure to a retired judge who won't support him (Anthony Hopkins). Where was his motivation? Was it pure greed, lust for power, what? Warren's novel probably elaborated a bit more than Steve Zaillian's screenplay did.\nAt least Penn has a strong supporting cast around him, but Law still didn't feel quite right as the reporter/columnist. Why did he join up with Stark in the first place? (Stark tells him it wasn't for money or because Burden believed in Stark but because Stark was what he was and Burden was what HE was, whatever that means.) Essentially, the character of Burden was just a vehicle to tell the story of Stark's rise and ultimate fall. In fact, that's basically how the other characters come off as well, just window dressing to whatever scene the bombastic (and iconoclastic) Penn chews up and spits out.\nThere's even a contrived romantic subplot - along with the ever-present specter of Buried Secrets - involving Burden and Anne Stanton (Kate Winslet). It's fun to see Winslet and Law, both of whom have done excellent work elsewhere, but the relationship feels forced, as does the character of Anne's brother Adam, played by Mark Ruffalo. Such wonderful, youthful talent, wasted! The twists involving these characters are pretty obvious, leading to hamfisted direction and over-the-top acting.\nUltimately, his remake fails to really grab the viewer, leaving one to watch it dispassionately when we should be rooting for Burden (and Stark, at least at the beginning). It should be a story of manipulation and coercion on both psychological and physical fronts. But it is fun, at least, to see Jackie Earle Haley (remember? The Bad News Bears' Kelly Leak) as Stark's sharpshooter bodyguard."}

If you're like me, you have enough trouble following the spoken words and the images on the screen without also having to wrestle with text. For me, it's especially tough when the movie depends strongly on dialog for its success. So for the most part, I avoid subtitled movies. I'll watch 'em, but it darn well better be an awesome film.\nPan's Labryinth is an awesome film, and I mean that it's both awe-inspiring and excellent. The movie is full of lush imagery that at times cascades gently over the viewer, lulling them into acquiescence, and other times jarring him into reality. It's simultaneously beautiful, arresting, dreamy, and terrifying.\nThe story centers on young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a bookish sort who's been uprooted by her mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to live with her new stepfather Capitan Vidal (Sergi Lopez) in a remote military stronghold in Spain during World War II. The Franco government has just assumed control, and Vidal's troops are there to fight rebels stationed in the woods, all while rationing food to the needy villagers around them.\nAs if this situation weren't unnerving enough, Ofelia's mother is very late in her pregnancy (by the Capitan, of course), and the pregnancy isn't proceeding smoothly; in an ominous sign, the caravan ferrying Ofelia and Carmen to the castle has to stop when Carmen becomes ill.\nOn top of dealing with these very real problems, Ofelia finds herself drawn to a huge labyrinth located in the garden of the vast estate. The housekeeper, Mercedes, warns the imaginative Ofelia not to enter the labyrinth, because its myriad turns would be very dangerous indeed for her young charge.\nIn the middle of her first night in the castle, Ofelia awakes and finds herself drawn to a pit near the labyrinth. Descending its narrow stone stairs, she finds Pan (Faun in Spanish), a servant of the Lord of the Underworld. Pan tells Ofelia that she is actually the Princess of the Underworld, and that she must perform three tasks so that she can leave her human body and return to be by the side of her father.\nTo describe these three tasks would be to give away a bit too much, but suffice to say that they aren't as simple as saying one's prayers or sneaking a loaf of bread away from the kitchen. But Ofelia does choose to complete them; she decides that given the evil of her malignant, torturing stepfather (a despot in training during the Fascist regime), she would rather follow her limitless imagination.\nMeanwhile, a parallel storyline involves the rebels, who have a source inside the castle: Mercedes. Vidal is determined to root all of the rebels out of the woods and exterminate them all, and they are equally determined to overthrow him and return freedom to the masses. As well, Carmen's pregnancy becomes even more difficult, and it is only a matter of time before the three threads come to a head.\nPerhaps the most striking of the many visual desserts in the movie is that of the Pale Man, one of the demons that Ofelia must encounter during her travails. The scene is a banquet table with a lush array of foods and drinks. At one end sits a creature. The creature is tall, but humanoid in shape. It has long arms and arrow-sharp fingers with nails resembling talons. It is hairless and virtually skinless as well, and it has no eyes. Its mouth is a gaping maw, bereft of lips; a cold, stark, ugly beast that immediately fills one with horror and dread. On the table before the creature are two eyeballs; when the Pale Man is aroused, it grasps the eyeballs with its gnarled hands and slaps them into the palms, then holds the arms at head's height in order to see its prey.\nGuillermo del Toro's film is highly imaginative, almost decadent in its lushness, evocative in both beauty and ugliness, in Ofelia's innocence, Carmen's and Mercedes' love, and Vidal's demonic cruelty. Vidal is a terrible sight, a by-the-book murderous fiend who will stop at nothing to completely eradicate everyone who opposes him, including the weak and the infirm. Lopez's performance is gut-wrenching, despicable, and sincere. The precocious Baquero, as Ofelia, is a perfect foil to the haunting Vidal, combining her natural, wide-eyed naivet\u00e9 and curiosity with resolve, intelligence, and self-sufficiency.\nThis original film is Mexico's 2007 entry as Best Film in a Foreign Language for the Academy Awards, and it really should win. Had it been in English, I have no doubt it would have been considered for Best Picture. It really is that good; don't let your aversion to subtitles prevent you from seeing one of the most magnificent films of the decade."}

Well, hey, if Batman can begin again, Supes can come back to Earth, so to speak, right? Only this time it's not the late Christopher Reeve or even George Reeves, it's relative newcomer Brandon Routh as the Man o' Steel. Seems he's been gone lo these past five years in deep space, checking the general vicinity of where Krypton once existed. (Astronomers reported they'd found traces of the planet, so off Superman went to check out his home; oddly, neither he nor the astronomers mentioned that he was leaving.) But now he's back, and so is, coincidentally, Clark Kent. After reunited with his Earth mom Martha (Eva Marie Saint), Clark returns to work at the Daily Planet, greeted enthusiastically by Jimmy Olson ( ) and less enthusiastically by Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who's really moved on. Seems Lois has fallen in love, gotten married, and given birth, all five years ago. Huh, how about that. Her hubby is now an assistant editor at the Planet and is conveniently the nephew of Perry White, played by the magnificent Frank Langella.\nMeanwhile, Superman isn't the only one making a comeback after five years; seems Lex Luthor, put away in prison for what was supposed to be many life sentences, is out on appeal, or something. Anyway, he's up to no good, and it involves killing billions of people and forcing the survivors to bow to him and lavish him with money and gifts and so on. Kevin Spacey plays Lex this time around, and he's a great choice - megalomaniacal without being hammy, which is a fine line. Makes one even forget the great Gene Hackman. (Of course, we all know the pitfalls of having a villain who has a stronger personality than the hero, don't we, Tim Burton?) So Supes is back, and Perry wants Lois to cover his return, but Lois wants to cover this weird blackout that affected pretty much everyone (notably, a Space Shuttle launch that winds up being saved by Superman, as you've no doubt seen in the trailers). Could the two issues be related? \"You're reporters - find out!\" Perry growls at his young charges.\nThere have been scads of comic-book-related movies over the past decade or so, with varying degrees of success, and from what I've read of this one it was a bit of a disappointment, both critically and financially (it made $200 million in the US, but it cost $270 million to make). Having said that, though, I liked it. Plenty of great action, as you'd expect from a director like Bryan Singer (who left the X-Men series just to do this). For a change, the big action scenes don't feel particularly staged, as they can in superhero movies - you know, \"Looks like it's time for Our Hero to.... uh..... lift a train with his bare hands!\" and so forth. There were a few \"ooooh\" scenes that had me gripping the sides of my recliner, especially the plane-about-to-crash scene.\nRouth was pretty good as the Man of Steel: taciturn and resolved but conflicted and isolated. Watching him, I got the impression that there was more going on in his head than there ever was in Reeves' mind; hey, I'm sure Christopher Reeves was a heck of a nice guy, but he wasn't a terribly good actor. His acting style was more cartoony than realistic, and nowadays that's not a good style, even for a comic book movie. But Routh looked the part and, even more importantly, sounded the part as well. (Look for a line from him that echoes his first meeting with Lois Lane in 1978's Superman: The Movie.) Spacey, of course, was a lot of fun as Luthor. Mean, evil, intelligent, with a touch of humor and glee - what more could you ask for in a supervillain? Of course, even Spacey can fall victim to a somewhat tepid script; I loved it when Luthor basically tells Lois Lane his evil plans. This information comes in useful for Lois later on. But regardless, at least Spacey didn't have Luthor laugh maniacally or gesture wildly. You know, hallmarks of cinematic madmen for decades.\nBosworth was miscast as Lois Lane, though. She didn't look the part (check out her huge forehead - how come the set stylist didn't have a lock or two fall over her brow?), and she came off as whiny, petulant, conceited, and..... well, just plain annoying. Other actresses who could have done a better job are Keri Russell, Claire Danes, and Scarlett Johansson, all of whom were considered for the role. It's just a flat performance by an actress who looked at times to be a bit overwhelmed by the role.\nSo, overall - not a disappointment. Not that awesome thriller that Spider-Man was, not as fantastic as the X-Men movies, not as mysterious as Batman, but still loads better than Daredevil, Elektra, and Fantastic Four. Some sincerely harrowing scenes and a solid performance by Routh lift this one enough to compensate for the weak female lead.\n***"}

Benedict travels to Maryland to buy a horse and winds up with Leslie Lynnton (Elizabeth Taylor), whom he takes home to raise a family with.\nBack at the ranch, tension sets in between Benedict's sister Luz (Mercedes McCambridge) and Leslie; the former feels threatened by the sudden new female presence in the home. Headstrong and full of vigor, Luz is the polar opposite of Leslie. (One neighbor remarks that Luz would rather herd cattle than make love; hmm, an early reference to lesbianism? Maybe, and her name might have been a clumsy clue as well...) There's other tension, too, as Leslie doesn't quite comprehend why certain people (read: Mexican-Americans) are treated so shabbily by the Texans. The issue even threatens to drive a wedge between her and Benedict, and she even returns home (with their three kids, by this point), but Benedict's able to get her to return. This turns into one of the central themes of Giant, the idea that the manly men of Texas are the only real men out there, and that everyone else - especially anyone from a different country or of a different ethnic background - is well below them in the pecking order.\nJames Dean, in his final film (he died late during filming), plays a ranch hand turned millionaire with the unlikely name of Jett Rink. Benedict openly dislikes Jett from the git-go and REALLY loathes him when the latter strikes oil on his tiny plot of land and strikes it rich, his wealth soon rivaling (or surpassing) that of Benedicts. Yes, it's another penis-swinging movie, wherein the two leads try to show the other who is, indeed, The Man. Rink is unsteady, an outcast by nearly everyone else in the film, although it's Leslie who befriends him shortly before he strikes oil.\nLeslie is the one character for whom the audience can root, because she's basically flawless. She's the moral compass for the other characters in the film. She rarely raises her voice, but her views are strong. Heck, they're strong right from the moment she meets Benedict in Maryland, as she somewhat unconsciously derides his prideful state. Leslie is a rarity among Texas women, because she's an independent thinker (or so the movie instructs us), so naturally her stiff upper lip runs counter to what's expected of ladies in Texas society.\nBut all of those tensions are only about half of the story, as the kids of Benedict and Leslie grow and mature and have spouses and kids of their own, and rarely do those choices follow what their father intended. Jordy Benedict, played by a fresh-faced Dennis Hopper, decides not to take over the family ranch and to instead become a doctor; he also marryies a Mexican girl, leading to even more tension. And Luz Benedict, named after Jordan Benedict's sister, falls in love with her dad's chief rival, Rink. Late in the movie, the specter of racism rears its head, as Jordy's wife is denied service on the grounds that she's a \"wetback.\" Incensed, Jordy takes matters into his own hands, but his pop's there to help him out.\nThe film itself is beautiful, with breathtaking shots of the Texas landscape that'll leave the city folks in the audience pining for wide-open spaces. Without question, the movie should be seen on a big screen, but since it was made in 1956 it's not terribly likely to show up at any theaters in the near future - watch for revivals or festivals and see it how it was intended.\nOn the littler screen, leaving aside the size issue entirely, the main problem I have with the film is that it's a bit dated. Sure, I know there's still a lot of racial inequality and tension in the world, but I don't think you'll hear the word \"wetback\" bandied about often, and even the way men and women view each other, in terms of respect (even in Texas, yee-ha!), has evolved quite a bit.\nEven if one views the movie as a microcosm of 1950s Texas, it's just not entertaining enough. There's melodrama, there's people acting rather predictably, and in the end everyone grows a little. It's all a little too pat, these lessons of racism and sexism and so forth. Benedict's such a horse's ass at the beginning that you openly hope for his death or dismemberment just so he could get some sense knocked into him.\nAs for the cast, Taylor is magnificent - my GOODNESS, was she well cast! She looks ravishing, with gorgeous wide eyes and a stare that'll freeze her kidlets from fifty yards. She's commanding and beautiful. I haven't seen much of La Liz in her early days, but she's so fantastic here, I should make it a point to see some others. Hudson and Dean are both okay, although Dean's Rink is relegated to mumbling and shuffling most of the time and Hudson's Benedict is stuck with being either a mope or a tyrant. Neither character was particularly appealing, but I never really felt much sympathy toward either, especially for Benedict (although perhaps a little near the end).\nIn smaller, supporting roles, Hopper is delightful, as is Chill Wills as loyal Uncle Bawley and Carroll Baker (in the same year she did Baby Doll) as Luz Baker II, radiant and luscious and just as independent as her on screen mom, Taylor.\nIn all, I found Giant to be a bit of a bore, sad to say, despite Taylor and some great camera work. Watching Giant, despite its length, is sort of like buying a fast-food hamburger; it looks pretty when you see it on the menu, but after you've eaten it you still feel kind of empty."}

But ultimately, the movie's just not all that funny. It's good for a chuckle here or there, but it falls well short of the first Scary Movie. And that's saying something, because the first two SMs were done by the Wayanses, whereas the second two were done by David Zucker of Airplane! fame. How could someone with Zucker's comedy pedigree turn in such a slapdash movie? The basic plot is that Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), who's been in all of the SMs, has just been hired as a caregiver for an elderly Japanese lady, riffing on Sarah Michelle Gellar's The Grudge. Meanwhile, Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko) is a ne'er-do-well crane operator who lives next door and sometimes has custody of his two kids, riffing on Tom Cruise's War of the Worlds. Then alien tripods invade from under the Earth (only they're called TriPods) and kill humans discriminately. But lo! There's a ghost of a boy in the house where Campbell's staying, and he tells her (by spouting Japanese brand names like Seiko and Benihana) that she must find his father, who knows how to defeat the alien menace. And it turns out the father, played by Bill Pullman, lives in a quaint village straight out of precolonial days, complete with a blind woman, two profound idiots, and mysterious They Who Shall Not Be Named creatures, riffing on The Village.\nPerhaps the best sequence is the first scene, in which Shaquille O'Neal and Dr. Phil (the real guys, not actors) wake up in an old public restroom, a la Saw. It's a well-played scene; both personalities come across as sincere, not stiff, and more than a little deprecating (Phil's helpfulness, Shaq's free-throw-shooting ability). The setting is revisited later on in the movie, too, to good effect.\nThere's even a minispoof of Million Dollar Baby, with Campbell flashing back to her days as a boxer and what happened during her final fight. The scene's actually pretty well done, a good aping of the one in the original, taken to the logical extreme. And another one, of Brokeback Mountain, except with African-American cowboys (Anthony Anderson and Kevin Hart), recreating the famed tent scene from that movie.\nSome positives: Faris is reliably good, and Regina King, as her slutty BFF, is a perfect complement. Pullman turns in his standard good-guy performance, albeit with some profanity (at least in the unrated version). Bierko looks enough like Cruise in WotW to pass as his double; the actor does have a good sense of comic timing. One of the running gags has Tom unknowingly neglecting his young daughter Rachel.\nAdding his awesome pipes to the charade is James Earl Jones, as Morgan Freeman did in War of the Worlds. Unfortunately, he's not heard often enough. And we get too much of Leslie Nielsen, who plays President Harris. Nielsen's slapstick skills remain fine, but the script wasn't kind to him; rather than being funny, President Harris made you anxious for a different scene. Besides, making fun of My Pet Goat is so 2001.\nAll in all, the movie's kind of disappointing. Unless, of course, your bar is already low. I mean, it's the fourth movie in the series - will it never end - and by now the jokes have to feel a little stale. Pungent, even. The one-liners often fall flat, despite a game cast; you'll be ducking to avoid the scattershot hilarity. Sometimes this approach to comedy works - throw as many jokes as you can against a reel of film and see what oozes the farthest - but here it just seems like a wasted effort. I think the genre-parody genre peaked a while ago."}

Otherwise we'd all be frozen and speaking Inuit. But I digress.\nLast time, the sudden appearance of a human infant brought an unlikely crew together: a woolly mammoth, a sabre-toothed tiger, and a sloth. This time, Manny, Diego, and Sid have a new mission - get the holy heck out of the way before the giant ice damn breaks and floods everything and drowns all of those who cannot swim, which would be just about everyone. On top of that, Manny (Ray Romano) is fearful that he's the very last of his kind. And on top of THAT, Diego (Denis Leary) must face his fears. Only everyone knows tigers have no fears, so I'm sure he has nothing to worry about.\nAt first, the boys are sure that nothing's melting, there's nothing to see here, please move along, and they tell a gathered crowd to ignore the mad ravings of Fast Tony (Jay Leno!), who's full of doom and gloom and anything else that'll make him some money. (Although what use these animals would have for money is not explained.) But then, at the top of the dammed hill thingy, they notice that the water seems a bit higher and the ice seems a bit less... present. Whoops! Guess everything really is melting after all. So they change their minds (and everyone else's) and head AWAY from the impending doom. Where to, you ask? Well, according to the vultures, there's a boat way over yonder, and if everyone can get over there before the damn bursts, then they'll be able to ride the deluge out.\nMeanwhile, Manny's his usual morose self. Glum, even. He mopes about, wondering if he truly is the last of his kind when BOOM something lands on him from a tree branch. It's another mammoth! Only she thinks she's am opossum. It's a long story (well, about 80 minutes long), but basically Elly was raised by opossums Crash and Eddie and thinks she's one of them, despite the painfully obvious fact that she's about nine tons larger and can't hide as well. But hey, she's not quibbling.\nSo here's Manny, the very picture of awkwardness, Mister Insensitivity his own darn self, and he has to convince Ellie, Miss I'm Not a Mammoth (Queen Latifah) not only that she is indeed a mammoth but that at some point she should totally fall for him so they can repopulate the species. Hey, whatever line works for you, Manfred ol' bean. And Diego and Sid have to put up with the overly energetic antics of the 'possom brothers (Seann William Scott and Josh Peck, the latter from Nickelodeon's Drake and Josh), basically being pains in the butt. Oh, but don't worry, they'll always stick up for their \"sister.\" The movie is mostly enjoyable. It's lacking a little bit of the charm and heart of the original, but since this is a movie aimed at an audience a tad younger than me, it's all good. I sort of found the opossums to be annoying, not clever, and even Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) got on my nerves from time to time. Ironically, although Manny seemed out of place in the first one, he looked much more at home here. Maybe Romano just needed a movie to grow into the role. But the one who sold me wholeheartedly was Leary, who steals about every scene he's in, bringing real life and a sardonic edge to his character."}

She resists, the cops are called, and there's a standoff between Victor and policemen David and Sancho. There's a struggle, and a gun is fired, leaving David paralyzed and sending Victor to jail.\nWhen Victor gets out of jail, his mind is on bitter revenge, especially after he discovers that Elena, now clean and sober, has married the invalid David, who's now a paralympic basketball star. Victor gets a job working at the orphanage funded and operated by Elena (but he's not stalking her, no) and begins to romance Clara, the battered wife of Sancho.\nEach of the five characters, unavoidably intertwined, is complex and morally ambiguous. What are Victor's true intentions? What, even more importantly, are his capabilities? Is Sancho properly haunted by his treatment of Clara and of that fateful night that brought him, David, and Victor together? If Clara does leave Sancho, where will she turn - or is she simply another turn-the-cheek spouse? Does David have a sense of moral superiority because he no longer has use of his lower limbs and therefore has suffered more than most people? And which is stronger, Elena's lust or her loyalty? The quintet, whose lives were forever changed that one night, find themselves drawn back together in a web of intrigue of their own design. All of the actors are fantastic, particularly Francesca Neri, as Elena, and Liberto Rabal, as Victor. The on screen chemistry among all five leads is palpable; no one feels they were just dropped into the movie indiscriminately. Pedro Almodovar's complicated tale is never preachy, and none of the characters are stereotypical. Not all cops are noble, not all drug addicts are irredeemable, not all orphanage operators are perfect, and not all criminals are despicable. Pretty obvious stuff in the real world, but in the land of movies characters are typically painted with as broad a brush as possible in order to appeal to as wide an audience as possible. The movie is tense without veering toward melodrama, and although it begins rather slowly, the final twenty minutes or so are unsettling, nerve-wracking suspense. I defy you to sit complacently while Elena approaches Victor's barrio apartment."}

It's a typical podunk burg, the very epicenter of Hicksville, and the clean n' shiny supercharger doesn't know how to cope. But cope he must, as during his grand entrance he wrecked a good portion of the town's road.\nLightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is a pretty sheltered car - he doesn't even have headlights, since race cars don't need them (the whole track's lit, y'see). But he's not happy with his life as it currently stands; he dreams of winning the famed Piston Cup - even better, of becoming the first rookie car to do so. But the final race of the season winds up a three-way tie, thanks in equal parts to Lightning's refusal to stop for new tires midrace and his apparently long tongue. At any rate, a special race is scheduled in one week's time. Naturally, along the way, Lightning is somehow separated from the truck transporting him, and he finds himself in the active, hoppin' Radiator Springs.\nAt first the judge in town, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), just wants Lightning to leave as soon as possible, but he's quickly convinced otherwise by Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt), who thinks Lightning oughta fix the road he's done tore up. Which is only fair, seeing also as he's the only vehicle in town with enough horsepower to pull the big ol' tarring contraption.\nWhile he's there, Lightning naturally makes the acquaintance of the other (few) citizens. Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), the town tow truck, immediately befriends Lightning; others include Ramone (Cheech Marin), Flo (Jenifer Lewis), Fillmore (George Carlin), Luigi (Tony Shalhoub), and Sarge (Paul Dooley).\nBy now, we're all used to Pixar's animation prowess, but they constantly top themselves. There are no humans in his film. It's not that there aren't any in the story, there aren't any in the cars universe. For instance, the stands at the races are filled with vehicles of all kinds (the inner circle is filled with RV trailers). The motel in Radiator Springs is a series of - get this - traffic cones. The pit crews are made up of small, handy vehicles. There's even a field populated not by cows but by tractors (Lightning and Mater go tractor tipping), watched over by a gigantic plow.\nBut even with all of the cars, trucks, and whatnot floating around, even more impressive is the absolute crystal-clear detail in the backgrounds, particularly the canyon and desert sequences. Even if you pause your DVD player and squint reaaaaally hard, you can't really tell that these aren't photographs. And, of course, when they're moving a regular speed your subconscious can't tell, either. Check out the splash when Sally and Lightning drive through a puddle, and tell me that's not as realistic as a photo. Go on, do it.\nAs with the best Disney films, one has to care about the characters, I mean really care about what happens to them. It's not enough to have someone with dreams of success if that character isn't all that fascinating to begin with. But Lightning McQueen, bless his self-absorbed self, is appealing, even charming in a preening, egocentric kind of way. See, he's never really experienced life outside of his racing existence, and he's always seen his winning the Piston Cup as a way to better himself. Little does he know, of course, that his life will wind up being bettered by the denizens of Radiator Springs - and one certain Porsche in particular - whether he likes it or not! The movie's similar in theme to Michael J. Fox's Doc Hollywood (1991), in which a hotshot doctor gets stuck in a tiny town and has to offer medical services to get his car fixed.The entire cast is a hoot, especially Carlin's hippie, alternative-fuel Volkswagen minibus - a clear descendant of the comic's late sixties' Hippy Dippy Weather Man. Good times, good times.\nThe main themes are enjoying what one has and embracing different and new people (er, vehicles), but there's also a side theme of innocent lost. Radiator Springs takes place on the famed Route 66, just a hair's width away from Interstate 40. It seems that back in the day, Radiator Springs was THE place to stop if one were traveling along 66. But then the interstate was built just to the north, bypassing the town by just a few minutes' drive. And now no one ever stops. It's a wry commentary on the real-life Route 66, what parts of it still exist, a true monument to the American spirit.\nA fantastic ride from start to checkered flag, Cars is the perfect animated feature - gaggles of giggles for the little tykes and a bevy of knowing jokes for the grownup kids."}

All evidence seems to point to the boy as the culprit. A stereotypical Richard Gere/Tom Cruise character (played by Richard Gere), a hot-shot, high-powered, ruthless attorney, decides to go for even more fame and fortune and defend the boy.\nEveryone in the city, nay, the universe believes Aaron Stampler is responsible for the slaying, which of course isn't just a cold-blooded mow-down; no, it's also mutilation, as numbers were carved into the archbishop's chest and his eyes were gouged out. But Martin Vail (Gere) believes he can get his client cleared of all charges; his thoughts on Stampler's actual guilt, he thinks, are largely irrelevant.\nOpposing Vail as the prosecuting attorney is an ex-flame, Janet Venable, played by Laura Linney. (Side question: Has anyone seen Laura Linney and Joan Allen in the same room?) Oh sure, of course she's an ex-flame, because otherwise it'd be tougher to build up sexual tension between the two lawyers, which you apparently must have in courtroom dramas nowadays. The character of Venable seems to exist basically as a foil to Vail; she stomps about angrily, trying to assert herself as a woman lawyer while under the constant threat of job endangerment while somehow avoiding the incredible, awesome charms of Vail himself. I'm sure it was tough.\nVail's gotta find a way to give the jury a reasonable doubt. At his service he has trusty employees played by Andre Braugher and Maura Tierney, but there's only so much they can do. Just when Vail thinks he's succeeding, he's smacked over the head with reality; in other words, like most any other courtroom drama you've ever seen. Will Vail prevail? Did Stampler do it? Well, there IS a twist to the movie; two of them, actually. The first comes a little more than an hour into the movie, after an analysis by a shrink (Frances McDormand); the second, naturally, comes in the waning minutes of the film. Neither is Earth-shattering, and you might even be able to see the second one coming from a few miles away.\nOn the plus side, Gere seems to be having plenty of fun. I know, it's such an unusual role for him, the know-everything Superman who's just sooooo much better than anyone else and doesn't mind letting people know. Quite a departure from his other roles as a know-it-all cadet (An Officer and a Gentleman), a know-it-all stockbroker (Pretty Woman), and a know-it-all reporter (Runaway Bride). Still and all, he turns in an engaging, appealing performance. It's not like he'll knock your socks off with his emoting; it's more like he's just kind of fun to watch. Linney, who's very talented, does a good job as well, although she would get an eerily similar role in 2005's The Exorcism of Emily Rose (reviewed on this site recently). In that film, she was the defense attorney who was trying to assert herself as a woman attorney while under the constant threat of job endangerment. Both movies had the theme of priests in peril; here, it's a murdered archbishop who might not have been an innocent anyway, and in the Emily Rose it's a priest accused of murder by neglect. Well, at least Linney's not being typecast.\nProbably the best aspect of the movie, though, is the emergence of Norton as a powerful on-screen presence. This was his first movie, but you'd never know it by his work here. He's not tentative, he's shifty, perfecting essaying his character's plight and innocence. A strong indication of things to come, as it turned out, as he's become one of America's finest thespians.\nOverall, Primal Fear is a decent yarn carried by strong performances, but the plot twists are nothing to write home about."}

He has the hots for a cute, pious nun and wants to help all the little orphans at his church. It's as awful as it sounds.\nIgnacio (Black), caught as a child by the brothers stealing materials for a wrestling costume, has worked at the church his entire life as the cook, and he's not terribly good - his specialty appears to be nachos - and he yearns to live free, to express himself, to discover wonderful things. No, wait... he doesn't yearn to do those things. He just wants to wrestle.\nBut wait! The new nun, Sister Encarnacion (the beautiful Ana de la Reguera) doesn't like wrestling. It is violent and bad and stuff, she claims. So Ignacio doesn't mention to her that he has donned tights and a mask and wrestles on the weekends with a partner, Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez), a skeletal thief. The two make quite the pair, and they're not very good at wrestling, much like Esqueleto and thieving or Ignacio and cooking. \nBlack probably should have been, pardon the pun, the saving grace of the film, but he's poorly cast and completely unfunny. There's hardly a laugh to be had; what chuckles one gets come from the antics of the seldom-seen orphans, chiefly Chancho. It's not as if Black isn't typically funny, that he's some sort of Serious Actor who hardly ever does funny. He's Jack Black! He's pretty much nothing but funny. Except here, where's he's everything but; he's painful to watch at times.\nBut he's not helped by a meandering film, either. With no belly laughs, one would think the emphasis would be on sentimentality with a dash of light humor. Only you hardly ever get any of that, either, except at the very end with a predictable ending. It's so wildly predictable that you could guess it RIGHT NOW. Without having seen the movie. If this were a parody of fighter films, like Hot Shots was of fighter-pilot movies, then the deadpan deliveries might make some sense - if, of course, they were accompanied by actual jokes, even throwaway lines. Otherwise, one might make the mistake of thinking the movie was set in a more-melodramatic period, where people left their lovers by fog-dampened train and the star quarterback married his sweetheart right after scoring eleventy-five points against Big Mean Old Jerks U in the homecoming game. But it's not that, either; everyone, save perhaps the radiant de la Reguera, seems listless, sleepwalking through a dull pseudocomedy that shouldn't be mentioned again.\nHeck, they don't even get the wrestling part of things right, as Ignacio (wrestling as Nacho) and his various opponents do all sorts of things that would be forbidden in a true luchador match, such as a pinfall outside the ring, the removal of a mask, and so forth. I guess the gang behind this one felt they needed to include more American wrestling features, you know, to sex it up a little.\nAbout the only saving grace is de la Reguera, who, although she's given nothing with which to work, does manage to come out of it looking fine; I'm sure she'll be able to use her role as a springboard to better things, although if I were her I'd put \"Was in Jack Black film\" on my resume and hope no one asks questions.\n*1/2"}

It's charming and exquisitely detailed, and it succeeds where it really counts: It makes you really feel for the lovable lead penguin, Mumble (voiced by Elijah Wood).\nMumble is an unfortunate penguin, you see, because was born with no singing ability, and in his penguin tribe one attracts a mate through the use of song. The poor flightless bird can only look on helplessly as his fellow hatchlings croon their little hearts out. Amazingly, though, Mumble can tap dance, a big no-no in the penguin community. Soon, with no heart song to guide him, Mumble isn't permitted to graduate from school, to the chagrin of his Elvis-like dad (Hugh Jackman) and his songbird-like mom (Nicole Kidman).\nMumble heart belongs to the best singer in his age group, Gloria (Brittany Murphy), but without the gift of song he can't hope to woo her. Worse, with the penguins' food supply running out, some of the other birds begin to blame Mumble's foot-tapping, that somehow he is angering the great god Guin. The sad-sack penguin is then drummed out of the penguin corps, shunned for his lack of song and strength of feet, and he runs into another penguin colony, one that uses pebbles to woo their females instead of song, and makes new friends - a Latino-sounding quartet that's high on life, full of zest and pizazz and charisma, everything that Mumble's old group isn't.\nThen Mumble hears from some predator birds of mysterious \"aliens\" who probe and attach tags to their victims. Mumble thinks these aliens might have something to do with the lack of fishies for everyone to munch on, so he and his new pals head off on a Quest to find these aliens and ask them to stop stealing all the fish.\nSome of the scenes are beautifully imagined, including attacks by sea lions (quite harrowing, actually, until its denouement), vultures, and killer whales, not to mention every time Mumble and/or his posse leap off a cliff and slide down the side like avian sleds. Or through ice tunnels. Or through the water itself, shooting like streaming jetliners with mile-long contrails. Gorgeous animation.\nAt its heart, the movie is about how it's okay to Be Different. It's about how older folks sometimes hold prejudices that are as illogical as they are insulting, and how they'll often pass along those prejudices to their children, sometimes through direct actions and sometimes by dint of their inaction when wrongs are being perpetuated.\nRobin Williams takes on four roles in this movie: the Narrator (where he's excellent and not at all hammy), Ramon and Cletus (two of the feisty new penguins), and Lovelace, a self-professed penguin guru to whom penguins go to have their problems solved. On the one hand, Williams is delightful doing what he does best, improvising rapid-fire comic patter to get laughs; on the other hand, he's Robin Williams, and although there are differences between his voice characterizations, they all bear a strong resemblance to one another. As with most animated films, the movie is well-cast; Jackman is particular has an appealing Southern drawl (ironically, he and Kidman are Aussies playing penguins with southern accents).\nIn the wake of the phenomenal, surprise success of March of the Penguins, Happy Feet makes your heart soar from start to finish. It'll be very difficult not to shed a tear at the mistreatment of Mumble by his peers and his elders, and it'll be near impossible to thoroughly enjoy this dazzling animated offering."}

In fact, it doesn't even take place in the same virtual universe - it's as if those other twenty Bonds never existed. The film takes place in the present day, but it's about Bond's beginnings as a 00. So scratch the 1962-2002 Bond adventures, obliterate them from your memory banks, because they just plain never happened.\nThe film begins with a black and white scene that shows the two kills Bond (Daniel Craig) must make in order to attain 00 status. The two deaths starkly illustrate the types of killing Bond will need to do: One is a brutal drowning in a men's room, and the other is a subtle shooting.\nThen the real action kicks in, as Bond, in deepest, darkest Uganda, is tipped off about a rogue bomb dealer and winds up blowing up part of an embassy. Oops. He's exiled by an unforgiving M (Judi Dench, reprising the role she's had for five films, now), told to take some time off. Because, you see, he's a loose cannon, a ticking time bomb, an egotist who just can't separate emotion from his work. At any rate, we know that this setback won't last long, and sure enough Bond's traced his bomb dealer to a Greek magnate who looks like Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat, and from there he's led to Miami and a thrilling scene at the airport involving a fuel truck and (of course) the world's newest, largest airplane in, like, forever.\nAll of this leads up to the casino of the title, as Bond must play Texas Hold 'Em (replacing baccarat from the 1967 version of Casino Royale) against high rollers, including the Bond Bad Guy, Le Chiffre, an odd-looking Eurocreep who weeps tears of blood. Other than the blood thing, he's kind of bland, but his icy disregard of, well, everything lends a distinct air of haughtiness against which Bond can play. Accompanying Bond is Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), the typical smart/pretty Bond Girl we've seen in the last several films in the series. She's supposed to watch over Bond and all the money he's been staked in the game, but naturally she must keep emotional distance from the Lothario. Can she do that? My gosh, I do wonder.\nMissing from Casino Royale are gadgetry (including Q) and bon mots typical of action heroes. Well, wait, the former's not completely; we do see a nifty tracking device implanted in Bond's arm, but that's not as exciting as, perhaps, the invisible car in Die Another Day, or killer shoes, or something. Also gone, sort of, is Bond's womanizing attitude. Well, it's toned down, anyway; at one point, Bond tells Vesper that she's not his type. What type? she wonders. \"Single,\" says the spy. Ah, so that's how it's gonna be.\nCraig was pretty good, actually. It's got to be monumentally tough for an actor to play James Bond nowadays; with each film, there's more for the next guy to live up to. Roger Moore's first entry was pretty darn good (Live and Let Die), but it still took him a little while to fully grow into the role. Timothy Dalton never did. Pierce Brosnan's work improved as the quality of the movies themselves declined. Craig's ice-blue eyes - those have to be contacts! - say a lot, from a character that plays his cards very, very close to his chest. I think the best thing to be said about Craig's work here is that he acquitted himself rather nicely, and that if he does indeed continue with the role, he'll get even better as he reaches his comfort zone.\nAnd, for the first time in recent memory, the plot's not too convoluted. Several of the Brosnan Bond movies were overplotted to the point of hilarity; there were so many exotic locations and minor characters that it was easier to sit back and wait for people to get killed so you could sort out who was, indeed, good. It's a little easier this time around, although there are a couple of good twists in the final reel of the film.\nAs new Bond Girl Vesper Lynd, Green is appropriately alluring and clever, innocent but corruptible. Will she fall for Bond? Yes, probably. Will he fall for her, though? Ah, that's a much tougher question. Regardless of how it turns out, though, you get a sense that Green is a good match for Craig; she's not taller than him, at least, and they just plain look good together. They do seem to have a palpable chemistry on screen, which is more than one could say for, say, Brosnan and Denise Richards in The World Is Not Enough. At least the makers of this one had the smarts to cast someone who could act against someone who could act.\nThere are two ways to judge a James Bond movie: against other Bond films, and against other action films; after all, Dr. No practically reinvented the action movie, and the subsequent Connery Bonds transcended run-of-the-mill action movies. Casino Royale is an excellent action movie, and it's a highly entertaining Bond film in its own right; a fine first effort by Craig and better than several of those that came before it."}

I wasn't a fan of the bland musical interludes, but the voice characterizations were dead on, and the storyline was charming.\nThe story begins with a battle: a raccoon, named RJ (Bruce Willis), versus a tenacious vending machine. We can all relate to RJ's anguish when the snack just won't come out of the machine, no matter what method he tries. Soon he's bounding up a hill to ransack the cave of a hibernating bear (voiced by Nick Nolte). Who, of course wakes up (early) as RJ is making his escape. Long story short, the bear's wagon of food winds up being decimated by a tractor-trailer in the highway. As a result, Vincent the Bear tells RJ that when he (Vincent) wakes up from hibernation in two weeks' time, RJ had better have returned ALL of the food, plus the wagon and a cooler - or else.\nNext, a heterogeneous group of woodland creatures wakes up in a hollowed log. Led by the organized Verne the Turtle (Gary Shandling), the various critters must now assemble enough food to last them through the next winter as well. Ah, but then they discover The Hedge. It seems that during their long slumber, their beloved forest has been encroached by Suburbia. Gasp! Luckily, new friend RJ is there to explain it all to them and to tell them of his plan to replenish their food supply - raid the houses over the hedge, of course! There are a couple of themes here to teach the kidlets: trust and friendship. As a loner raccoon, RJ has no friends and no one to trust, so he tries to bamboozle the other animals into scrounging up enough food for him to pay off Vincent the Bear. Meanwhile, Verne (who's the smartest of his bunch and the most suspicious) doesn't really trust RJ and thinks his plan will wind up getting some or more of them killed.\nBut this is a cartoon, after all, so wacky hijinks surely win out over maudlin Lessons Learned, although, as with the best cartoon, your younger set will surely take away good, positive themes. Well, that and some great physical comedy, including a scene in which RJ and Verne wind up in an airborne child's wagon.\nThe movie's voices are well cast; in addition to Willis, Nolte, and Shandling, we hear from Steve Carell, Wanda Sykes, William Shatner, and Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara, who are wonderful as porcupine spouses.\nEven the brief, listless musical numbers won't turn off many people, as the movie manages to bring forth the funny while remaining true to the spirit of its predecessor comic strip."}

But Ferrell, miraculously pulls it off.\nHarold Crick (Ferrell) is an IRS auditor who's, shall we say, fastidious. He has routines, you see, from the number of brushstrokes his teeth get to the number of steps he takes to get to his bus stop. A place for everything, and everything in its place. In short, the sort of punctual, detail-oriented soul that an entity such as the IRS love to have on its side.\nEverything's moving along smoothly for Harold, at least as much as it's moving at all. He lives a solitary life both in and out of work and has no dreams or ambitions. But everything changes when he's brushing his teeth one morning and hears a British woman's voice narrating his actions.\nBearing in mind that Harold's well-ordered life could hardly stand even the slightest deviance, it's easy to see how he might completely wig out over this, and that's about what happens. The HR department wants to talk to him, and then he's shuffled over to an in-house doctor (Tom Hulce) and then finally to a college professor (Dustin Hoffman), who tries to figure out the identity of Harold's mysterious novelist through literary means.\nSo now things aren't moving along smoothly, although they are moving along. Until Harold hears some ominous words in his head that suggest that he'll soon be killed off.\nIn the hands of a comedic actor who lacks range, this would have been a maudlin, treacly pile of goo. But because Ferrell is so wonderfully understated, you instantly empathize with Harold. And that's no small feat, considering the wild implausibility of hearing someone's voice in your head; the movie ran the real risk of alienating its audience when it desperately needed it to identify with the main character.\nAnother highlight is the sweet, caring relationship that develops between Harold and Gyllenhaal's character, Ana. Physically, they're an oddball couple - he's quite tall, she's quite not - and personality-wise the two actors seem kind of a mismatch. But although their characters suffer through some necessary awkwardness, the two actors are able to make their union believable and desirable. In other words, they look great together.\nAs Kay Eiffel, the novelist in Harold's head, Emma Thompson brings a coffee-and-cigarettes nihilism to the role; she's supposed to kill Harold off, but she doesn't know quite how to do that; her publisher has sent her an assistant (the always solid Queen Latifah) to encourage things so Eiffel meets her deadline.\nThanks to beautiful performances by Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal, an exceptional supporting cast, and a script that doesn't nosedive into oversentimentality but does sprinkle in some genuine laughs, Stranger than Fiction is an exuberant, charming film."}

The movie was called Gaslight, and it starred Charles Boyer and Ingrid Bergman. But the movie wasn't an MGM original by any means; its antecedent was a much-lesser-known 1940 British film by the same name. (Apparently, when MGM bought the rights to the story, based on a play by Patrick Hamilton, the studio attempted to destroy all existing prints of the earlier version, but they weren't successful.) In the opening scene, an old woman is strangled to death, and her killer ransacks her apartment in search of... well, something. His search is apparently fruitless. Years later, Paul Mallen (Anton Walbrook), a debonair society lord in London, moves with his wife Bella (Diana Wynyard) to the posh Pimlico Square, directly below the apartment of the murdered. Mrs. Mallen is quickly the talk of the neighborhood - she's a little off, they say. Something's not quite right with her. And those wags are right; Bella is constantly accused by her husband of stealing things from him, although she has no recollection of the events.\nMallen uses trick after psychological trick against his wife, although it's unclear to the audience what his motives are. Is he just playing with her? Does he merely delight in her anguish? He even deliberately keeps her from her cousin, a man who'd stood against their marriage at the wedding ceremony. What's Mallen's angle? Unlike its remake, this earlier version is delightfully understated - and bereft of stars whose names would be recognizable in the United States. It's remarkably well lit, too, typical for movies of the period. But where it draws most of its strength is from the two leads. Walbrook, who by that time had been in motion pictures for 25 years, is perfect as the sly, debonair, and viciously evil Mallen; Wynyard exudes vulnerability and panic; her Bella is terrified that she might be quite sincerely insane, vacillating from dignified serenity to sheer panic.\nThis movie is highly recommended to fans of noir film, particularly those who've seen the more-famous 1944 Hollywood version."}

When he makes public appearances he wears a teeny tiny earbud through which his devilish chief of staff (Willem Dafoe) tells him precisely what to say. So it's a make-believe story.\nBut the president, who just won re-election, is suffering from flagging poll numbers, so his lackeys book him as a guest judge on the nation's number one television program, you guessed it, American Dreamz, which is pretty much a total ripoff of American Idol. Like I said, it's a make-believe story.\nMeanwhile, we get a look at some of the disparate contestants. Okay, just two, really, which means we'll see them in the finals. Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moore) is midwest white trash (though her mom, expertly played by Jennifer Coolidge, insists otherwise) who's the champeen karaoke singer at the local bar, where she also waitresses. Omer Obeidi (Sam Golzari) is a terrorist with a conscience who's been exported to the U.S. and has accidentally found himself a contestant on the show.\nHugh Grant seemed a bit miscast as the oily host of the show; this is the kind of role that Quaid might have taken 15 years ago, and Grant seemed a little too edgy and nasty. Sure, that's out of character for him and his usual fawning, cute roles, but it's called acting only if you do it well. A sneering Grant just doesn't completely work; someone with more panache, verve, or any other funky adjective that Brits love to use. Grant's normal charisma just wasn't allowed to shine in this particular role, which held him back. (And hey, how come a Briton is hosting American Dreamz, anyway? Sure, Simon Cowell's British, but he's merely a judge, not The Man in Charge.) Moore and Golzari are both very appealing, and Dafoe is excellent in the few scenes he's in; in a bald wig he looks like he's supposed to be Dick Cheney or Karl Rove, although the role is that of the president's chief of staff. But quick, can you name either of President Bush's chiefs of staff? I didn't think so.\nChris Klein plays Moore's on/off boyfriend; she dumps him early in the movie in a Star Is Born manner (she's going up, he is not), but then they sort of reconcile in an effort to make her backstory more appealing to the American Dreamz judges. Klein appears to be channeling Keanu Reeves, although he leaves the \"whoas\" at home. In short, wooden. But that's okay, because his character is supposed to be a bit of a dimbulb, anyway.\nThe movie is played for laughs, with dashes of seriousness creeping in from time to time, and although it doesn't always hit its mark it's sufficiently entertaining. The denouement might not be a huge surprise, but it's not as if you'll guess everything well in advance. I thought there was going to be more emphasis on the president angle, but most of the focus was on the two contestants and Grant's Martin Tweed.\nIn short, not a bad way to spend an evening. Moore, in particular, is outstanding - and blonde, too, when did that happen? To be honest, she really makes the film come alive; otherwise it might just be a lame parody of current American politics and entertainment values."}

Zany hijinks ensue.\nBorat begins his trek in New York, but when he happens upon an episode of Baywatch in his hotel room. Ah, he spies the luscious Pamela Anderson in her role as CJ the Awesome Lifeguard. Well! That does it for the general-interest piece he was gonna do - he (and his cameraman, and his producer) is off to California! Let the sojourn begin! Now, bear in mind that (apparently) the interactions Borat has with various Americans, of all shapes, sizes, and colors, are completely unscripted on the part of the naive citizenry. Borat travels to a rodeo, where he \"sings\" the Kazakh national anthem to - get this - the tune of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and to the Deep South, where he receives etiquette lessons and attends a social gathering. He and his crew even get lost in Atlanta, where Borat not only gets directions but also some helpful hints on sartorial goodness from some locals.\nThe jokes and jibs always seem accidental, as if Borat is simply this unknowing foreigner who is not wise in American ways. At the same time, the proverbial seedy underbelly of Americans (that is, unseen bigotry) is gleefully, manically exposed; one gets the feeling that those who are exposed have no idea what's happening. They're just being themselves.\nEverything about this movie hinges on Cohen's performance, naturally. If Borat's sexist, racist, anti-Semitic, boorish-yet-innocent persona grates, then the movie's lost to you. And there's Borat in a nutshell - he's all these ugly, nasty things, but he doesn't know he is. Why, he's just Borat, a typical Kazakh peasant. He can't be expected to know of our mores and rules, can he? Why, of course not. (In one memorable exchange, Borat is aghast that women in America can choose with whom they wish to have sex!) There will be some who simply won't like this movie. Those people either don't get the idea of the Borat character or don't have much of a sense of humor to begin with. If Bert from Sesame Street were real, he'd probably wander out of the theater after watching Borat with Ernie, shaking his head, wondering what it was all about. Whereas Ernie would be laughing his furry red ass off."}

I'll forgive you, of course, because I'm nice, but shame on you nonetheless. Both of the previous two Saw films are fantastic horror films, a real credit to the genre. I mean, they're eye-popping in their gore, but there's enough of a psychological undertone do always keep the audience guessing.\nIt is, as you might surmise, the same with III. Only, heavy is the head that wears the crown; the team behind the Saw films are victims of their own creativity. It's one thing to churn out meaningless sequels when all you're doing is splattering nubile twits, but when you're following Saw and Saw II, you have to fight to reach the bar you've set for yourself.\nLuckily, James Wan and Leigh Whannell have done just that. The nefarious Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is back, and as we saw at the end of Saw II, he's not alone - his accomplice is the lovely, the twisted Amanda (Shawnee Smith). Near the beginning of the movie, we see a SWAT team burst into a room where one of Jigsaw's victims apparently exploded from one of the villain's diabolical traps. This might lead you to think the movie will be a cat and mouse game between Jigsaw and the cops, but this notion is quickly quelled when the lead investigator becomes a Jigsaw victim herself.\nJigsaw is all about games, of course, so although it takes a little while to get there we finally get to the story's main game. A young man wakes up in a large wooden box; he eventually is forced through several \"tests,\" each of which is somehow related to the death of the man's son in an auto accident. Can the man (played by Angus McFadyen of Braveheart) face his inner demons by way of these tests (Jigsaw's games carry a moralistic theme)? Meanwhile, as we saw at the end of Saw II, Jigsaw isn't doing so well, physically speaking, so he enlists (er, coerces) a pretty, young, driven doctor (Bahar Soomekh) to keep him alive. Oh, and to entice her to do just that, he has Amanda fit the doctor with a special collar. He wouldn't be Jigsaw without his collars! I may have given away a little too much already, you're thinking, but there's so many twists and turns and sudden shocks that it shouldn't matter much at all. The movie is chock full of pulse-quickening, heart-pounding horrors, from the creeping-up-on-you kind to the WHAM HITTING YOU IN THE FACE WITH A SHOVEL kind; that is, director Darren Lynn Bousman is quite adept at manipulating the pace of the movie to freak you the heck out. Do you like closeups of oozing blood? Limbs and sinews bursting? How about brain surgery, do you have an affinity for that? I wouldn't recommend the movie if you're the kind who has to run from the theater when a needle punctures skin, or if you're pregnant - a couple of these jolting scenes might induce labor.\nSaw III is the latest in what's become the new wave of horror movies: lower-budget films with small, unknown casts that are heavy on shock and plot rather than special effects and pizazz. If you enjoyed any of the previous two Saw films and/or Hostel, if you think watching an autopsy would be a wonderful first date, then Saw III shouldn't cause you much worry - well, maybe other than holding your hand in front of your face sometimes. Not that I ever did that.\nThe ultimate question, of course, is whether there will be a Saw IV, since a recent trend is for movie series to contain only three films. I cannot unequivocally say that there will not be a fourth entry, because although the end does seem final, there is at least one major loose end that could be explored."}

It's a romantic drama - a weeper, if you will - that really has no business being all that good, since it does depend on quite a suspension of disbelief. But work it does, thanks in no small part to the powerful chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves; even more so when you realize they spend, a la Sleepless in Seattle or You've Got Mail, only a small part of the movie in the same scene.\nBullock plays Kate, a lonely doctor in 2006 who communicates, via an apparently supernatural mailbox, with the former resident of the lake house in which she used to live. Reeves plays Alex, a lonely architect in 2004 who lives in that lake house. One thing leads to another, and through the magic of their written words, they begin to fall for each other, much as Tom Hanks fell for Meg Ryan in You've Got Mail before laying eyes on her, or (for you older readers) Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan in The Shop Around the Corner. Alex lives in 2004 at the same rate as Kate lives in 2006; each day proceeds apace.\nIt's all very poignant, especially when other aspects of the lovers' lives play out, allowing the various plot points to weave and intersect with each other. If there's any real complaint to be made, it's that things make a little too much sense, that when anything happens to either protagonist, it's answered later on in the movie. There are no loose ends, which - if one were not completely swept up in the awesome, unlikely romance between Alex and Kate - would seem a little too pat and contrived.\nHappily, one IS swept up. If you're a guy, you can't help feel for Reeves' character here; he has a stubborn, perfect father who's always held his children at quite a distance (played by Christopher Plummer, who's had irascible characters like this for more than fifteen years now), and he has a successful career - though not as illustrious as that of his father, and he's as emotionally silent, living alone physically and emotionally. Bullock's Kate is much the same way; for all of her success as a physician, she merely settles for a man to be with for the proverbial rest of her life; she does so because she needs to, not because she wants to.\nBullock hasn't been this good in some time - yes, much better than she was in Crash, where she was merely annoying. She's sweet and lovable and everything that caused us to fall for her back in 1995 when she did While You Were Sleeping. She's also very well lit, by cinematographer Alar Kivilo. Reeves sheds the \"whoa\" persona - oddly, I totally expected him to recite his trademark when he first reached into the mailbox to find a note from Kate - to turn in a quiet, effective performance that isn't afraid to show its feelings at times.\nThe Lake House is a charming, elegant film that really does unabashedly tug at your heart strings. We know we're being manipulated, but when the result is this entertaining, who can complain?"}
< {"rating": "5", "date": "28 October 2006", "title_id": "tt0407887", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "Very disappointing; poor writing, hamminess sink it", "content": "Matt Damon is a sergeant in the Massachusetts State Police who's secretly working for Jack Nicholson's gang. Leonardo DiCaprio is a former bad boy deep undercover in Nicholson's gang. But whose side is each really on? And will this end in anything but total, major bloodshed? The answer to the first question is, \"Who cares\"; to the second, \"duh.\" Like many people, I went into this movie with high expectations, but unlike most (judging from the early returns), I was pretty disappointed with the result. Let's take a look at some of the good and bad points.\n1. Martin Scorcese directed it, so I was expecting not only a lot of gunplay and a lot of profanity, but a lucid screenplay. I mean, this is the guy who did Goodfellas, for crying out loud, which this movie should have closely resembled. In case you forgot, he also did Raging Bull and Mean Streets. Now, granted, Scorcese didn't write the script, but cmon. He's got the clout to make changes to it on the set.\n2. Jack Nicholson is just all right. I like Jack. (Who doesn't? Seriously.) But nowadays, he plays the same basic character no matter the role, no matter if he's a Good Guy or a Bad Guy. He's Jack. Apparently, Robert DeNiro was approached to play the role of Frank Costello, but he was busy working on his own film, The Good Shepherd. So enter Smilin' Jack, and I dunno; I think DeNiro would have been much, much better.\n3.Profanity. No, I like profanity. Love it! Even gratuitously, it's usually perfectly okay. See, for example, the aforementioned Goodfellas. But it seemed here that profanity was used merely to see how many times the f word and c word could be said in a movie. After a while (say an hour), it quickly got tiresome, sounding more like a high school locker room than anything else.\n4. Comic relief. Who said there needed to be comic relief? Someone must have thought so, because we had not one but two comic roles: Alec Baldwin's Ellerby and Mark Wahlberg's Dignan. Okay, they weren't there solely for comic relief, but they were given funny lines that seemed wholly incongruous with the rest of the picture. Instead of being a subtle change in direction (you're expecting drama and they shift to comedy), the result is jarring. When the timing is right, it works, but more often than not I wondered what the actors were doing in the same movie as Nicholson, DiCaprio, and Damon.\n5. Damon and DiCaprio. I've never been a huge fan of either one, although I've like Damon's Bourne movies to a degree. I think my primary complaint is that they both perpetually look about sixteen years old, not the kind of persona you want in a purportedly gritty crime drama. They both have more gravitas now than they did, say, ten years ago, but still nowhere near enough to carry the heavy workload, characterwise, that this particular type of movie demands.\n6. Accents. The setting is Boston, and most of the leads are playing Irish Americans. Damon, who's from Massachusetts, and DiCaprio sounded fine, but Nicholson's Boston accent came and went - it was usually absent, come to think of it.\nLike I said, the screenplay didn't feel particularly tight; it's as if the writers (William Monahan and Siu Fai Mak) just borrowed from all of the cop films of the past without providing any nuance to hold interest. For example, there was a subplot involving the girlfriend/fianc\u00e9e/wife of Damon's character. Why? I'm not saying we shouldn't know anything about her, but she didn't seem to be much of an influence on Damon's character anyway, so why bother with her? Oh, I see, so that we could include a second romantic angle with her and someone else. But why would we want that? Bring on the guns, bring on the cussin, and ditch the romance - it neither enhances the plot or titillates the audience. (Kristin Dalton, who played the love interest in question, didn't turn in much of a performance, but I don't think she exactly had a layer-rich character with which she could work.) Then there's the obligatory sex scene, which should have felt erotic but came off as awkward, as did the two (yes, two) first-date scenes. Bah.\nHere's a positive remark, though. Kudos to an on-target performance by Martin Sheen, as DiCaprio's boss. Might be his best work in movies in years, kind of an expanded version of his role in Catch Me If You Can, also starring DiCaprio.\nAnother plus, perhaps, is the high body count. Lots of death in this one, and it's not just unknown extras who get whacked. And the deaths are particularly gruesome at times - bullets through the skull, plenty of 'em, leave huge splatters of blood on the back walls of elevators. That sort of thing. A loudmouth audience member to the left of me wailed that it was \"just like a Shakespeare play!\" True enough, because so many of the main characters of those tragedies were slain, usually quite unceremoniously.\nSo maybe I'm just a grump. Maybe I've reached the point where no movie can satisfy me, particularly when I pay nearly ten bucks to watch it in a theater full of incredibly stupid and/or rude people. Maybe I'm too jaded to appreciate true genius. But I don't think so; I think a year or so from now, we won't even remember The Departed as anything more than a slight footnote to Scorcese's great career."}

Yes, before the Internet, you young whippersnapper, before even cable TV. Back then, if you wanted to get a peek of some naked breasts, you had to hie thyself to your corner newsstand and furtively buy yourself a copy of what was euphemistically called \"mens\" magazines. Hey, this was before even Playboy; looking at photographs of nekked chicks was seen as truly deviant behavior, and even then the pictures that appeared in those magazines were, by today's standards, quite tame.\nPage was a naive farmgirl from Kingsport, Tennessee who decided to give acting a try up in New York - and quickly found out that it was those dirty pictures that paid the rent. At first she took the photo gigs as a means to get by while she worked on her acting career, but eventually no one took her seriously as an actress; she was always the \"notorious Bettie Page.\" After her softcore career stalled - thanks in no small part to some witchhunting by Congress - Page converted to Christianity, perhaps subconsciously trying to atone for her \"sins.\" She's still alive, too, although she's stayed well out of the limelight for a long, long time.\nAnyway, Gretchen Mol plays her in this movie. Now, most of you might not be familiar with Mol's work, but she typically plays the girlfriend or young wife or any number of small female roles. She played Matt Damon's girl in Rounders, for example, and I found her to be pretty annoying in it, but she also played the love interest in The Thirteenth Floor opposite Craig Bierko, where she was somewhat more palatable. Could be she's on her way up, ready to be discovered via a huge breakout role, and the role of Bettie Page just might be the one. For one thing, Mol really acts in this movie; she's not there just for show, and she can't get by on her cutesy looks alone. In fact, she really disappears into the role; Mol herself is blonde as blonde can be, while Page was famed for her brunette tresses. Squint a little, and you might be able to tell it's Gretchen Mol, but probably not, and that's a sure sign that her acting has swayed you.\nThe movie moves along pretty steadily, flagging only during the courtroom scenes - which are sparse - and maybe a little near the end, but it's all compact and likable. One complaint might be that we don't get to see far beneath the surface of Page's character; what leads her to the decisions she makes? Some of her earliest history is necessarily rushed (the director wants to get to the good stuff of the bondage and nudity), so Page's motivations aren't always well explored. We're left with a superficial treatment of a fascinating character.\nBut luckily, Mol rises above her material, bringing so much of Page's enthusiasm and mystery that you quickly forget about the nuance issue. Plus she looks pretty darn good naked."}

Seems Nick, Slevin's missing bud, owes The Boss a lot of money. The Boss knows Slevin's not Nick, but what can he do? Slevin's just in the wrong place (Nick's apartment) at the wrong time (the present). The Boss also knows Slevin has no money, so he offers to forgive Nick's debt to Slevin (i.e., not kill Slevin, which is important) if Slevin does a little favor for him. That favor, of course, is killing the son of The Boss's biggest enemy, The Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley).\nThe Rabbi, meanwhile, tells Slevin that Nick owes him money, too, and he gives Slevin a short time to come up with the cash. So now Slevin has to come up with hundreds of thousands of dollars and kill someone. Good thing he's not alone; Nick's neighbor, the vivacious Lindsey (Lucy Liu), concerned about Nick's absence, helps Slevin investigate and contemplate. Also thrown into the mix is a double-dealing hit man named Goodkat (Bruce Willis); no filme noirish movie would be complete without one.\nThe movie feels a little perplexing for the first three-quarters, but then all of a sudden Things Make Sense.

That's one of the debits of the movie, though; there aren't loose ends, there aren't endless possibilities, there aren't nebulous motives, and so forth. It's all too blunt, too black-and-white without even a hint of gray sneaking in from the side.\nHartnett's not bad at all, though, which surprised me a great deal. I've always thought of him as a squinty-eyed dim bulb, frankly. He just seemed like a Big Dumb Guy, kind of like Ben Affleck. But Hartnett turns in a pretty amiable performance in the lead role, although the role was written as a little too glib for my tastes. (Slevin's nonchalant, unserious attitude seems more off-putting and distracting than colorful, even if it's partially explained later on.) Praise should go to an able supporting cast, especially the adorable Liu and the trenchant Freeman. Stanley Tucci, who plays a detective trying to sort out the mess, is also superb as always, as is Kingsley. Even Willis, who by now can do these roles in his sleep, manages to inject some life into his rather low-key scenes.\nAll in all, the movie - despite its cumbersome title - is a bit better than I expected.

Bad movies come from even the best video games, so already Silent Hill has a strike against it.\nBut ultimately what does Silent Hill in is its incomprehensibility. Oh, the plot is fairly easy to figure out, and luckily enough there are a few moments of exposition in which everything is painstakingly explained to the faithful, luckless viewer. It's just that the movie is so darkly filmed, it's often impossible to discern what's happening in any given scene.\nRose (Radha Mitchell) and Christopher (Sean Bean, who's underused) have a young daughter named Sharon (ha, get it, Rose of Sharon? Nah, coincidence). Sharon sleepwalks and mutters about a place called Silent Hill so, against her husband's wishes, Rose decides in the middle of the night (?) to take Sharon to this mysterious place. I mean, who wouldn't? Surely the key lies there and not in, say, locking the door to the house so Sharon can't sleepwalk her way off a cliff, as she almost does in the first scene? Nah, that would be too easy.\nSo Rose gets it in her head to take Sharon there in hopes that the town - a ghost town with a 40-year-old coal fire burning beneath it - will somehow trigger a cure in her daughter. A cop pulls her over on the way, but Rose panics and floors her SUV, and a high-speed chase - at night, in the rain - is underway.

So now she has to go find the little kid. Who she brought there in the first place. I kind of felt my sympathy for Rose ebbing at this point.\nMeanwhile, Christopher is trying to find both Rose and Sharon. He doesn't get to do much other than Fight the Man on the outside, but his actions provide some background to the whole mess (i.e., why is Sharon having these episodes, what is Silent Hill the town hiding, and so on), because he's able to search records, or at least try to access them, leading to confrontations with The Man. Well, the sheriff, anyway.\nIf you've never played the game - which I suspect would be a lot of you - then you'll likely find the whole thing to be a gobberslop of gore. (I'm thinking of trademarking \"gobberslop,\" because I like the way it sounds and I think I made it up.) It's particularly gruesome near the end, but really the entire movie is a crimson cannonball.\nThe ending is a bit open ended, which might be the movie's saving grace. It's left up to the viewer's interpretation. Overall, though, it's not very tightly plotted or interesting - odd, since it was written by Roger Avary, who co-wrote Pulp Fiction."}

I suspect it's not, really, but figuring it out calls for mental powers the like of which I'll never have. The movie does more than merely blur the line between reality and fantasy, it obliterates it.\nFor about two thirds of the film, everything sort of makes some kind of sense. It's weird enough, sure, but it seems to follow some logic. Then Something happens, and the movie goes off the rails. Intentionally, I'm sure - it's the kind of movie for which clues are very, very subtle, and it's entirely up to the viewer to piece them together. Even so, different viewers will come up with different explanations for the events in Mulholland Drive.\nThe basic gist is this: Betty Elms (Naomi Watts), fresh off the plane from Canada, arrives in Hollywood to make her fortune as an actress, along with approximately 40,000 other ingenues each year (taken from the Great Book of Stats I've Made Up). She has it a little easier than most novices, though, in that she gets to stay in the nice apartment of her aunt, an actress who's conveniently out of town and has permitted Betty to stay. Ah, but Betty quickly discovers that she's not alone - there's a naked woman in her shower, and it turns out she's an amnesiac. The woman takes the name of Rita from a nearby movie poster, and Betty decides to help her find out who she is while keeping nosy neighbors out of the loop.\nNow, the viewer knows that Rita was in a car accident on the titular road in the opening scene of the movie. She was being driven in a limo, and the driver pulled the car over and pulled a gun on her. Before he can shoot, though, two drag racing cars careen around the turn, and one smashes into Rita's car, killing everyone except her. She subsequently wanders into Los Angeles itself and hides out at Betty's aunt's place.\nAs with most Lynch movies, though, nothing is what it seems. All Rita has in her purse is a mysterious, oddly shaped blue key - and stacks of money. When she and Betty visit a diner, Rita thinks she recognizes the waitress's first name - Diane - and maybe even flashes on a full name, Diane Selwyn. Could Rita be Diane? The ladies figure out Selwyn's phone number and call it, but they get a recording. Then they visit it, but when they find the woman's apartment, they find Selwyn had switched with someone - and at THAT apartment, they find a dead body.\nBut that's not where it gets weird. In the middle of the night, Rita wakes up with the word Silencio on her lips, and she brings Betty to a strange club with the same name. In what's been described as the most moving sequence in the film, the women watch an interesting performance - first an emcee tells them that \"There is no band\" and that all is just a tape, and then a singer belts out a Spanish version of Rob Orbison's \"Crying,\" which apparently has quite an effect on Rita (who cries) and Betty (who shakes). After the performance, Rita discovers she has a small blue box, and back at the apartment she opens it. And that's about when the movie goes completely nutso.\nWhat does it all mean? I do not know. Who are all of these people? I do not know. I don't know much about this movie, and I just saw the thing. I fear it's entirely beyond my comprehension, but I did find a good analysis of it online.\nI like mysteries. I like having to figure things out, but I don't particular enjoy movies that have a zillion possibilities, depending on how the viewer wishes to interpret things. Or, if that's how the movie's going to be, I kind of wish the clues made some sort of sense. Otherwise, it's just a cacophony of white noise - nothing makes sense, so nothing is there."}

Slowly, the bigots are reduced in number, owing partly to the counteroffensive from the Vietnamese and partly to their own inner turmoil, as an auburn-haired femme from a broken home lends a distracting hand, leading to tragic results.\nThe movie is a pretty rough look at the inner politics of hate gangs. Crowe and his crew have a single mission - the eradication of all nonwhites. In their neighborhood, more and more businesses are being bought or started by those of Asian descent. Hando (Crowe) is a neo-Nazi disciple; he has a copy of Mein Kampf, from which he takes lessons of leadership and purity, and he has a giant Nazi-swastika tapestry in his bedroom. The skinheads are utterly ruthless - they beat, maim, and kill for their cause.\nBut when they roust a Vietnamese nouveau hotelier, all hell breaks loose. Relatives of the victim come swarming after the skinheads at their hangout, waging an all-out war that looks far more realistic than the silly rumbles the Jets and the Sharks used to have. Bloodied and perhaps a little bowed, the racist slugs head for cover.\nBut their headaches are only beginning. Hando isn't the most sensitive guy, after all, so it's not long before his new love Gabe (Jacqueline McKenzie) bears the brunt of his tirades. Meanwhile, she starts to have eyes for Hando's best mate, Davey (Daniel Pollock), who's a much quieter sort. Meanwhile, she seems even daffier than they are, no small accomplishment; she has more emotional issues than a Park Avenue newsstand. But she's pretty and different (the other women in the group are Goth goddesses, whereas she's a redheaded vixen, you see, and an epileptic), so the advantage is hers, sort of.\nA couple of things make this movie watchable: the fast pacing by director Geoffrey Wright and the nascent acting by Crowe. You can clearly see the greatness that would develop more fully a few years later. Crowe's Hando is cool under pressure, but ultimately flawed. He's never shown as weak, though, just morally unyielding. That is, when he shouts at Gabe, he doesn't turn around in the next scene and take her back, admitting his error. He's strong willed and misguided, and Crowe perfectly captures all of the character's nuances, right up to the deadly finish."}

For one thing, the robbers are very deliberate, taking their time to accomplish their task. For another, powerbroker/go-to gal Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) appears on the scene at the behest of the bank's president (Christopher Plummer) to retrieve something that the bank president keeps in a safe-deposit box. Sounds like someone has something to hide, doesn't it? Well, Frazier smells a rat, but nothing he tries seems to work. He at first is content to sit back and let the chief bad guy (Clive Owen) indicate his terms and conditions, maybe get him to release a hostage or two. But there are too many unknown variables at play. No one knows how many gunmen there are, or how many hostages. Or, most importantly, how the baddies plan to escape, since they're surrounded by hundreds of law-enforcement people, vehicles, and guns.\nSo this turns into a cat-and-mouse game between Washington and Owen. From the audience's perspective, we can see that the robbers have dressed the captives just as they themselves are (i.e., gray pullover, sunglasses, and white mask), and sometimes they release one - just enough to keep Washington's Frazier off balance. He can't figure out what they're up to, but he also can't storm the bank and take them by force without risking the lives of an unknown number of hostages.\nThe story is told in overlapping time frames: the standoff and the aftermath. This is instructive to the audience, as we can ascertain how the standoff ends. Ah, but the strength of the plot lies in the details. As the title bluntly puts it, someone - or some people - who were in the bank when it was commandeered were in on the heist. But who? We see Frazier and his partner interview the hostages, trying to ferret out the robbers, and from what they say we can piece together the rest of the story.\nSpike Lee does a wonderful job of maintaining the tension of the situation without really forwarding the plot, but there are some small problems with the script. Washington's character seems a little too glib; he's not quite snarky, just kind of flippant at times, and it doesn't feel right with the scene. I'm not sure if this is a product of Washington's acting or Lee's directing, but the two usually mesh much more seamlessly.\nAll in all, The Inside Man is is a taut whodunnit, reminiscent of movies like Dog Day Afternoon and The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, films that highlighted the congealed multinational humanity that is New York, that should keep you guessing until the end, although it does raise a few questions more than it answers."}

Suddenly, there's a rumbling in the earth, and the entrance is blocked behind them. And that's about when they realize they're not in a mapped cave, but rather a new cave that their ersatz leader Juno (Natalie Jackson Mendoza) wanted them all to \"discover\" and perhaps even be able to name.\nThe women do not fall under the typical categories for horror films; all are strong, tough, kind, resilient, and indomitable. They don't screech at the slightest noise or movement just beyond their line of vision. At the same time, though, they're not all uberfit adrenaline junkies out for another thrill (one character remarks that she's an English teacher, not Tomb Raider). All bring something unique to the team, such as scouting, climbing, or medical knowledge.\nSo there's your situation. Six experienced cavers are trapped in a cave that may or may not have more than one entrance. Will they be able to use their combined skills to find another way out? Perhaps, but the situation quickly worsens, as they discover they're not alone in the cave - one of their number spots a Gollum-like creature climbing the walls and ceiling of the cave. Eeek! The ladies discover that the creatures aren't benevolent at all; they're blind (think mole men, really) and track their prey by sound, like bats, and they're utterly carnivorous.\nThe overall question that the movie poses to its audience is: Will the friends work as a team, as they always have, to escape their predicament, or will they turn on each other? It's not a question with a simple answer; the women all like each other, but they don't necessarily like each other equally, as would be the case in any small group. Take minor tension among them and add a severely traumatic situation, and nerves will be frayed, with possible tragic results.\nDirector Neil Marshall did a fantastic job of scaring the bejeezus out of me at the appropriate times. This isn't a film that just throws a whole bunch of blood and guts at you, hoping something will metaphorically stick. The chills are calculated, sometimes coming one after the other, others laying in wait for the right time to pounce. Marshall's pacing prevents the film from lagging while not overwhelming the viewer with imagery and special effects. I imagine it's not easy to convey true dread and trepidation when most of your scenes are in literal darkness. Indeed, Marshall, who also wrote the screenplay, is perfectly adept at putting the viewer in the place of the six protagonists, allowing us to feel just as afraid as they do.\nTo be sure, there are some minor problems with the plot. Sometimes the connection between certain items is a little too blunt (i.e., the camera lingers on something, so you just know it'll come into play somehow later in the film). But these problems really are inconsequential in the grand scope of the film.\nPersonally, I found it to be particularly terrifying, because I am a little bit claustrophobic. Elevators are fine, but anything smaller than that would make me wig out. Some of the scenes in The Descent take place while the women are crawling through the tiniest crevice in the rocks - that, as a matter of fact, is where two of them find themselves when the cave entrance is abruptly closed. Truly frightening stuff.\nAnother caveat, though: This is a very gory film. People are liberally covered in blood; there are stabbings and guttings and smashings and what not. If you're the type whose own blood makes you squeamish, you'd do well to avoid this film."}

Of course, a few years from now it's not likely the movie will be thought of as anything more than a cult classic, if that, but for the moment we're in the midst of a phenomenon.\nSome have said that the best part of this movie is its title. But no! The best thing is Samuel L. Jackson, for if it weren't for his lending gravitas to the situation, this would be an entirely forgettable movie. Jackson, as he's done in just about every one of the zillion movies in which he's appeared, raises the level of the movie a notch or two every time he opens his mouth.\nQuick backstory: Jackson, playing FBI Agent Flynn, is transporting Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips), a witness to a murder, from Hawaii to Los Angeles. The thug against whom Jones will testify, it seems, has a reputation for doing nasty things to those who would testify against him, but somehow Flynn convinces Jones to take the trip east, and on the plane they go.\nBefore the plane takes off, we meet, in typical disaster-movie fashion, the crew and some of the other passengers, including a flight-phobic man and his wife, a a Paris Hilton-like young woman (and her teeny-tiny dog), two young boys travelling alone, an obnoxious Rich White Man, and a rap mogul and his bodyguards. Oh, and the lecherous copilot (David Koechner) and the standard this-is-my-last-time-out flight attendant, played by Juliana Margulies.\nThe snakes show up a good half hour into the movie. Which is understandable, since it's kind of important to establish characters. Who would turn out to behave above and beyond the call of civic duty? Who would cower? Whose death, indeed, would we openly root for? But then the snakes do arrive on screen, and all hell breaks loose. People get bitten on the EYE. The eye, folks, the eye! Ow! And on the butt, and the groin, and the leg, and.. well, you get the idea. Hardly a body part is left unnibbled, really, and that's part of the entertainment.\nAll kinds of snakes are on the plane, too, including one 22-foot behemoth. Flynn radios to LA so that maybe antivenom could be waiting for them when they finally land. Only, see, because there are so many different snakes, each with a different kind of venom, that's a tall order. Ah, but worry not, there's some deus ex machina at work, so that potential plothole is quickly sealed.\nSome of the movie reminded me of The Poseidon Adventure, only the plane's never upside down. Rather, people are herded into the upper-deck first class (previously inhabited only by Jones, the witness), merely because it's the only place the snakes haven't yet reached.\nJackson adds a lot to the movie. Verily, he IS the movie; his charisma completely carries the film. It's true that the man hardly ever turns down scripts, which means sometimes he's in some utterly awful movies, but he still manages to come out of them all with his reputation as being the baddest mutha in Hollywood intact. Even when he's tender, he's a badass. That's Samuel L. Jackson. He's just what this movie needed.\nThe film does earn some demerits, though. For one thing, I think it could have been campier; sometimes it felt like it was going for a straightfaced plane-in-peril vibe, and other times it was a parody of such films. Other than that, though, I thought it was wildly entertaining, even nail biting. Harrowing moment: When the door to the cockpit opens and all you see are raindrop missiles coming at the plane - and the pilots are incapacitated."}

The main story - Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) must come up with 100 souls to satisfy a debt to supernatural Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), while Will (Orlando Bloom) must retrieve Jack's compass to save Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) from certain death - happily takes center stage, relegating the latter's romance to second-banana status. And that's a jolly good thing, too, because if there's anything to sink this wave-soaring vessel, it'd be a treacly kissy-kissy subplot.\nFrom the outset, bad things are afoot. Jack finds out the time's come to repay his debt to Jones, who commands a huge kraken to destroy ships. So Jack sets aground on a small island, which unfortunately is the home to a cannibal tribe. It's okay, though, because they think Jack's their god, but not so okay when they decide they need to free him from his fleshy existence - by killing and eating his crew.\nWill's sent by the new Lord, Cutler Beckett, to grab Jack's compass, else Will and Elizabeth will be killed. See, the compass leads to a key, which leads to a chest, the chest of one Davy Jones, and isn't it nice when the plot kind of comes full circle like that? I've always loved Johnny Depp. This is his first time in which he plays the same character in more than one movie; he's long been known as a stylish character actor, and the original Pirates made him more of a leading man. His Jack Sparrow is at once iconic and iconoclastic, daring you to like him and root for him despite all evidence to the contrary. Is he a treacherous scoundrel, or will he fight for his friends? Depp is clearly in his element here, making Sparrow his own - I don't think Disney would be able to find a suitable replacement, should the need arise.\nBloom his more than his equal as Will Turner, which was a bit of a surprise. I liked him in the original, of course, but I thought he was a bit overshadowed by the nuanced Depp performance. Bloom's Turner here, though, is more commanding and charismatic, idealistic where Sparrow is ambiguous, a powerful performance.\nKnightley could have been just another pretty face, pouting and showing off her gleaming choppers, she instead is every bit as towering and rambunctious as her male counterparts, slashing and dashing about in a mad frenzy of catlike grace. Compare her work here to that in Domino, which featured a modicum of violence of its own sort, and it's a favorable comparison indeed. Where's the mouselike Knightley I see on red carpets? The final big star of the movie is the special effects and action scenes, from the massive kraken to sinking boats, from plenty of swordplay to chases through jungles and forests. It's a true testament to the on screen magic that while one never stops to think, \"How could this possibly happen?\" one is also never overwhelmed by the bigness, the spectacle, the exasperating premise that louder is better. But the Whoa factor is in full effect, make no mistake.\nFull of spit and verve best suited to an angry pirate, Dead Man's Chest is full of what The Curse of the Black Pearl gave us. More of the same, in this instance, is well worth it, matey!"}

I half expected Tom Cruise to be the lead Action Dude, because forces conspire against Lincoln Six Echo, and his world is not as he thought it was. Shades of Minority Report! (One of the cars from MR even makes an appearance here.) And just about any other Tom Cruise vehicle.\nBut no, we get Ewan McGregor as Lincoln, and I think that's for the best. Lincoln Six Echo is one of thousands of people who live in an idyllic community underground. They've been told that the outside world was contaminated somehow, and they are the last survivors. And every evening, the community holds a lottery to determine which of the inhabitants gets to go to The Island, the last safe aboveground paradise.\nLincoln's been having some odd dreams, though, and he decides to Investigate, as hero types are wont to do, and he quickly discovers life ain't really all that idyllic, as he and the other inhabitants are clones for people in the outside world, clones that are being kept for spare parts or for out-and-out replacements, should the originals actually die. Now, if you were good ol' Lincoln Six Echo, what would you do? You probably wouldn't run to the head of the community, Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean), because he's obviously a bad guy. No, you'd grab your gal pal Jordan Two Delta (Scarlet Johannson), who's just won the nightly lottery, and amscray. And naturally, then all hell breaks loose as the fugitives are chased hither and yon.\nSay what you will about most Michael Bay movies, that they're loud, incomprehensible babble masquerading as a seamless plot, but the movies can be quite entertaining if viewed with the right perspective. Bay uses his trademark pulsating soundtrack that coincides neatly with the on screen explosions to great effect, interspersing plenty of well-done chase scenes around such plot movers as the Helpful Friend (played here by Steve Buscemi, who's very well cast) and the Mercenary with a Conscience (played here by Dijimon Hounsou, from Amistad).\nIt's sort of like watching an amalgam of The Sixth Day, Minority Report, and Payback, with a dollop of Armaggedon tossed in as a dessert topping. McGregor is far better than Schwarzenegger, Cruise, or Affleck could hope to be, and Johansson does very well in a love-interest role, certainly doing more for the film than the film does for her. Also appearing is Ethan Phillips, who once played Peter on the long-ago TV series Benson, and Michael Clarke Duncan, another winner of the lottery.\nSo aside from the loudness and the sometimes poor writing, The Island really isn't all that bad, owing in no small part to the appealing, symbiotic performances by McGregor and Johannson.\nThe Island: ***"}

This naturally causes consternation and confusion among the myriad mutants. Do they take the medicine and leave their life of mutancy? Or do they renounce it, choosing to remain true to themselves? Magneto (Ian McKellen) doesn't want to take the chance, realizing that with this serum the government - which has been hunting him - could effectively eliminate all mutants, whether they want to be \"cured\" or not. His plan is to raise an army of disaffected, resentful mutants and destroy the serum - along with any who stand in his way, including Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his team.\nThere are plenty of other subplots, all of which intertwine gracefully with the main thread. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), thought to have died at the end of X2, reappears - but is she the same Jean Grey they all know and love? And what's up with her and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), anyway? And what of poor Rogue (Anna Paquin), who's frustrated at not being able to hold her boyfriend Iceman (Shawn Ashmore)? The screen crackles with sexual tension on many levels, among many mutants. And of course many of the mutants' powers carry an undercurrent of sexuality all on their own.\nNew to the cast is Kelsey Grammar as Hank McCoy, aka Beast, the Secretary of Mutant Affairs. He's big, blue, and furry, and he's basically the liaison between the mutants and the government. Only the government's a little leery of mutants, now that Magneto's waging war against them.\nYou know how there are some movies that give you OH MY GOD moments? I don't mean wowie-kazowie special effects - like, say, moving the Golden Gate Bridge - I mean more like I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY DID THAT TO THAT CHARACTER! Even if you're not an X Men fanatic, you do have a sense of who's who in the X Men universe, who's more important than whom. And more often than not, although you know bad things will happen to the heroes, they'll probably all live to fight another day. In X3, though, there's a strong sense of unease throughout the movie - indeed, will they all survive? i've heard conflicting reports about whether this is the final X Men film, but I really hope not. In fact, I'd prefer an X Men 4 to a spin off of Wolverine or Magneto, or any of the other characters. This is a cast of characters that acts supremely well as a team, and my impression is that however compelling the actor is, the characters might not be strong enough to carry a film on the level of the X Men films. I mean, look at Daredevil and Catwoman.\nAll in all, the X Men movies have been progressively better, never letting up and never allowing the viewer to get comfortable with the plot; doing so would lead to the usual predictable, unimaginative story lines that sink most big-budget movies."}

It has a bona fide leading man in Tom Hanks, a cute French femme fatale, a centuries-old mystery, and Gandalf/Magneto/Ian McKellen. It's longish, and perhaps a little overplotted (though not for the millions who've read the book on which it's based), but when it was over I felt satisfied that director Ron Howard had gotten it right. As usual.\nThe curator of the Louvre is found murdered, but before finally expiring he leaves a cryptic message in his own blood that induces Chief Inspector Fache (Jean Reno) to contact a visiting Harvard scholar, Robert Langdon (Hanks). Fache thinks the message indicates Langdon's guilt regarding the murder, but another officer, Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) feels otherwise. What was the curator trying to say? The chase - and effort to prove Langdon innocent leads the duo around Europe, immersing them deep in the legends of Jesus Christ, the Holy Grail, the Knights Templar, Opus Dei, and Mary Magdelene. It's important to remember, though, that the book on which this movie is based is a work of fiction. For the learning impaired, that means the author makes no claims of authenticity - the storyline has been concocted for the purposes of entertainment.\nAlong the way, Robert and Sophie meet up with Sir Leigh Teabing (McKellen), a Grail scholar/devotee/nutcase. McKellen spins a yarn about what everyone's really after, managing to deal a couple of serious blows to the basic tenets of Christianty as we know it in the process. And no, of course I'm not going to note what those surprises might entail, although by now most people have an inkling or two.\nWhile Robert and Sophie struggle to find clues regarding the curator's murder - and clues pertaining to the Grail itself - other, more sinister forces are afoot. An albino monk (Paul Bettany) has the mission of finding the location of the Holy Grail - and then preventing at all costs anyone from ever finding out. Then there's a semicorrupt bishop and the Pope, but they both just have cameos. Not the real bishop and Pope, though; that would be quite the casting coup.\nHanks is well cast. If we're to believe the rumors, Bill Paxton was Howard's first choice. If you're Tom Hanks, how do you deal with your favorite director wanting Bill Paxton over you? It's gotta hurt at least a teeny bit. On the other hand, Tautou was chosen instead of some pretty strong competition, like Sophie Marceau and Julie Delpy, and she has excellent chemistry with Hanks. They're not supposed to be lovers, just two semirandom people thrust into increasingly odd situations. Both roles are well written, and the actors are well up to the task.\nAs good as Hanks and Tautou are, though, McKellen is extraordinary, owning every one of his scenes. Sir Ian has given plenty of commanding performances in recent years, and although this one may someday be dwarfed in retrospect by the roles of Gandalf and Magneto, it's no less compelling.\nThe Da Vinci code is perhaps even better than the book, because the book wasn't terribly good. A riveting, well-paced religious-mystery/thriller is supplemented nicely by a fine cast."}

It's all they've ever wanted - even better than Amsterdam! The girls are gorgeous and (most importantly) willing, especially concerning young Americans. Even better, the boys have to room with two local lovelies who like to walk around naked and party hardy with their new friends.\nBut strange things are afoot. Ole (Eythor Gudjonsson) goes missing; the front desk says he's checked out, and his pals Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson) receive a phone message from him saying he's gone home. And a Japanese guest at the hostel says her friend's missing, too. What's up with that? The first half of the movie is titillating, with plenty of go-thither scenes of fantastic debauchery, wickedly enticing the average male viewer with promises of drinking, toking, and hardcore fornication. I mean, how dare they? Here I am, trying to write a serious review of a nasty horror movie, and they have to muck it up by showing me plenty of gratuitous nudity! Not that there's nothing for the rest of the audience. Okay, there's not much. The first half is aimed squarely at the heterosexual hedonist male. But then we get to the second half, and we get to see what happens when Josh passes out in his room and wakes up in the torture chamber.\nThis is the moment you'd start covering your eyes, shooing small children from the room, warning people with heart conditions, and so on. Of course, they probably didn't watch the nakedness, anyway, and in fact aren't even in the room, choosing instead to lambaste you from the other side of a thick door. I mean, how dare you bring such filth into their home? Why don't you bring it into your own home, you pervert? For the most part, the blood looks awfully real, but the editing is so well - pardon the pun - executed that you hardly have time to see how authentic it all appears. The point is, it feels darn authentic. Everything, from the actions of the psychopaths to the reactions of the victims feels pretty sincere.\nScary, creepy, and disgusting, Hostel is of the same - ahem - cut as Saw: a polished, well-shot (heh), squishy-sick horror film."}

I'd like to think that, but I'm not that much of a professional. The truth is, when an actor becomes overexposed or otherwise annoying, it registers in the back of my mind. So the next time I see them in a movie, that dormant part of my brain thinks, \"This person's irritating!\" And so it is with Tom Cruise. Poor Tom! He's in the papers more for his shenanigans than for his oeuvre. Couch hoppin', medication dissin', baby makin', and brainwashin', that's our Tom. Kind of puts a few dents in his long-cultivated image of Tom Cruise, Actor Man. So, unfortunately, I sat down to watch M:I-3 already prejudiced against Mr. Cruise.\nBut regardless of how you may feel about Tom cruise, Actor Man, the movie itself just isn't all that good. It's bombastic, trying desperately to distract you with noise, noise, and more noise, so much of it you'll feel numb afterwards. The Mission: Impossible movies are swirls of gunfire, explosions, and grit, but without much in the way of substance - or plausibility.\nIn this installment, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) has left IMF for a new career as a trainer, and he's fallen for a pretty nurse named Julia (Michelle Monaghan). He's done, he's out, he's moving on - except, oops, they've brought him back in. Seems an agent's been captured, and for some unknown reason only Ethan and his old team can retrieve her. This is just the first improbability to hit the plot.\nHunt's nemesis this time around is black-market dealer Owen Davian (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), who's after something called the Rabbit's Foot, and Hunt has to stop him. Has to, you see, because Davian's got his new bride, and he's not messing around, understand? A running theme in recent Cruise films has been that his characters always get set up by someone. Mission: Impossible. Minority Report. Vanilla Sky. This one, too, sadly, but it's not really a surprise. The man is just a bit too trusting.\nThere are some whaddya-kidding-me moments, such as when one character, having seconds earlier been taught how to fire a gun, shoots a few guys dead without so much as wasting a shot. You know, believable stuff like that. But mostly the action comes at you so quickly that you don't have time to ponder the holes in the plot. Ah, but just when you're figuring it's a lot of sound and fury, there will be a scene that completely stops that ill-gotten momentum in its tracks, as shots linger on expressionless faces for no apparent reason other than to give us a chance to grab some snacks.\nWith the third director in the series, it seems the M:I movies try a little too hard to top each other (not to mention their contemporaries) in terms of visual effects. Cruise is still a good action hero and leading man, and he can certainly carry a picture even if his star has dimmed somewhat. Frankly, he's a little more believable in these thrill rides than he is in the \"small\" movies, like Collateral or Vanilla Sky; when the plot gets center stage, he simply doesn't have the range.\nM:I-3 isn't a total waste of time, but it's no longer fresh and exciting; it has its own minilegacy that it must live up to. Judged thusly, it's probably a good thing (for it) that the movie debuted in theaters before the new X Men movie."}

A band of rebels, wishing to overthrow the Goodchild dynasty, sends an assassin named Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) to kill Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas). But Aeon finds that things are a little more complicated than as first surmised. Turns out there are mysterious things afoot, and when Aeon learns this, the rules and her mission change dramatically.\nSuperstylish and straightforward, the movie is an extension of an old MTV animated short. It's a lot of fun to watch, and even the plot isn't boggy or otherwise incomprehensible. And that's saying something, because so often these movies tend to have some kind of intentionally murky plot, the better to distract people from the fact that it's badly written. This film doesn't quite perform that little parlor trick; in fact, even though the special effects are the main attraction, the storyline does stand up to close scrutiny.\nTheron, as usual, is fantastic; she brings spirit and panache to a role that would have been much less effective with a straight-ahead action femme. She comes across to the viewer as commanding, strong, and mentally and physically tough. In short, an outstanding performance by a wonderful actress.\nShe doesn't get much in the way of support, but it's not really because the other actors aren't as talented; the film is, after all, called Aeon Flux for a reason. Csokas and Jonny Lee Miller as Trevor's brother are both a grade or so better than bland. They're not particularly colorful characters. Sophie Okonedo, as Flux's compatriot Sithandra, fares a little better, but her role is even smaller.\nThe visual effects in the film are a real delight, particularly the land around the inner part of the city, where the reigning family lives; there's supersharp grass, trees that fire upon intruders, and so on. Inventive, even mesmerizing, each scene is brilliantly woven with the next, creating a tapestry of oh-my-goodness images.\n(Side note: The group for which Aeon works is called the Monicans.

How can she possibly choose between them? Well, since this is Hollywood, we know that True Love will somehow carry the day. The question is which of her flawed suitors Mirabelle will accept into her heart.\nI've always like Clare Danes, who's the kind of actress who sort of slips under the radar of most people. She usually plays spunky yet elegant, refined yet quirky young ladies. She's a good choice as Mirabelle, who can do little but stand by and watch the world overtake her. Mirabelle is poised, but she isn't where she wants to be in life - as if working at Saks Fifth Avenue were a mindless chore. The trouble is, she works at the glove counter, and gloves don't sell well nowadays, particularly the classy, highfalutin, long gloves that Saks sells.\nEnter not one but two new loves, or at least occasional strong likes. Jeremy (Schwartzman) lives in Mirabelle's building and meets her at the communal laundry room. Constantly poor and sloppily dressed, Jeremy nevertheless possesses an offbeat charm that wins over the ennui-laden Mirabelle. Ray Porter (Martin) gets Mirabelle's name from Saks and sends her a gift. Kind of creepy in today's society, but since Ray's so refined and classy and all, Mirabelle doesn't seem to mind too much.\nSo does Mirabelle fall for Ray's nonostentatious philanthropy? Will she think she's found the man of her dreams, while Jeremy goes on the road with a rock band? I dunno, but I sure wish someone had done something to someone at some point. I like Danes, I like Martin, and I like Schwartzman, but I didn't particularly like them in this movie. The movie, written by Martin (from his novel) was slow, plodding along with little or no exposition or development. I'm sure this was meant to convey a sense of reality, that is, that people in real life are really like this. Maybe, but it makes for bad film. Mirabelle is a nice girl, very attractive, but she's boring. Ray has money and class, but he's even more boring (the characters even note their own boringness following a particularly fascinating dinner).\nOnly Jeremy brings any kind of spark to the plot, and thank goodness Schwartzman got the role instead of the callow Jimmy Fallon, to whom the role first belonged. Whenever Schwartzman - the latest of the Coppolas to have a film career - appears on the screen, I woke up and took notice. He has oodles of presence, and he lent quite a bit of it to the proceedings as Martin and Danes merely faded into the background. Which isn't meant to imply that Schwartzman was hammy, far from it! His was the most sincere performance in the film.\nAll in all, I found Shopgirl to be mildly interesting, if only because Martin wrote the book (and provides the toneless narration). The bottom line is that likable characters are sometimes quite dull."}

Domino's been captured by the Feds in a bounty hunt gone terribly awry. Coolly smoking a cigarette, with blood dripping from her nose and mouth, Domino decides to answer all of the shrink's questions. Time for full disclosure.\nDomino explains how she got bored with hanging around her pool in Beverly Hills, how she detested the \"perfect\" culture in southern California (especially the show Beverly Hills 90210), and how she especially hated joining a tony sorority. No, the life of the privileged wasn't one for Domino. So she became a bounty hunter.\nThe two other members of her team are Ed (Mickey Rourke) and Choco (Edgar Ramirez), two mean-looking, tough-acting hombres who can and do shoot and kill as easily as you or I might butter a slice of bread. But they - and Domino - manage somehow to get the job done, jobs funneled to them by bail bondsman Claremont Williams (Delroy Lindo). But then one of Claremont's mistresses' granddaughter is dying, and she needs a superexpensive operation, so Claremont hatches some kind of scheme to rob an armored car and then return the money minus a finder's fee.\nWhich is briefly why Domino finds herself in an interrogation room with Lucy Liu. Lucy Liu with her calm demeanor that's meant to get under your skin. It seems that Domino's future is at least partly up to this psychologist, but the scenes are really just a device to relate Domino's experiences to the viewer.\nKnightley seems an odd casting choice, but it's a fair assumption that the real Domino Harvey had a similar body build. Knightley is tall with big, dark eyes, and she sure isn't muscular, about what you'd expect a fashion model to look like. (I think she goes a tad overboard with the eye makeup, but what do I know?) The film moves along at a frantic pace, with scenes sometimes a little out of chronological sequence, the better to distract the viewer from a rather straightforward plot. The producers threw in a made-up subplot involving counterfeit DMV identifications to spice thing up a bit (tying it with the armored-car plot, too). So there are double crosses and setups and all manner of untrustworthy behavior.\nIn the end, though, I didn't learn a heck of a lot about Domino other than the more superficial of descriptions. If the title character had not been a true-life person (the real Domino died in 2005), the movie would have felt pedestrian, even mundane. Domino Harvey surely led a fascinating life, and we do get a glimpse into it, but it's only a brief glimpse that focuses on one, career-ending caper (or is it?), making the movie much more sound and fury than one that concentrates on character and plot development.\nI know, I know, Shakespeare it's not supposed to be. But I didn't want it to be - I wanted panache, verve, and sizzle, and I got one dimensionality and fizzle. Here's a question for you. Sure, Domino is good at nunchucks, and we do get to see her use them once. But that's about it. She doesn't typically use a gun, and she's not strong enough to beat a bounty into submission. So what's her big talent that makes her such a viable part of the team? Oh, that's right. Sex appeal. In one memorable early scene, she offers a lapdance to bad guys in order to get information. Sure, that'd happen in real life. You have ten guns aimed at her, and you're going to give her information for a lapdance that you can get anyway at the local strip club? Okay.\nSo, bottom line - Knightley's cute, but she doesn't quite have the screen presence to sufficiently dominate (pardon the pun) the movie; at no point was I really convinced she could kick my ass. Which would make her a pretty poor bounty hunter indeed.\nDomino: **1/2"}

And then the big company is sunk by unethical behavior on the part of its CEO (Alec Baldwin), and suddenly the Harpers are without jobs, money, or prospects. Desperate, Dick decides to turn to a life of crime - and, as it turns out, they're pretty good at it! When the duo runs into the former financial officer of Dick's old company (Richard Jenkins) they decide to try to get back the money that the CEO had swiped (i.e., the pensions of all of the lower-level employees). A scheme is hatched, and madcap hilarity ensues.\nAbout 45 minutes elapse before the Harpers begin to rob businesses, which is about 35 minutes too long, in my opinion. I mean, the premise of the movie is that they have to become criminals in order to survive, so why waste half the film leading up to it? On the other hand, maybe there's only so much one can watch of the Harpers robbing Starbucks and head shops before one's head explodes.\nThe laughs are generally scattershot. Carrey comes off best, because he's always excelled in playing manic, exuberantly broad characters. He's well cast, and so is Leoni as his equally flighty-funny wife. Because the actors are such good fits for the roles, the movie's not altogether unentertaining; they do much more for the movie than it does for them. Adding able support is Baldwin as the heavy and Jenkins as the disgraced CFO, now a lush. An interesting running gag has the Harpers' son speaking with a Spanish accent (and occasionally in Spanish), thanks largely to his being raised by their Spanish-speaking nanny.\nDick and Jane is amiable enough, but it's not as consistently funny as it should have been."}

Nick would have you believing your lung cancer has nothing to do with the industry he represents, Big Tobacco, and that the real issue here is the freedom of adults across America to choose what they want to choose, and isn't that worth fighting for? Nick (Aaron Eckhart) is so slick, he's able to accuse an antismoking advocate of hoping that lung-cancer patients die, because if they lived then he (the advocate) would see his budget slashed. Then he tells a shocked studio audience that his organization is launching a $50 million campaign to discourage kids from smoking. Slick and effective! When not spinning, spinning, and spinning, Nick commiserates with fellow spokespersons for industries of ill repute: Polly (Maria Bello), the liquor companies; and Bobby Jay (David Koechner), the gun companies. Together, they are...... the MOD Squad, wherein MOD stands for Merchants of Death. A little gallows humor is necessary when you peddle mortality.\nAnyway, the idea is that Nick must spin Smoking Is Good, from deriding \"questionable\" scientific studies that disagree with his premise to lobbying Hollywood for more product placement (that is, no more would cigarettes be held in movies only by Bad Guys or Europeans - the heroes would get them, too). Oh, and pay off the Marlboro Man (Sam Elliott, who's bitterly dying of cancer. And deal with a duplicitous boss (J. K. Simmons, who plays J. Jonah Jameson in the Spider-Man films). And be spirited about by the Head Honcho of Big Tabacka, The Captain (Robert Duvall).\nIt's a lot for poor ol' Nick, but that's not all - he has to be a role model of sorts to his young son, who dotes upon him while living with his mom (and her boyfriend) in Nick's house, while Nick gets an apartment.\nBut don't feel too bad for Nick, since he gets to shag nearly every female in the story. But not in the movie, since it's not a movie of infinite length. But then I'm comparing the movie to the book by Christopher Buckley, and that's not entirely fair.\nThe problem with the movie is that it's wit, so wicked and sharp in the book, has been dulled a bit; it feels Hollywoodized, as if everything has to be Just So. As if it's okay to point and laugh at the absurdity of pimping for cigarettes from a distance, but not to get in close and snark at the details.\nThe story also suffers from a shifted focus. In the book, Nick's relationship with his son was one of the lesser threads, but in the movie it's at the forefront. My guess is that the makers (including the director and writer, Jason Reitman) figured this would make the movie a better sell across various demographics. This is what happens when a plot gets Hollywoodized - it tries to appeal to too many people. Kind of odd for a movie that wasn't supposed to be a blockbuster, anyway.\nOn the bright side, the casting is spot on, particularly Eckhart, who is aces in roles of dubious morality. Sure, he's an insufferable, randy cad, but he's not a nasty jerk, so we kind of root for him but deplore his intentions.\nJust about everyone else is a secondary character, except for Nick's son, Joey (Cameron Bright), and thankfully the young actor wasn't melodramatic or maudlin or hammy, or any of a number of thespianic maladies that affect novices. Point of fact, he was quite charming and convincing.\nNot so convincing was the often-miscast Mrs. Tom Cruise. How is it the Katie Holmes keeps getting grownup roles when she looks like she's about two years late for her high school reunion? (Side note: Holmes' character, a reporter, is described in the book and the movie as having nice breasts. This wasn't weird to see in the book, but it made no sense in the movie, as Holmes herself is, uh, lacking.) The bottom line is that Thank You misses the mark just a tad by way of a shift in plot focus and a dulling of sharp satire."}

The vivid photography of this documentary evokes an always-harsh climate, so dangerous that many of the birds don't survive the trek.\nHow the penguins navigate from point A to point B is still quite the mystery, as the winds and water can alter the terrain so that it appears to be completely different than it had the previous year. The penguins march, mostly single file, and when they're too tired to walk, they propel themselves on their aerodynamic bellies. When they get to their vaunted breeding ground, the males seek out females - and trust me, you haven't lived until you've witnessed two penguins courting each other. They all look alike, even to each other, you see, so they must seek out their mates by making mating calls. The female is somehow attracted to a particular call, and she hooks up with the male. Thankfully, we're denied a visual of this last action.\nAfter mating, the penguins huddle for warmth, waiting for the female to lay an egg. Penguins don't lie down, normally; they stand. After laying the egg, the female shuffles over to the male with the egg between her feet and nudges it over to the male, taking care not to let the egg touch the cold ground or be exposed to the turbulent air.\nThen the female makes her second long journey - this time to feed herself and bring back food for the young'un. While she's gone, the male babysits. Neither daddy nor baby have any food at all during this time, which can span three months. The females find their food and come back to feed their offspring, while the male undertakes his own second long journey.\nThe culmination of all of this walking and waiting is that ultimately the hatchlings are left to fend for themselves. Mama Penguin leaves first, then a bit later Papa Penguin goes another way. The babies look at each other and then go off on their own as well, heading toward the ocean, which by this point is much closer (i.e., the ice and snow has melted), and take their first plunge into the deep.\nMarch is wonderfully photographed, especially considering how close up and personal the viewer can get to the birds. My goodness, these are real penguins, not autoanimatronic creations of some wacky Imagineer! If these penguins had facial expressions, you'd have seen those, too. The intimacy works very well, especially during the egg transference, detailing the ritual quite nicely.\nAnother major plus is the stentorian narration by Morgan Freeman, who lends plenty of gravitas to a film that didn't really need it to begin with. The result is an Oscar winner for Best Documentary feature."}

If not, then you're probably better off skipping it entirely. The heavyhanded writing and direction by Joss Whedon, coupled with the hamfisted, cardboard acting of Nathan Fillion, reduce this big-screen offering to just another mishmashy sound-and-fury action movie.\nThe setting is 500 years in the future. Owing to overpopulation, denizens of Earth have emigrated to other worlds, known as the Core planets, where life is pretty darn good, and trade and communication betwixt the planets is booming. Mal Reynolds (Fillion) and the crew of his Firefly-class spaceship Serenity travel the heavens, taking on jobs that usually skirt the edge of legality, and sometimes dive headfirst over said edge into a pool of sin.\nMal's crew includes his second in command; Zoe (Gina Torres); pilot Wash (Alan Tudyk); muscular hothead Jayne (Adam Baldwin); mechanic Kaylee (Jewel Staite); and three passengers-turned-crew - Simon, the doctor (Sean Maher), Simon's sister River (Summer Glau), and Inara (Morena Baccarin), a Companion (otherwise known as a high-class call girl). Over the course of fifteen episodes, the crew becomes used to one another, just as devotees of the series will have grown accustomed to their faces. This is key; the more you know a character in a TV series, the more forgiving you'll be if the subsequent movie doesn't explain everything sufficiently, because you'll have the requisite background information already.\nSimon and River are fugitives; Simon busted his sister out of a government facility, where faceless drones picked apart and brain and drove her quite crazy. Trouble is, no one knows what she's capable of, and throughout the series she's shown flashes of skills beyond that which a typical teenage girl should possess. In the movie, River's instability is making things tough on the crew; because the government is looking for her and Simon, Mal must turn down jobs in order to fly below everyone's radar. So times are tough, and tensions are running high.\nWhen River - apparently directed subliminally - engages in a m\u00eal\u00e9e against a fewscore men (and wins) and Simon subdues her with a safe word, the pressure for Serenity to hand over the fugitives increases dramatically. Just before succumbing to the safe word, River utters her own mysterious word - \"Miranda.\" Who or what is Miranda? Warning: Don't read further if you're a big Firefly fan. You're not going to like it...\nSerenity felt to me like an amateur-hour show. Yes, the effects are pretty cool, although nothing spectacular. But the writing's subpar. Whedon seems to have a pretty good sense of plot movement - no time for exposition or reflection needed - but he's not so adept in characterizations. I got the distinct feeling that the actors, for the most part, rose above their stilted dialog to turn in fine, appealing performances. Particularly effective was Baldwin as the scoundrel Jayne; he does get some of the funniest lines, but more importantly he knows how to deliver a comedic performance. Appropriately adorable is Staite as Kaylee (dig those everlit eyes), and flawlessly elegant is Baccarin as Inara.\nBut the one character on whom the entire show and movie rest is also the one that's the most confounding - Malcolm Reynolds. Ethical vagueness is a very good descriptor for your characters to have; why announce his or her intentions every step of the way? But this can be problematic when the character is constantly changing attitudes and approaches, and those changes don't make a heck of a lot of sense.\nFor example, there have been numerous times in which Mal has performed some sort of loyal act for his crew, even the fugitives. That's honorable. But then there have also been numerous times in which he's laid down the law, tyrant style, to that same crew. I don't mean with a simple my-way-or-the-highway approach, because that's certainly not unacceptable from the captain of the ship. I mean in a cruel, hateful manner. Here's what it boils down to for me - you can be a lovable Han Solo rogue, or you can be a mean despot, but it's really tough for any actor to play a character who's both. A good actor, perhaps, could pull this off, and Fillion is not a good actor. He has very little range; when he's joking, he wears this weird half-smile, not quite as developed as a sly grin, and when he's upset, his voice gets thick as week-old jelly. And that's about it.\nBut back to the movie itself. I liked the plot, although certainly the fact that the show was over by the time filming begun played a huge role. The problem with this kind of approach is that a movie can feel as if plot devices were thrown in just for the sake of throwing everything into the mix. To clarify that statement would be folly; I'd risk spoiling some fun for you who haven't watched the movie yet. What I'm saying is that although there are plenty of surprises, since the movie is based on a well-known TV series, you get this sense of nothing really mattering - it's not as if there'll be a Season 2 with the consequences of those surprises apparent.\nI think Serenity (which, sorry, sounds more like adult diapers than a ship name) looks merely like a TV movie writ large; it's not as exciting or intriguing as the show was, for all its foibles, and I think that although blinded-by-the-Whedon acolytes will no doubt think it's the bee's knees, the rest of us can do better."}

Wonderful musical numbers abound as well, featuring the beautiful voice of Danny Elfman - especially a complex jazz/scat number.\nIt's really tough to find fault with any of the voices, which feature a number of former Burton collaborators, such as Depp, Elfman, Christopher Lee, Michael Gough, and even Deep Roy, who played the Oompa Loompahs in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\nAlthough this film was up for a Best Animated Feature Oscar, don't think for a moment that your three-year-old is going to like it, musical numbers or not. The tone isn't as dark as Nightmare before Christmas, but the settings sure are. I mean, the movie takes place mostly at night, either in a dark forest, inside a dark, stark mansion, or the Land of the Dead. Not exactly the place you might find pastels and a lava lamp.\nWatching Corpse Bride, it's easy to forget it's not animated in the traditional way, or even the nouveau-artiste, computer way. Fourteen puppets of the Bride and of Victor were used in the making of this movie, and some 109,000 individual frames were filmed. The attention to detail is preposterously exquisite and should leave the average viewer properly dumbfounded."}

It's artful, if perhaps missing a dash or a smidge of subtlety, but not so much that one is entirely distracted from the somewhat pedestrian, familiar plot.\nV is a vigilante, a lone avenger who wears a Guy Fawkes mask and wants to extol the masses of a somewhat-futuristic London to rise up against their oppressors, throw off the yoke of totalitarianism, and watch their favorite buildings explode.\nIt's the near future. Britain no longer has a queen or prime minister; instead, it has a chancellor, an ominous man named Setler (John Hurt) who appears on giant TV screens, a la Big Brother. And freedoms have been seriously curtailed, especially free speech, owing to three terrorist incidents in which nearly 100,000 people die. This leads to state-controlled media, secret police, and so-called black baggers, the men who come in the middle of the night to round up people deemed Bad by the government.\nWhen a young Londoner named Evey (Natalie Portman) is caught out after a state-imposed curfew by the secret police and is then attacked by said defenders of the realm, a debonair, eloquent masked marvel springs to her aid, dispatching with her aggressors with all due speed. He quotes Shakespeare and looks like a Musketeer, complete with swirling black cape and superpointy blades, but wears a portentous mask - that of noted British rebel/hero Guy Fawkes, who once tried to blow up Parliament some 400 years ago. The mysterious man rescues Evey and spirits her away to his secret lair. Later, he shows her part of his plans as a famed statue detonates.\n\"You can call me V,\" the man says, and although the letter stands for Vendetta in the title, it's also a good stand in for Vengeance, Vituperation, and Vanquishment. Clearly, V is harboring some kind of grudge on someone, and he's going to try to turn the country upside down, show the populace how corrupt and Fascist their government - which they've elected - has become. He's an anarchist at his heart, it seems, but could there also be a more personal vendetta rampaging in his mind? V sees Evey as a necessary ally and enlists her in his cause, an entreaty she accepts. But is she willing to go as far as V is? From the scared-kitten look on Portman's face through much of the movie, one would assume she's not quite sure she's made the right choice.\nAt times, the movie is very powerful propaganda, demanding that the viewer draw parallels between the celluloid events and those occurring in the real world today. But it's not heavy handed in its execution; everything that we see on screen is quite plausible, at least in the context of the fictional futuristic London.\nThere are some similarities between this film and the Matrix series, also by the Wachowskis, including the overall look and feel of the set designs and the idea that we're all being controlled by someone or something else. But unlike The Matrix, V for Vendetta isn't terribly deep of a movie; it's not a movie that invites endless philosophical discussions about Who We Are and Why We're Here. We know just enough for the sake of the movie, and we're not left wanting to know more. There aren't many twists, nothing to keep your brain hopping along, always wondering what might come next.\nThere IS one big twist, however. Some viewers might think of it as a shaggy-dog outcome, though, and others might completely buy into it. It's the kind of twist that may well make you scratch your head and wonder if the actions in the twist were really all that necessary - the old ends-justifies-the-means adage.\nHugo Weaving, so wonderful as Agent Smith in the Matrix movies, plays V, and although we never once get to see Mr. Weaving's face, he turns in a powerful, commanding performance. You can feel what V feels, and without the crutch of a countenance on which to make expressions, this is fantastic acting indeed. Portman is okay as Evey, but her character wasn't sufficiently substantive, which is my way of saying I don't think it was Portman's fault. I think she did an admirable job considering what she had to work with; in this movie, Evey is relegated to less-than-sidekick status.\nAnd I would be remiss if I did not add that the final scene is both satisfying and unsatisfying, which makes it a little frustrating. Part of it grabbed my heart and made it soar, but part also did seem a tad expected.\nV for Vendetta is, at times, invigorating, exciting, revolutionary, and terrifying, but it's a little slicker than its subject material should indicate."}

In this film, purportedly by one-time horror great Wes Craven, pretty hotel manager Lisa (Rachel McAdams) is the victim-protagonist, the tough woman-in-jeopardy who must do what one must do to save her pa (Brian Cox) and the director of Homeland Security (wha?), while some 30,000 feet in the air, from smarmy dweeb Jackson (Cillian Murphy).\nThis preposterous movie is nothing more than your typical damsel-in-distress plot, except it's set almost exclusively on a plane, where the limitations of the storyline, the acting, and especially the directing are painfully obvious. This red eye could use a real shot of Visine, or maybe just an eyepatch.\nThere really isn't much more to say about the movie, which is thankfully short. If you think there might be a serious question as to whether she'll save her pappy from the long gun of the assassin, this is the movie for you. You probably won't even wonder at the stupidity of all involved, or even the perfunctory, underwhelming thanks shown at the end for a job well done. You might not even mind that a hotel manager was able to save the world from a greater evil pretty much all by her lonesome, without needing to cave in and call real professionals.\nMcAdams gives it a good try, but she just can't carry the film herself, and the burden of also having to put up with a crappy script is too much. Murphy makes for a dopey, cardboard villain - maybe he should stick to playing henchmen - and Cox is solid as always. Still, one expects a little oomph from a Craven film, some style, something, but this one's utterly faceless."}

Joaquin Phoenix, the bad guy in Gladiator, as Cash? Reese Witherspoon, the cutie pie in Legally Blonde, as June Carter? It would have sounded like a flop borne of hubris and greed.\nBut Phoenix and Witherspoon turn in incredible performances, surely the best of their short careers and among the very best of the year. Phoenix IS Cash - singing the Man in Black's song in perfect imitation. Witherspoon is smashing in what's hopefully a breakout role for her, after so many fluffy, nondescript comedies.\nLike most biopics, this is a story of redemption, of rising and falling and finding that those who remain with you in your time of need are the ones that should be kept around, their reluctance to do so be damned. We follow Johnny from his early childhood, including the tragic loss of his brother and the rejection of his father, to his opportune recording for Sam Phillips, and his meeting, courtship of, touring with, and proposal to June Carter. In between, we get a pretty good glimpse, courtesy of Phoenix's stunning performance, of the ghosts that haunted Cash throughout his life.\nIt's no surprise that the music is so good, since they're all old Cash tunes, but the fact that Joaquin Phoenix is singing them does offer up a bit of a curveball. Both Phoenix and Witherspoon so completely immerse themselves in the well-known characters of Johnny and June that one would almost expect some caricature, but there's nary a dishonest, insincere beat to their incredible work here.\nDirector James Mangold, who previously directed Girl, Interrupted, hits no false notes here, where even the slightest misstep might have had rabid Cash fans clamoring for his head on a spike. Vividly shot, the film is highly evocative; you feel at times that you're crawling inside Cash's brain, the atmosphere is so intense.\nAnd although this is a movie about a man's rising from his own ashes, one of its core themes is also its most wonderfully realized, that of true love and friendship. June Carter stands by her man through all of the bad times, even when his family, particularly his shrewish wife, abandon him out of selfishness and spite. From the first moment Witherspoon and Phoenix share the screen, you can tell they're made for each other, with dazzling chemistry that ultimately lifts the movie to its greatest heights."}

I saw The Core last year, and although that one wasn't too good it did have a sense of humor about itself. In other words, it was harmless fun. But when I saw that a movie called The Cave was coming out, I figured we'd all soon be getting a stern lecture on the dangers of spelunking, a treatise on Man versus Creepy Beasties. In short, I expected The Cave to take itself way too seriously.\nI was a bit surprised. Sure, it lacked wit, but it wasn't witless. An old church in a remote area of Romania lies in ruins, blocking what appears to be the entrance to a huge cave. Tough-minded, superskilled cave divers are brought in to investigate. Some remains of previous attempts are seen. Then there's a cave in (who saw that coming?), and our heroes must find a way out while surviving against the yet-unknown inhabitants of the deepest, darkest cave.\nThe group is made up of smart people, hotheads, and hotheaded smart people. Okay, they're all a little smart, but some are more hotheaded than others. It's also important to note that there are two females among the cavers, and since we have a good idea that some in this intrepid band won't make it back alive, the odds are that at least one of the females will die. The question is, which one? To make a simple plot even easier: They dive, there's a cave-in, they can't get out, they must go deeper and deeper, and then they run into things that kill them off, one by one. And some things that play with them a little. The film moves pretty quickly, but that's a double-edged sword. On the one hand, one doesn't have time to dwell on plot problems, but on the other hand, action scenes look like an MTV video; you can't see what's happening, not at all. Who's fighting whom? Who's winning? I see that so-and-so got a scratch later - what gave him that? And did he give as good as he got? The characters aren't fleshed out at all, which isn't strictly necessary in these movies. Thankfully, the screenwriters decided against there being any romantic entanglements; why distract the viewer from the real attraction, the journey into the unknown? But one interesting bit about character development - even though these cavers have apparently worked with each other for eons, they're quick to jump on Jack (Cole Hauser), their leader, for his command decisions. That is, they don't seem particularly like a well-oiled machine.\nThe film's pretty well shot, especially considering nearly all of it takes place in a cave. Hey, it's tough shooting in a cave. It's dark, everything looks to be the same color. Leads to boring, boring, boring scenes. The director here got around this by using different colors for some of the scenes, anything to differentiate them from the previous scene. Still, you won't find any gorgeous vistas here.\nAt any rate, the plot is mostly plausible, the creatures are seen only glancingly (which is usually a good thing), and the characters aren't too cardboard. (The acting, however, was a tad wooden all around.) Henry V this ain't, but it might tickle you if you're in the right frame of mind."}

Then they're informed they have to find a way out of the house in a matter of hours, or the nerve gas they've been inhaling will strike 'em dead as a doornail. Naturally, some booby traps aim to prevent this.\nThis follow up to the 2004 original could have lapsed into typical sequelitis and just been terribly derivative and dull. You know the drill: Kill a whole slew o' people in horrible, disgusting ways that in no way further the plot. But Saw II doesn't quite stoop that low. The horrible, disgusting killings do indeed further the plot.\nI am reminded of an old radio program called The Shadow. You might recognize the name, since Alec Baldwin played the titular hero in a 1994 movie. But it began in radio, and there was one episode called \"The House That Death Built.\" In the episode, people were offed in creative ways by booby traps, such as a gas chamber and a series of shotguns.\nIt's usually difficult to translate the unseen horror, like radio can, to a full-length feature film, and indeed most movies fail to do so. But Saw II does do so. You know right away these aren't characters we're meant to find appealing, or root for. No needless attention is paid to their backgrounds; all that you get on each character is all that you need to put things together. No dialog is especially wasted, and that - along with the always-fun gore - is what makes this movie work.\nOf course, if you don't like blood in your film, you're going to really hate this one. It's everywhere. People spurt from all sorts of orifices, plus some new ones. But things don't seem to be done with the intent to shock, another point in the movie's"}

Her dad Hank works at the local mine, and when Josie runs into an old (and female) schoolmate who encourages her to join the company, Josie reluctantly does so.\nBut she finds it's not easy - and that's not even including the work itself. The men resent her and try every kind of harassment they can think of. The women want her to sit down and take it so they don't have to suffer, too. Her dad hates her, because she's in a man's job (plus, he's a real misogynist jerk), and her mom doesn't like her much either, because Josie did, after all, leave her husband, and you're supposed to stand by your man.\nSee where the problem lies? The movie tries hard to paint each character with one brush only, and then beats you over the head with that characterization for much of the movie. The script is so obvious, it's tough not to see the big setup coming, and sure enough it turns out that not all men ARE bad. Why, some were merely confused, and by gosh they're gonna do the right thing, here in the final ten minutes of the movie! The movie is bookended by court scenes, as various characters testify against or on behalf of the suit. Much of the movie deals with the (sometimes literal) crap that Josie and the other women had to go through, although she's the only one with any kind of gumption to do do anything about it.\nTheron's pretty good, although this isn't a \"gettin' ugly\" kind of role like that of Aileen Wuornos. Her Josie actually looks pretty throughout the movie, for the most part. But Theron hit all of the right notes and might even have deserved her Oscar nomination. Frances McDormand plays her tough-as-nails friend, who's a union rep at the plant. McDormand is a great actress, and she turned in a good performance in a made-for-Oscar role. Woody Harrelson (yes, can you imagine) is solid as Josie's lawyer, a former hockey player.\nNorth Country is manipulative treacle, but even the toughest miner would melt a little during the final scenes, but it's an outcome that's telegraphed from the get-go. The fun should be in getting there, but when the characters are given laughable, overwrought dialog to mouth, it's as much fun as.. well, maybe working in an actual mine."}

But it's soon obvious that there's more to Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) than meets the eye, particularly when three unsavory characters show up in his diner calling him \"Joey\" and alluding to a past in Philadelphia.\nDavid Cronenberg's latest is a mildly fascinating look at what can lie beneath a seemingly innocuous surface, but it turns out that those hidden layers are even shallower than the top one. Josh Olsen's screenplay doesn't invite close scrutiny, and his knack for crisp dialog is nearly nonexistent. Too often, events weren't trumpeted well ahead of time by loose writing.\nMortensen is effectively earnest as Tom, and the ethereal Maria Bello is mostly perfect as his wife (she oscillates from subtle to hammy). Ed Harris is on hand as a one-eyed baddie who's after Tom. And William Hurt has a showy role as a mob big boss. Note that I said it was showy and not meaty; it's not a particularly interesting role, and Hurt seems out of place. Still, he managed to get his fourth Oscar nomination for the movie, which might be more of an indication of the weak supporting-actor field this time around.\nThe movie seemed well cast - at least it wasn't miscast to the point where I noticed - and it moved along at a pretty quick clip. In retrospect, that seems a little strange, since there were tertiary story lines that simply didn't need to be explored. For example, Tom's son Jack (Ashton Holmes) is having trouble with a bully at school. Do we see that storyline somehow dovetailing with the main one? Nope, it's just there to toss in some gratuitous violence. Same with the sexcapades of Tom and Edie - yeah I know, a married couple, who knew - their games didn't necessarily add much to the plot, but they were a fun diversion.\nI do wish there'd been more depth given to the main characters, especially Tom. What's been his motivation? Why did he change? These questions are answered almost offhandedly, in a pat manner that won't satisfy most viewers. Why didn't Cronenberg explore these questions further? Instead, he padded the running time with sex and violence that, while entertaining, didn't do much to further the story. It's impossible to get into details about that, though, without ruining some of the plot.\nA History of Violence does grab you right away, but then it drops you, wanders aimlessly, then keeps you riveted for the final few scenes. Olsen's weak script is helped enormously by Mortensen and Bello, upon whom the bulk of the acting load rests - at least until Hurt chews the scenery. There's just enough intensity for the movie to work, although the final scene seems anticlimactic, indeed."}

It should show that despite the taboo of same-sex relationships, love and compassion can reign supreme. Instead, we're stuck with a deadeningly dull piece of slop that would put any sentimentalist to sleep if there weren't so many goshdarn panoramic views of mountains.\nJack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis del Mar (Heath Ledger) are itinerant cowpokes who sign up to herd a mess o' sheep across Brokeback Mountains, and during the long drive, they fall for each other. Only it doesn't happen gradually, it's lust at first sight, after a cold night in a hot tent up in the mountains. After that, it's decades of pining and not immediately getting what one wants.\nI honestly believe that this movie has been such a big hit (critically and commercially) because of its same-sex theme, rather than because of its, oh I don't know, good acting or script. The plot is exceedingly simplistic; it's so easy to follow, you'll be able to predict the next scene with ease. But because the two principals are men, suddenly what's such a humdrum story ascends to an exalted level of genius.\nMake no mistake, it's a pretty picture to look at, and I do recommend watching it with the sound off. Maybe you love lovely scenery - there's a lot of gorgeous setting. Or maybe you're a straight woman or gay man and think Ledger and Gyllenhaal are hot hunks. With no sound, you'll be very happy. Turn the sound on, though, and you'll quickly realize there's no there, there. The problem with being a Beautiful Person on the outside, of course, is that people often assume you're a dullard inside. When Ennis or Jack speaks, there aren't pearls of wisdom that come dropping out; no, they're more like balls of silt, spoken either sotto voce or outright mumbled, the better to fame the words as Profound. There's nothing profound about the movie, other than the vast infinity of the untamed mountains.\nThe movie perks up only when other actors show up. Randy Quaid has a few short scenes, and he easily outacts the younger leads. Michelle Williams, who plays Ennis's wife Alma, and Anne Hathaway, who plays Jack's wife Lureen, light up the screen when they're there, showing more vigor and passion with the hook of an eyebrow than either of the lunkheaded leads can with every expressionless countenance they can conjur. Ledger, who seemed to be channeling Steve McQueen's look, mumbles incoherently through much of the movie; this was partly owing to the chaw in his mouth (I presume), but still - when trying to be Profound, it is wise to be Understandable.\nI believe that this movie was swept up in hype, as people were first astonished at the man-on-man sex scenes (which looked and sounded as loving as a rape scene, although I'm no expert on gay sex scenes) and then proud of themselves for deigning to watch it. It's a real shame a taboo like this couldn't have been broken by a solid, adult film instead of the crappy, one-dimensional clich\u00e9s and characterizations that screenwriter Larry McMurtry came up with; somehow, in the world of this movie, laconic equals deep."}

Yes, it's a culture-clash movie, a fish-out-of-water dollop of treacle and mush. Only not well done.\nGeorge and Madeleine have been married just a few months, but no one in George's close-knit family has met her. It's obvious from the git-go that they're from different worlds, when Madeleine does that European kissy kissy on both cheeks thing. And she's quickly introduced to the clan - mother Peg, dowdy and domineering; father Eugene, taciturn and methodical; brother Johnny, angry and ignorant; and sister-in-law Ashley, pregnant, optimistic, and unburdened by brains.\nThere's not much of a narrative at work here; Ashley quickly senses she has someone new to talk to and adopts Madeleine for the short time they'll be visiting. Exuberant and bouncy, Ashley chats idly with Madeleine but reveals to the rest of us that things aren't all that good with her and Johnny, who's struggling through the nuances of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in a GED class. While interacting with Ashley and the rest of the family, Madeleine finds time to attend a church function with them, too. You know, the family that churches together.... or something.\nAmy Adams, as Ashley, garnered an Oscar nod for her work here, but to me it wasn't anything special. In fact, the entire movie is nothing special, because nothing happens. There's no real plot development, and there's certainly no character development. I kept waiting for something, a twist, an epiphany, maybe Ashley saying, \"That's it, Johnny, I'm leaving!\" or something. Anything. None of these people had a pulse.\nWhich leads me to the one aspect I did like - Scott Wilson as Eugene, the dad. He has the fewest lines of the main characters, but he made every one of them count. Eugene is an amateur woodworker, and a man who's content to just let things be what they are. He's not the type to put his arm around someone; he just keeps on keepin' on. Eugene, in other words, just is, while everyone else floats like butterflies and stings like bees.\nThere are some unexplored themes in the movie, which always aggravates me. For example, there might be a scene with two people, and maybe some blunt hints are dropped as to What's Really Going On, and you think, \"Hm, I bet they resolve this somehow!\" but they don't. They never do. This should have been known Unresolved Mysteries."}

Howard plays DJay, who pimps girls out of his beat-up Chevy Nova. When he comes into the possession of an electronic keyboard, DJay plays around with it and finds he has a talent for writing and performing hard, violent lyrics.\nOn its face, this seems like a typical \"man rises from the ashes of his hardscrabble life to experience success and then watches it all crash down around him\" kind of movie. It's not a movie about suffering, success, and redemption, in other words. But it's not as predictable as it may seem at first blush, and Howard is not your typical actor, by any shot.\nDJay lives with his small stable of prostitutes in a tumble-down shack in the Memphis ghetto. As pimps go, he's not exactly Donald Trump. Some dance for an exotic club during the day and hook at night; some hook all day. But the money's not rolling in for DJay, who remains somewhat confident that he'll someday come out ahead. When he obtains the keyboard, inspiration strikes, and a chance encounter with an old classmate (Anthony Anderson) who's now a producer (of sorts) gives DJay the opportunity to jump out of the rotten life he's carved for himself.\nThis never feels like a typical rise-and-fall story, and that's thanks in no small part to the powerful performance by Howard, who's much better here than in the critically lauded (by some) Crash. Appearing with Howard in Crash was Ludicrous, who also has a big role in Hustle and Flow - hey, some rappers are very good actors, it turns out. Howard, aided by a crisp script from Craig Brewer, who also directed, never portrays DJay as simply a nice guy with some flaws, someone who's been handed a bad hand and is making the best of it. It's clear that DJay's made all of his own choices, and the situation he finds himself in - depending on hookers for his livelihood - is of his own doing.\nBut neither does the script show DJay as being entirely bad, either, as evidenced by some surprisingly tender, moving scenes between DJay and Key (Anderson) and DJay and Shug, his pregnant woman. These scenes don't come off as stilted or insincere, and that's thanks especially to Howard's strong performance. True, too, are the scenes in which DJay lays down a rap track in his home; you can feel the rage seeping through your television.\nThis movie might be a difficult sell to those who have trouble relating to the environment and atmosphere in which DJay operates. Undoubtedly those who grew up on the wrong side of the tracks will recognize aspects of their own lives, identifying strongly with one or more of the characters. But even those of us who have never lived in squalor, who've generally had advantages that others do not, can appreciate the intense, gray world in which DJay and his associates live. Had this been a simple, typical biography of a musician from the mean streets, it wouldn't have had near the effectiveness, the passion of Hustle and Flow. The movie intrigues you, makes you want to know what happens to DJay, even when it's obvious he's a bit of a jerk. But because he's not a stupid man, his actions cannot be painted as simply good or simply bad. Howard, in particular, is well deserving of his critical accolades here."}

I felt the movie was pretty poorly put together, to be quite frank about it.\nAlthough it's a biography of the writer, the film covers the time Capote spent researching and writing his magnum opus, In Cold Blood, from his assignment by The New Yorker to cover the legal proceedings to the final publication of his \"nonfiction novel,\" several years later. The focus is on Capote's relationship with the murderers of the title, particularly Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.). Capote figures if he gets close to Smith and Dick Hickock, he'll get information he can use in his book. Is he using the killers, or does he really care for him? You wouldn't know from a movie whose script has Capote constantly talking about himself, no matter what the topic is. What, you killed four people in their beds? Pshaw, you should hear about my upbringing. And on it goes.\nAs I said, Hoffman's performance is quite mannered - some might say flamboyant - and there will no doubt be plenty of you out there who will think he was spot on, quite a show, and all that. And there will be plenty others who think about five minutes of hearing him \"talk Capote\" would be about four minutes too long.\nSo on to the others in the cast. Catherine Keener, who's been so great in movies like Being John Malkovich and The Interpreter, acts circles around Hoffman. Yes, circles. Keener plays novelist Harper Lee, she of To Kill a Mockingbird fame, and she absolutely disappears into the role - with two exceptions, her dazzling, dancing eyes. Keener is superb, clearly deserving of her Oscar nomination. Lee has a pretty good idea of what Capote's all about, as does his lover, Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood). Chris Cooper is along as the sheriff in charge of the case, and Bob Balaban is Capote's publisher.\nThere's far too much focus on the Wonder That Is Truman Capote for a film that insists on covering only one period in his life. Capote is manipulative, egotistical, and constantly condescending. Not an appealing guy, to be sure. And that's fine, but we never really get a sense of what he was about, just how this one event affected him.\nInterminable and overwrought, Capote is not worthy of its many accolades."}

Photographed in stark black and white and infused with a real 1950s feel, George Clooney's sharp homage to one of the greatest journalists America's ever known is utterly captivating and discomfiting.\nEdward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) was one of the biggest stars in CBS News as the host of \"Person to Person\" and \"See It Now.\" When he gets wind of a soldier who's been fired from the Air Force for a tenuous Communist connection, Murrow springs into action, choosing to use Senator Joseph P. McCarthy's own words and actions against him, rather than attacking the man.\nWhat Murrow did was nothing short of astonishing. This was the mid-1950s. The press genuflected to royalty (i.e., politicos) much more than exercised genuine critical analysis of it. What's more, McCarthy's fellow senators did little to prevent the man from running roughshod over the rights of those suspecting of being \"card-carrying Communists.\" With no press to question him and no colleagues to rein him in, McCarthy had carte blanche to root out the evil-doin' Reds from all facets of American life.\nThe stand that Murrow took - putting the reputations of himself, producer Fred Friendly (Clooney), and the CBS network on the line - took an incalculable amount of courage. One misstep by Murrow and his team, and his career would be over. (As it turned out, his undoing of McCarthy was also his own undoing, but that was less his fault than the fault of CBS chief William Paley.) More than fifty years have passed since Murrow won by decision over McCarthy (the senator was censured by his colleagues, which allowed him to remain in the Senate but severely diminished his influence), but the events that take place in this film resonate deeply today. Indeed, it is not unimaginable to see a politician like MCCarthy run amok in a avaricious grab for power and prestige. The passage of time, however, allows us to reflect perhaps a bit more objectively, to examine the fight for the civil rights of every man, woman, and child in the United States. How far have we come in the ensuing half-century? Who are the Murrows of today? Strathairn is nothing short of remarkable. He's not an especially large man, but he has such gravitas in this film that he seems to fill the screen even when he's merely sitting in the background. He is a man of many faces and expressions, and every one of them seems to ring perfectly true. Strathairn has knocked around Hollywood for more than a quarter century, earning scores of accolades from his peers and the media, but he's never been a leading man in a such a widely praised film. Indeed, he's the kind of actor who disappears into roles, who is a superb character actor, adding color and depth to every role he touches. He's been nominated for an Academy award at this writing, and he stands a good chance at bringing home the statuette. It's long overdue.\nStrathairn is ably supported by a well-picked cast, including Robert Downey Jr. in his fortieth comeback, Frank Langella as Paley, and Clooney as producer Friendly. Even more beneficial, though, is the look and feel of the movie, and the near-flawless direction by Clooney. Clooney wisely stuck to the main tet-a-tet between Murrow and McCarthy, rather than building up Murrow as a character first; indeed, there's little else in the movie besides the row with McCarthy. For one thing, we learn virtually nothing about the personal lives of Friendly and Murrow. And that omission works very well within the structure of this film.\nGood Night, and Good Luck is a mesmerizing glimpse at how the power of the press can be used to uphold the rights of man, and a chilling snapshot at what can happen if ego and authority go unchecked."}

Terry soon turns to drink and the friendly comforts of her neighbor, ex-baseball great Denny Davies (Kevin Costner).\nWhat should have been a touching treatise on Why Families Are Important instead de-evolves into a competition to see who can be the most pathetic, the most lecherous, the most indolent character. Chief among these transgressors is Terry herself, a woman with few (if any) redeeming values - although we're frequently reminded that she \"didn't used to be like this.\" \"Redeeming\" is a good word here, because throughout the movie you keep expecting Terry to find redemption, that one day she'll wake up, put a drink down, and declare her love for her daughters, who are suffering from her verbal abuse. That she'll suddenly Get It and realize how wrong she's been. As the movie progresses, though, you keep hoping that doesn't happen, because then the only choice would be a sudden denouement, which might be even worse than her abuse.\nEveryone who's close to Terry has to put up with her outrageous behavior. Emily is a devoted dancer, but Terry refuses to support her, opting instead to squash Emily's dreams. Andy wants to eschew college and get a job, but instead of working with her on that Terry chooses to demean her, especially after she gets a job working at the same radio station Denny does. Even Denny's not immune to her wrath. And none of it makes much sense. Sure, her husband left her. And sure, that'd drive anyone to drink. But does it really have to mean the continued abused of one's family? What really puzzles me about it, though, is that the movie veered sharply from alleged poignancy to ... well, broad comedy. And the shifts weren't subtle, either. Were we supposed to laugh at Terry, or with her? Should we have felt sympathy for an incorrigible boor? Allen is a great actress, and this would seem to be a fine, plum role for her, but I don't think she performed to the best of her abilities. Faring better was pretty much everyone else in the cast, especially Christensen and Costner. Yes, Kevin Costner. He's really quite likable as a supporting player nowadays."}

Steven Spielberg's narrative is never complacent, and it never seems to take the easy way out, choosing not to portray either side as completely good or bad.\nTold from the viewpoint of Avner (Eric Bana, who looks like a younger Liam Neeson), a man charged by Israel to avenge the deaths of the athletes - no matter what the cost. Avner is given a small group of men with which to carry out his task: Kill all 11 members of the terrorist group Black September.\nAlthough not quite as evocative or provocative (to me) as Spielberg's earlier Schindler's List, Munich is compelling nonfiction, crisply moving Avner and his crew from target to target and juxtaposing his thirst for revenge with his thoughts of his family, including his newborn daughter. Spielberg does a good job, too, of compelling the viewer to care about Avner, even while the latter mows down bad men using guns and bombs and other toys.\nThe movie is unsettling, probably much more so if you remember the events of the 1972 Olympics, which I do not. In fact, considering I am not Jewish and do not remember those events, this movie still unnerved me quite a bit. One of the recurring themes is the old \"eye for an eye\" mantra that pops up in any revenge tale. Which is preferred - sinking to the level of our enemies, or rising above it? It's not a question that's easily answered.\nBana is very good as Avner, as is Geoffrey Rush (whom I almost mistook for James Woods) as Avner's liaison with Mossad. There's not a slacker in the bunch, though, no insincere performances, no flat notes.\nThe movie manages to be eerily compelling considering that the outcome is already known - that it, in fact, is still fresh in the minds of many people. Schindler's List had the benefit of arriving more than 50 years after the Holocaust, but with the events in Munich so chronologically close, it would have been easy for the story to lose its footing, to perhaps expose itself as propaganda one way or another. But it doesn't. Although it is pro-Israeli, it is not so to the exclusion of anti-Israeli views; to wit, it is not posited as a clear honorable-revenge story with an easily seen resolution."}

Who did it? Was it her driver and partner-in-outrage? Was it a group of bandits, common in the area? Was it a sinister government operative? Justin Quayle is haunted by the suspicion that his wife had been unfaithful in the months preceding her death. He knows that she had been working with local AIDS activists in Kenya, but after her death he decides to look into the matter a bit more carefully, deciding against leaving the matter in the hands of the British High Commission, for which he works. This laconic gardener tries desperately to understand what his wife was up to, and perhaps who or what caused her imminent demise.\nFiennes is excellent as the quiet Justin, a man who's always been resigned to circumstances - as opposed to Tessa, who's always shaped her own circumstances. Fiennes has a very expressive face, saying so much with so few words, that one does get a fuller sense of what his character was going through - and what he was up against. But in this movie, he takes a backseat to the acting chops of Rachel Weisz - who knew? I mean, who could tell that the strong female sidekick of movies like The Mummy and Constantine, the requisite love interest, would outact Ralph Fiennes, who seems to be a perennial Oscar contender? The gripping story, adapted by Jeffrey Caine from John Le Carre's novel, takes the viewer through several areas of Africa and Europe, spectacularly filmed (particularly the final scenes). Sure, it's a Le Carre novel, but the beautiful cinematography and crisp editing - not to mention the timeliness of the plot, in a world full of conspiracies du jour - make all of the events seem chillingly plausible. The dual themes of love and betrayal are well represented here.\nWeisz was nominated for an Oscar, and the movie also received nods for best adapted screenplay, best original score, and best editing."}

Braddock was a champion light-heavyweight prizefighter. By 1933, though, he'd hit some pretty hard times, along with most of the rest of America. With a broken right hand and a doused spirit, Braddock was so pathetic in the ring that his license to fight was revoked. Unable to pay the bills, Braddock's family has to sell off nearly everything it owns to survive. Braddock can't even get steady work at the docks, as there are precious few jobs each day. In celebration of the indomitable American spirit, Braddock rises from his squalor ashes to challenge the legendary - and murderous - Max Baer for the heavyweight championship at Madison Square Garden.\nBraddock (Russell Crowe) isn't fighting for himself; he's fighting for his wife Mae (Rene Zellweger) and their three kids and the entirety of the impoverished populace of America, people utterly destroyed and broken by the Great Depression. Crowe's Braddock is resilient and courageous, undergoing tremendous suffering to keep his family honorably fed. Crowe himself is amazing, grim-faced, intrepid, humble, and noble. He doesn't see boxing as his right, but as a distinct privilege. Crowe's performance is gutsy, physically demanding, and so evocative that the viewer can feel the punches he's taking - and dishing out.\nStanding behind Braddock and his career choice is his long-suffering wife Mae, although it takes her some time to fully comprehend what Braddock's struggles really mean. Zellweger portrays Mae as no wilting flower, able to love her husband for his boxing and in spite of it. Braddock's other main source of inspiration comes in the person of his trainer/manager, Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti, who was nominated for an Oscar - finally). Gould cares very deeply about the welfare of his fighter, almost to the exclusion of everything else. He proves himself to be a true friend to Braddock, remaining with him through even the toughest times. Giamatti delivers a powerhouse performance as the cagey ringhand; it's hard to imagine a runty looking guy like Giamatti could play such a tough-as-nails character, but he pulls it off, seemingly effortlessly.\nAlthough this is a sports biopic, the movie never veers to the maudlin, never choosing melodrama over sincerity. Moving, compassionate, and beautiful, Cinderella Man is the kind of movie that makes even the manliest men weep openly and certainly leaves an indelible mark on your heart. The violence is brutal - particularly the final fight against Baer - but never gratuitously so, showing that the steady hand of director Ron Howard once again has produced a honest winner. The entire cast is magnificent (and look for Howard's brother Clint in a small role)."}

Marquees of the day would label epics as stupendous, amazing, fantastic, incredible, and so on, and this remake of the 1933 original fits the bill perfectly. Unlike its '33 counterpart, though, it's quite long, clocking in at a mere 187 minutes, but it almost never feels like it, thanks to a relentless barrage of heart-pounding action and heart-stopping suspense. Oh, and romance.\nThe story is your typical girl-meets-giant-ape, giant-ape-tries-to-eat-girl, girl-performs-a-soft-shoe, ape-falls-in-love-with-ape tale, except there's also dinosaurs and giant insects and primitive native tribes that would put the headhunters from Gilligan's Island to shame. Carl Denham (Jack Black, looking quite a bit like Orson Welles), a down-on-his-luck movie director, charts a ship to take him to a distant island: Skull Island. On this mysterious island, Denham plans to shoot his new picture with his leading lady Ann Darrow (the exquisite Naomi Watts) and he-man action star Bruce Baxter (Kyle Chandler); also along for the ride is playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), who's busily writing the script to Denham's movie - on the way to the location, naturally.\nThe movie can be divided into three unequal parts: the voyage to the island (and the prefatory material contained therein), the travails on the island, and the Broadway showing of Kong, back in New York. Much of the movie focuses on the first two parts, especially the time on the island, and this is time well spent. SEE! the natives kidnap Ann and attempt to sacrifice her to Kong! SEE! our heroes attempt to rescue Ann and defeat Kong! SEE! Kong fight not one, not two, but THREE, yes, THREE big ol' dinosaurs! Remember how dinosaurs were depicted in old TV shows like Land of the Lost, or in old movies like The Lost Continent? Now, we can look back at those and marvel at how far we've come - just look at the dinos in Jurassic Park for comparison. But the creatures in King Kong put those in JP to shame, because of the excellent attention to detail and full articulation. No mere man in a monkey suit is Kong, no sir.\nDespite having to work against a blue screen - or air - the blood-and-guts actors of King Kong pull more than their share of the load. Watts is wonderful, her expressive eyes revealing much and little simultaneously. Brody is her equal as the determined scribe, a devil who falls for the lovely Miss Darrow instantly (despite her mistaking someone else for him, poor girl). Both actors have earned their accolades. Black is perfectly hammy as the loquacious, megalomaniacal Denham, who, for all his faults, is of indomitable spirit and verve.\nThere are indeed plenty of scary scenes in King Kong, so the little ones probably should stay at home - or watch it with you when the movie is available on home video, so you can skip some of the more intense parts. Still, it's only violence, and we all love our cartoony violence, don't we?"}

It's about four young London siblings who are sent away from home after the Blitz to live with relatives in the country, and who stumble upon an amazing new world entered through the back of an old closet.\nAnyone who's read C. S. Lewis's books will instantly fall for the elegant way this story is told, from the gorgeous scenery to the wide-eyed innocence and brilliant performances of its mostly young cast. Often with a group of young actors, there's little to distinguish one novice thespian from another, no quirks in personality other than the most rudimentary. But Narnia's Lucy, Susan, Edmund, and Peter are each their own person; and what's more, each grows in his and her own way throughout the movie, however subtly.\nTilda Swinton is riveting as the evil White Witch, dancing a mighty thin line between hammy and calculating. I believe her screen gravitas alone gave encouragement to the young foursome, headed by Georgie Henley as Lucy, the waif who first stumbles upon the then-frozen land of Narnia. But as I said, each of the Pevensie kids distinguishes themselves in the film, no small task when the indomitable Ms. Swinton is aboard.\nThe movie would be little more than a live-action cartoon, though, if not for the fantastic, realistic CGI used for the animals, particularly that of the enigmatic lion Aslan, voiced by the great Liam Neeson. Not to be outdone, Ray Winstone's Mr. Beaver was a true Cockney treat. All of the graphics, though, were quite believable with nary a moment's hesitation. Well done, indeed. The Chronicles of Narnia should garner a Academy Award nomination for visual effects or set design, I would think.\nThe movie is fairly rated PG for some frightening moments, but it's nothing your kids can't handle (probably). If you've read the books, you know there's one particular scene that might be a tad upsetting to the juniors, but rest assured all will be aright one way or another in the end."}

Oh, let's be honest - Pride and Prejudice, this ain't. But in its own idiom, Wedding Crashers is just plain good laugh out loud comedy.\nSo this is what John (Wilson) and Jeremy (Vaughn) do. They get into their nice suits and crash weddings AND receptions. They cozy up to the hot guests, make balloon animals, dance, flirt, and eventually wind up with someone. And the next day or weekend, they do it again. Then one day John falls for his mark, Claire (Rachel McAdams), the daughter of the Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken). Oops; in violation of all of their rules of wedding crashing, the boys spend the weekend with the secretary and his upper-crust family. Claire's engaged to be engaged to Sack, who's thoroughly obnoxious and creepy. You know, just in case you thought she'd have to really choose between him and John, who's, well, Owen Wilson.\nAlso thrown into the mix are Claire's younger sister Gloria, who has the hots for Jeremy - and who may or may not be a virgin; her brother Todd, a bitter, repressed artist; her mom, played by the usually prim Jane Seymour, who has the hots for Jeremy, too; a gramma, and a wise and all knowing butler. It's madcap mayhem, I tell you! Often, this type of chaotic, door-slamming comedy doesn't work in American films, but Wlson and Vaughn are talented enough to pull it off. And it helps that the movie is well written (by Steve Faber and Bob Fisher), with plenty of one liners and running gags.\nSure, it's a tad predictable (gee, do you think true love will win?), but who cares?

Complicated plots are one thing, because sometimes one can just mentally separate the more important story strands from the seemingly inconsequential, but the ones that just aren't too clear do me in.\nSyriana is one of the latter class. I can see the overarching theme, that Big Oil sometimes does nefarious things to innocent people, things that affect peoples around the globe, but some of the threads that added up to that grand theme were a little tough to keep track of. This made watching Syriana not a terribly enjoyable or rewarding experience. You, as viewer, know you're supposed to come away with a sense of disgust and dismay, of self-righteous indignation, but I came away simply relieved it was over.\nGeorge Clooney plays Bob Barnes, a CIA operative who's been to war zones in Beirut and Tehran. He's captured and tortured, he's released, he's sent back, and so on. Then there is an emir with three sons, one of whom has been proactive and feels he deserves the kingdom when his father departs (shades of King Lear?). And then there's an energy analyst (Matt Damon) who's helping one of the sons. Somehow all of these little themes tie in together, but it's tough to see that during the first half or so of the movie.\nHad this been a straightforward spy movie (focusing on Barnes), or even a political thriller (focusing on the emirate and Damon's character), I think the theme would have been better realized. It's not a question of identifying bad guys and good guys, because that's fairly evident; it's that the movie leaps from setting to setting with little to link the disparate scenes.\nClooney, who packed on the pounds for his role, is fantastic, but he's not on screen enough. Damon, on the other hand, is on screen too often; even at 35, he still looks like a high schooler. Imagine someone from your senior class acting as an energy analyst! He looks like he's giving an oral book report. It's not bad acting, it's bad casting. On the other hand, Amanda Peet, as his wife, is very solid in a small role - another actress might have been much less noticeable. And along for the ride is the elegant, yet ancient Christopher Plummer, looking every one of his 86 years.\nHollywood tends to oversex its movies, adding bombs and breasts to boost box office. I hate to say it, but some bombs might have helped considerably here. There's little action in the movie, although what's there is pretty good.

Sometimes his movies are poignant, and sometimes they're slapstick hilarity. This offal, however, never even hints at Allen's writing or directing abilities; indeed, it may as well have been directed by John Badham for all of the flavor and panache it expresses.\nEven though the movie's appeared on many must-see lists as people gear up for the Oscar nominations, Match Point is a travesty of a sham of a mockery of an entertaining film. It's a longwinded load of dung. Nearly every scene is deadeningly dull, and the few that aren't are instead serve as perfect clich\u00e9s.\nJonathan Rhys-Meyers plays Chris, a tennis pro who falls for Chloe, the daughter of a rich British family (the movie's set in London), played by Emily Mortimer. Chris' best pal is Tom (Matthew Goode), Chloe's sister. Rounding out the main quartet is American actress Nola (Scarlett Johansson), who's engaged to Tom. Wouldn't you know it, seconds after meeting Nola - after already being partnered with Chloe - Chris falls for the flaxen-haired lass, who's strong-willed and outspoken where her British counterparts are a little more complacent.\nCan Chris keep his lust a secret from Tom and Chloe? And what of the parents, the richer-than-rich Eleanor (Penelope Wilton) and Alec (Brian Cox)? They dote on Chris, showering him with money and gifts and a job. How could Chris give all of that up to be with Nola? Several things work against the movie aside from the faceless direction and writing. For one thing, Chris is utterly unappealing. A protagonist certainly does not need to be likable, but there must be something about him or her that makes the audience want to see what happens to him or her. The appalling acting by Rhys-Meyers doesn't help matters at all; he's lifeless, utterly devoid of emotion. He can't even seem to conjure enough strength to show a good facial expression. He's a blank, a cipher no one wants to learn more about. Allen didn't write the character well at all, to make matters worse. It's a little too easy to figure out Chris' intentions, but his motivations are sometimes a mystery. And for goodness' sake, someone give this boy a spine transplant! How can a lead character be so terminally wishy washy? Of the supporting cast, only Johansson and Cox emerge unscathed. Cox is a veteran actor and could probably have played this role in his sleep, and Johansson is a rising star, capable of fantastic range. She was given very little to work with (her character doesn't really possess any unique traits), and it showed.\nThe pacing is mind numbing. I cannot tell you how many times I checked my watch to see how much time remained in the movie. It's plodding and aimless, certain to bore even the most rabid Merchant-Ivory fan, even though those masters had nothing to do with this one. Instead, we're given the vagrant stepchild of a true master American filmmaker. Allen would have been much better off removing his name from the credits for the pseudonymous Alan Smithee. Another annoying debit: Despite the title, tennis takes place for maybe three scenes.\nIf you're not a fanatic of tedious, overwrought melodramas, please adjust this rating down at least half a star."}

Jane Smith (Angelina Jolie) is, too. They work for different companies, and neither one knows the other's true occupation. Until they're hired to kill each other. *cue suspense music*\nThanks to the excellent chemistry between Pitt and Jolie and some riveting action scenes, the movie manages to lift itself above most others in the genre. That is to say, it's not just another dumb shoot-em-up, although not as brainy as, for example, The Bourne Identity. The mutual discovery that their spouse is a hit man doesn't occur until a good half hour into the film, but once it does, you're treated to a series of fast-paced scenes in the tradition of The War of the Roses, including a decimation of the couple's home. The trouble is that I can't give you too much of the plot without telling you the twists, because there aren't that many to begin with. But as long as you concentrate on the combined hotness of the starring duo - so smoldering that sparks flew off-set as well - you'll be fine. Don't let the story distract you!\nDoug Liman, who gave us such instant classics as Swingers, Go, and The Bourne Identity, keeps things moving pretty quickly, although a peek at the goofs page on IMDb will show that enough errors were made to make one question the editing. Still, the action scenes pack quite a wallop, particularly the close hand-to-hand combat between the Smiths in their house. \nThe story varies for the most part from implausible to improbable, as is often the case with action films. But Pitt and Jolie both look right for their respective parts, including handling firearms and other weapons. What impressed me is that neither character seemed particularly moralistic about their line of work. For example, no \"oh, we kill only bad guys!\" junk - they kill whomever, whenever, wherever. Particularly amusing is the scene in which they reveal to each other how many kills they've had.\nVince Vaughn is on hand as Eddie, who works with John, and even though his role is very small, he manages to walk off with every scene he's in. That's because Jolie and Pitt wisely underplay their roles, leaving the fireworks to take center stage. Oh, and their obvious good looks, too."}

His Tony Manero isn't a perfectly nice Brooklyn kid, but he's also not a rotten jerk. He's 19, has a job that he enjoys (selling paint at a hardware store), and at night he's the king of the dance floor at the height of the disco age.\nThe movie is very dated - as most movies that rely on topical music score and fashion must be - but the theme runs true. Tony dances to build his own self-esteem, since he gets little in the way of positive enforcement from a family that dotes upon his older brother, a priest. He hangs with his arrested-development pals, drinking and dancing and carousing and fighting.\nTravolta is fantastic as Tony; he's not as loud and arrogant as his friends, but he's clearly their leader. He's not terribly bright, but he's smart enough to know his limitations. He's a little thoughtful, but not too reflective, choosing to live in the present. Until, that is, he meets the slightly older Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney).\nIt's easy to see why audiences flocked to this one, with its strong soundtrack (all Bee Gees, all the time) and electric atmosphere. The movie's uncharacteristically well directed by John Badham, and Travolta's supporting cast is appropriate, not slipping into caricatures."}

Whimsical and highly imaginative, Tim Burton's latest melange of creativity is wholesome without being entirely pure, although the edge of the original film (and Roald Dahl's story) is somewhat blunted.\nWonka's world-famous candy factory has been closed to the public - anyone, really - for decades, although candy still emerges each morning, neatly packed and ready to ship. Then one day, Wonka himself announces he has placed Golden Tickets in five Wonka Bars distributed throughout the globe. The children who find the five tickets are thereupon invited to a Grand Tour of the mysterious factory, and one of the kids will get a Veddy Special Prize at the end.\nThe kids are the same as in the first film: snotty spoiled brat Veruca Salt, overachiever Violet Beauregarde, glutton Augustus Gloop, hostile Mike Teavee, and waiflike Charlie Bucket. Throughout the tour, each exposes his or her own self as a greedy, conniving fiend - except, of course, for poor (literally) Charlie, who's accompanied by his superold grandpa (David Kelly, who's fantastic).\nThe sets are stunning, from the chocolate river to the squirrels' QC lab, and this allows one to forget how annoying Depp's Wonka is. He's intentionally unique, which is sort of a euphemism for \"we want him to be as strange as possible, the better to distance him from the people from the outside world.\" Some have said that Depp was consciously aping Michael Jackson in his mannerisms, but I don't really see it. Heck, his Wonka doesn't even like kids, and he detests any kind of familial arrangement. I admire Depp for trying to make the role his own (and thus differentiating his work from that of Gene Wilder), but his Wonka was a little too loopy for me - it was tough to get a handle on him. And when you did think you knew what he was about, he'd say something that disproved that; sometimes that seemed to be a heavyhanded approach, a way to cynically manipulate the audience. If it was supposed to keep us on our toes, it failed, because I got tired of the character's contrarian attitude.\nA real treat, added just for the movie, is Wonka's father, played by the estimable Christopher Lee. The senior Wonka is a dentist (of course he is) who has not seen his only son since the latter left home to become a chocolatier. Which brings up an interesting question. How come Dr. Wonka looks older when he reunites with Willy than when they're together in flashbacks... but Willy doesn't? In fact, Willy Wonka looks pretty young - Lee looks more like his grandfather. Depp still has quite the boyish look about him; he appears to be in his late twenties, possible midthirties.\nI also enjoyed the Oompa Loompas, played by exactly one guy - Deep Roy. Roy repeated the movements of the Oompa Loompahs hundreds of times, and then he was digitally repeated over and over again, creating the illusion that he was many instead of one. A fine, fun job.\nHighmore is a truly great find; he played Peter in Finding Neverland, also starring Depp. Depp recommended Highmore to Tim Burton for the role of the angelic Charlie, and it turned out to be a most excellent recommendation. Charlie is alternately sage and blissfully naive, wise beyond his few years but still innocent at heart.\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory isn't as meanspirited as its predecessor, but it does have better scenery and fine performances - even the kids, so horribly bratty in the original, are merely rotten in this one. Burton proves again he has the visual part of directing down pat, although sometimes the heart eludes him."}

With the aid of a trusty, nosy juror (Dennis Quaid), she solves the crime. The film is set in Washington, D.C., so you know there are machinations and duplicity and such, so it's really a question of whether Cher and company can make the twists and turns seem plausible. (Hint: Not especially.) Stuck in a high-pressure, dead-end job as public defender, Kathleen Riley is handed a thankless assignment - defend a homeless man accused of killing a young woman. Physical evidence is on the side of the prosecutor, but her client insists he's innocent. A concerned juror decides to help her out, illegally. What follows in an intricate web of deceit and such that's a basic carbon copy of most legal thrillers.\nCher's not bad, although she would fare far better the following year with Moonstruck. There is one scene in which she's carjacked (early in the film, nonincidental to the plot) and cries out a very stilted and unbelievable EEK! Seriously, it sounded like a pretend-yell, as in \"Eek, help, I'm being attacked by a killer beagle!\" Even so, Cher was appealing and acceptable in the lead role.\nDennis Quaid was good as well, although his character wasn't exactly deep. First of all, I can't imagine anyone making a concerted effort to aid a lawyer in a case in which he or she is a juror - unless the juror has a vested interest in doing so. Second, the chemistry between Quaid and Cher was barely palpable - they looked like they'd be more comfortable playing siblings. Third, Quaid's character manages to show up at all the right times, sometimes incredibly so. Made it all that much tougher to swallow.\nRounding out the notables in the cast are Joe Mantegna as the prosecutor and John Mahoney in a great role as the presiding judge.\nSuspect would have been a winner if the writing had been a little tighter. I think movies in which there's a strong female lead who's about to nab the bad guys but OH NO they're meaner and tougher and she goes to pieces. You know what I mean? You rarely see female leads that are strong emotionally, intellectually, and physically."}

Of course, it's ironic that they take a shortcut, since cutting is indeed involved. They spend the night camped in the woods and are interrupted by a strange pickup truck whose lights shine directly on them. Muahahaha. The next morning, the fan belt to one of their cars is broken, and they find a dumping ground of dead critters, and...\nOh, let's face it. You're never gonna watch this for the horror, are you? Maybe you'll root for Paris Hilton to die or you'll watch it for Elisha Cuthbert, who's pretty good. If these are your noble goals, you probably won't be disappointed. The rest of the cast is completely forgettable; in fact, aside from Hilton, you don't openly wish any of them would die, as you might in better horror films.\nOnly some of the action takes place in the actual House of Wax; the rest is in the other buildings of an apparent ghost town - made of WAX! Dun dun dun! Which means ample opportunities for our screwy gang to get eviscerated and flayed and such. Much fun. There's a movie theater and a gas station and houses, all filled with implements of destruction.\nHilton is believably vapid and lifeless as, in an example of brave casting, The Blonde Slut. Since she spends much of her screen time smooching with her boyfriend, there aren't many chances for her to show off her rapier wit and keen intellect. Cuthbert is a fine heroine, and she shows just enough skin to make the movie slightly interesting. At least you don't root for her to die, always a plus for your protagonist.\nThere aren't too many genuine scares, but there are just enough to bring this above a true BOMB rating.

True, there's plenty of blood and guts and the added twist of semisentient zombies, but within the recent spate of living dead movies, you might be better off with 28 Days Later.\nSeems the zombies have spread all over the world, leading the comparatively few surviving humans to hole up in a walled, heavily fortified city, Most of its denizens struggle on the streets or in small shelters, in utter squalor, many suffering from horrible, disfiguring diseases. A select few, however, spend their lives in happy comfort in a giant skyscraper presided over by Kaufman (Dennis Hopper), who offers the elite all the protection possible to keep the zombies off their trail.\nThe city is bordered on three sides by water, and the zombies have no idea how to cross it. But supplies aren't infinite within the city, so Kaufman sends out recon bands, headed by Riley (Simon Baker) that infiltrate the neighboring (ghost) towns at night. Why night, you ask? Because then they can shoot off fireworks, which apparently mesmerizes the crap out of the mindless sacks of meat.\nCompleting the trifecta of Important Characters is Cholo (John Leguizamo), a recon soldier who also delivers supplies to Kaufman personally. When Kaufman rebuffs Cholo's request for residence in the Big Ol' Skyscraper of Cool, Cholo steals the former's multiterrain, super-tricked-out ubervehicle, called Dead Reckoning, threatening an attack on the tower if his monetary demands aren't met. Kaufman sends Riley, and there's your plot. Oh, and there's zombies all over the place.\nIt's disappointing that Hopper wasn't given a more maniacal role, like Deacon in Waterworld, or even Frank Booth in Blue Velvet. He was evil, sure, but almost in a Donald Trump way, far too bland given the irascible actor involved. But at least he doesn't seem completely out of place, like Baker. The role might have worked with an actor who had a bit more panache, something of substance to offer. Instead, Riley seemed almost like a cardboard leader, a meaningless prop. By contrast, Leguizamo (predictably) walks off with every scene he's in, lighting up the screen even in the dark of night.\nWe do learn a few things about the zombies, but there aren't many twists and turns to the plot at all; the result is a cheap knockoff of most other postapocalyptic-nightmare movies, such as (come to think of it) Waterworld. Or The Road Warrior. Or even Tank Girl.\nRomero's movie isn't terrible, necessarily, but it's a far cry from his previous zombie outings and therefore a bit of a letdown."}

I enjoyed Baron Munchausen and The Fisher King. Even when his movies haven't been terribly good (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas), they were interesting, to say the least.\nI really can't say for the unfortunate Brothers Grimm, a movie that simply has an identity crisis. Does it want to be a purveyor of broad (Pythonesque) comedy? Or subtle, sophisticated wit? Or maybe a melodrama, or a romance? I was never sure how to take the movie. And that's fine if the movie in question can pull off being in several genres at once, as with some of Gilliam's earlier works, but that's really not the case here.\nJacob and Will Grimm (Heath Ledger and Matt Damon) are con artists in the 18th century; they take advantage of local legends and fairy tales, swooping in to save the day and make a boatload of money in French-occupied Germany. But then their scam is discovered by the French, in the person of General Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce) who says he'll spare the lads' lives if they rid a village of a REAL problem, the disappearance of several young girls.\nBut the village's forest, it turns out, really IS enchanted, and events that closely resemble folk tales (including the Gingerbread Man, Hansel and Gretel, and Little Red Riding Hood) unfold around the hapless con artists. They can't flee, because the French army wants to capture and torture them, and of course there's a love interest (Lena Headey) to keep them around.\nGilliam's sets are, as always, quite inventive and fun to watch, but it appears he forgot about such nuances as plot advancement and plausibility. The Brothers seem about as intelligent as the Duke boys, if you catch my drift, except without any of the gregarious appeal. This is at least partly due to the ambiguity of the lead characters - are they supposed to be lovable buffoons, hoisted by their own petards, or all-around jerks only in it for themselves? Ledger and Damon seem to be miscast, as neither supplies the gravitas that the movie sorely needed. It's like watching a buddy cop film while heavily sedated; at nearly two hours, the movie plods along as if terrified of a denouement, even though the ending (and all secrets contained therein) were painfully obvious after the first hour).\nI think it would have been fun to see this movie as more of a Holy Grail homage, complete with toothless old hags declaring curses and such. But somewhere between that 1975 opus and this dreadful, toothless waste, Gilliam lost his sense of humor."}

Her case is assigned to the Secret Service's Dignitary Protection group, which must decide whether her claims are accurate - or if she's in on the conspiracy herself.\nSydney Pollack's political thriller is a taut, knowing mystery up to the very end, buoyed in no small part by electrifying performances by Kidman and Sean Penn (as Agent Keller), clearly at the top of their game. And unlike other action thrillers, the plot does hold up to close scrutiny.\nKidman, raised an Aussie, is completely believable as the African interpreter from the (fictional) country of Matobo; her accent never seems to slip even a whit. Her Silvia Broom is cool as ice, belying the chaos in her personal and professional life. By contrast, Penn's Keller wears his heart on his sleeve, still shellshocked from the sudden death of his wife just a few weeks earlier.\nKeller doesn't believe Silvia at first, especially when she admits she's no big fan of Zuwanie, her country's president, but it's quickly obvious that someone means to do the leader harm, and Keller can't help but try to look beneath the calm surface of Silvia's tortured soul.\nThe movie is well paced, with few letups and few obvious scenes; it's not wholly unpredictable, but even when things aren't what they seem, they're not what they seem. You know what I mean? \"Oh ho!\" you say. \"This is one of those movies in which people doublecross each other, right? So this person will do THIS...\" And then it turns out you guessed wrong. It's that kind of movie.\nInterestingly enough, part of the movie was filmed in the actual United Nations. I'm all for the occasional movie being filmed in heretofore forbidden places, as long as the product is worthy of the honor (I seem to recall Moscow's Red Square being the location for Red Heat, sadly), and this one really meets that high standard.\nOf course, if you've watched a lot of movies, it's quite possible you'll figure out some of the ending before you reach it, but the fun is in getting there. This is among the finest work for Penn, Kidman, and Pollack, a twisty political-intrigue movie you can really sink your teeth into. It's a full notch above most of its ilk (like, say, Enemy of the State), at the same level of such seventies thrillers as The French Connection and The Parallax View."}

That's about all it has going for it, really; the schtick of having a corpse narrate the movie (Which would be done quite a bit better a few years later by Sunset Blvd.) isn't well executed, anyway.\nLaura Van Ee (Mary Lamont) is a nervous, tension-ridden ex-dancer who thinks she's imprisoned in her room by her husband Ward and her father in law Dr. Josef (George Zucco). She's mad, mad I tell you! Since it's her corpse that narrates, I think we can assume we know what happens to Mrs. Van Ee right from the get-go.\nWhy is she so anxious? She's not sure - no one is - but everyone suspects it all has something to do with her past, and something to do with a handkerchief. Enter Bela Lugosi and a midget - no, wait, Professor Leonide and his faithful companion, Indigo. And a wisecracking, tough-guy reporter (Douglas Fowley) and his dim-bulb dame (Joyce Compton).

As they progress, they're getting darker and more adult, much like Harry Potter himself. In the beginning, they felt more like kids' movies that adults could enjoy, and now the tables have been turned a bit.\nThis fourth movie covers Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts. The Goblet of the title is a magical urn that spits out the names of three contestants for that year's Triwizards Tournament. Ah, but there's a fourth name belched by the goblet, and to no viewer's surprise, it belongs to Young Mr. Potter.\nNo one knows how Harry's name made its way into the Goblet, especially since there's a curse on it that prevents anyone under 17 from submitting a name, and Harry insists he didn't even try. But rules is rules, and Harry's the fourth contestant. The quartet must face three challenges, including dragons, merpeople, and a labyrinth. We know, of course, that Harry will make it through all of these tasks relatively intact, since his further exploits (books five and six) have already been published. But how does he do it? What new characters will attempt to foil him, and what new friends will he make? Hogwarts is the host school for the tournament, and so two other schools will be spending the year with the Hogwarts students - a bevy of French lasses and a squadron of strapping central European lads. It is from these two schools, plus one from Hogwarts and Harry himself, that the four contestants are selected by the Goblet.\nBut perhaps Harry's biggest challenge is a rather mundane one - finding a date to the Yule Ball. Perhaps the most endearing quality of Rowling's books (and the movies) is that Harry, underneath it all, is really just another teenager. He's alternately whiny, paranoid, unhappy, and joyful. And now he and his chums have been told they'll all be taking dance lessons so they can look good on the floor later that year.\nOf course, adding to the fun is the latest Defense against the Dark Arts teacher, Alastor \"Mad Eye\" Moody (Brendan Gleeson), who has - as you might guess - one working eye and a sort of robotic eye that has a telescopic lens. And at least one fake leg. He kind of looks like the love child of C-3PO and the Skipper from Gilligan's Island. The Dark Arts teacher is traditionally a one-year wonder - something always happens - so the mystery is what'll happen to Moody, not if it'll happen at all.\nRowling's world is so well defined that new characters can be introduced in the books but mentioned only fleetingly in the movies - and we're none the worse for it. For example, Madame Maxime, a half-giantess who's the headmistress of the French school, falls for (surprise!) Hagrid, the half-giant. Ah, true love. We don't see much of them, but when we do see Madame Maxime her appearances aren't incongruous; they, in fact, help further the plot.\nSince the movies are getting darker (tough times ahead!), we see less and less of the cute touches that inhabited the first two films, such as buying books in Diagon Alley, boarding the train to Hogwarts, seeing Hagrid greeting the first year students, and so forth. But in its place, we get a LOT of fantastic effects, such as Harry outracing and outmaneuvering a flying dragon - on his broom, of course; Harry speaking with Sirius via the Gryffindor fire, and the Quidditch World Cup. These scenes aren't just wowie scenes done to shock and amaze the audience; they feel perfectly plausible and logical, not gratuitous.\nMike Newell is the director this time around (the third director in the series), and the first Briton to helm one of the movies. He's really adept at staging action scenes without distracting the audience with special effects - which is not to say the effects aren't grand, just that they're not the only thing the movie has going for it.\nEveryone seems to be aging with their roles rather well (although Maggie Smith's looking longer in the tooth than usual, perhaps, and Michael Gambon's Dumbledore is much more energetic than Richard Harris' was), and I was pleased to see that there wasn't too much attention paid to the romantic angles of the story (particularly regarding the ball). I was further pleased to see the friendship of Hermione, Ron, and Harry being reevaluated. Readers of the series know that the interrelationships of these three friends will change drastically in due time, and it's good to see just a hint of it here (rather than dwelling on it to the point of detracting from the rest of the story).\nI would not recommend that kids under a certain age watch this movie. It is the first in the series to be rated PG-13 (fitting, since Harry is now 14), and its dark themes - including children in peril, death, serious injury - will probably be too much for the younger set who liked the first two films in the series.\nAll in all, I thought Goblet was the best of the bunch so far. Often, by the time a there's a fourth in a movie series, the characters are so well worn that one can rather easily predict what's going to happen to them. But this isn't the case here, and that might be at least partly due to the changing directors (and tone). We're familiar with Harry and his friends, and we root for them, but they never become so bland - or, to the other extreme, wacky for the sake of being wacky - that they become tiresome, not by a long shot."}

It's a little overlong, which is weird since it's really only about 75 minutes in length, but what I mean is that there's plenty of filler, a lot of extended shots for no apparent reason. Still, the atmosphere is pretty creepy, even if the acting is thoroughly wooden.\nIt's set in the present time, which would be early 1960s, back when the hippies were still in only one area of the country, where men were men and women were subservient to them. You get the picture. Big cars, short haircuts, conservative values. Everyone has this hokey golly gosh accent. The main characters are med students who are also pledging a fraternity; in the frat angle to the plot, they're each given some goofy \"assignment\" at the wild-n-crazy Bacchnalian barbecue. These kids wouldn't know wild and crazy if Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd, circa 1975, jumped on them and sang \"King Tut\" till their vocal cords began to bleed. I mean, one of the assignments is that one guy - who apparently likes his liquor, if you know what I mean - isn't allowed to touch ANY liquid for an entire day - and then he's allowed to gorge. WOW! What a task! Can he survive? Sure, the first part's tough, but then you get to drink all you want. This is not a tough assignment.\nThe crux of the plot, though, concerns one Lewis P. Moffatt, a balding collegian who apparently has no fear. He even assists the professor in an autopsy, while his chums vomit! Whee! He's tough as nails, this one. So he, naturally, gets the frat assignment of a lifetime. But alas, I can't tell you about it here, since it's integral to the ending AND happens withing ten minutes of said ending.\nAs with many of the dollar DVDs I've found, most of the actors (he said, unconvincingly) in this movie never appeared in anything again. I can't imagine why. Their characterizations aren't too deep, anyway - there's even a couple that exists solely because they're fat as hell and proud of it. (There's even a gratuitous beauty pageant in which the chunky boyfriend - a judge - votes for his hefty girlfriend and then spends precious plot minutes explaining why. Whee!

Turns out Ford's a researcher for the Guide of the title, and he's able to rescue Arthur from Earth before our fair planet is obliterated to make way for a bypass.\nWhy bother with more plot details than that, really? That's all you need to know. Arthur is Everyman, and everyone else is incredibly odd. But not so odd that your brain's not proportionally entertained. And entertained you will be! Check out some of the fun stuff the future apparently holds. There'll be these tiny fish that can translate any language after you put them in your ear. Fantastic! And then there's another device that detects what you want to eat by analyzing your mind.\nNow, I've read all of the books, and I've seen the miniseries, and I've even listened to the old radio play (on tape, remember those?). Yes, there are some differences - they couldn't cram everything from the first book into one movie - including the addition of a character. But fret not, Douglas Adams himself made these changes, and they feel rather seamless. So that's a huge plus. And if you did see the miniseries back in the day, you might recall how woefully low-budget the effects were. Ah, this time around the Infinite Improbabilty Drive looks VERY improbable, indeed.\nThe movie manages somehow to capture the spirit of the books, which is no small feat when you consider how absurd the original plot really was. Plus, there's that omnipresent dry British wit, but somehow THAT comes across as well.\nThe entire cast is excellent, but I particularly loved Alan Rickman as the voice of Marvin the Paranoid Android. Perfect, absolutely as I'd imagined him to be. \"Life... don't talk to me about life,\" moans Marvin. It's also fun to watch Mos Def as Ford, Sam Rockwell as Zaphod, and the ethereal Zooey Deschanel as Trillian, with her big eyes and flighty charm. No, really, they were all simply smashing. As you can see, it's the kind of movie that makes you talk all Englandian."}

Some of the people are good, hardworking souls just trying to scrape by, and others are bad people bent on destruction and menacing. By the end, though, some of the good people have done bad things, and some of the bad people have done good things. And they all grew as people as a result.\nThis wasn't an easy movie to get through. To begin with, nearly every character is despicable in his or her own way. Not so much that one can easily classify them as Bad, no - it's more as if each was being presented as a Good person with Flaws. The downside to that, though, is that it makes rooting for any of the characters is nearly impossible.\nAnother problem is the writing. Everything is film with such a heavy, hamfisted attitude! Person A has something happen to them, so of COURSE they're going to emerge as a better person as a result. I mean, I'm glad that things don't always turn out like rainbows and unicorns and happy crap like that for our brave characters, but does their redemption (or fall from grace) have to happen so obviously? It's as if the viewer has been hit over the head with a frying pan - BAM! THIS PERSON DID A BAD THING. THEY ARE NOW NOT AS GOOD AS YOU THOUGHT. And then BAM! you get hit again, because the same knucklehead did something else.\nI didn't like anybody, and I had a strong sense that if I ran into any of them, anywhere, they sure as heck wouldn't like me, either. What a bunch of miserable, whiny, self-obsessed, self-absorbed twits these people are. Convinced they are right, they haphazardly stomp about the movie, glaring menacingly at people who are different from them, which naturally is supposed to teach us, the unwashed audience, that Different Is Good, and these people Just Don't Get It (Yet).\nPaul Haggis wrote, directed, coproduced, and wrote some of the music for the movie. Interestingly enough, the Scottish dish haggis smells just as bad as this movie. What should have been melodramatic was instead uproariously funny; it helps when you've actively decided to dislike the characters. I wished for their deaths, and I bet some of you will, too.\nDon Cheadle continues to prove he's a great actor, and Ludicrous was surprisingly convincing, walking away with most of his scenes. But the rest of the gang was dull and trite, doing little with the admittedly awful material with which they had to work. But don't feel too bad for them, folks, because at least they didn't have to listen to the soundtrack, which seemed to consist of one long Enya-like tribute. I suspect it was actually several songs, but it seemed like a continuous stream of overemoting - and inappropriately, at that. You know how in horror films there's this music that'll play that lets the audience know Something Bad Is Gonna Happen? That's what the music here was, only it never stopped."}

I've read several of the books, and they always seem almost made for action movies, complete with larger-than-life (but one-dimensional) characters and wild, exotic locales. So I skipped watching this in the theater, and I now strongly regret that decision.\nThe basic plot is that Dirk Pitt, Director of Special Projects for the National Underwater and Marine Agency, thinks an old Civil War-era ironclad ship has somehow found its way to a river in Africa. At the same time, a luscious doctor with the World Health Organization discovers there's been a viral outbreak in the same general area in Africa. Might these two meet up at some point during the movie? Pitt (Matthew McConaughey) is part Superman, part daredevil, part Lothario, part Jacques Cousteau, and part Albert Einstein. Naturally, such a person would never exist in real life, but the character is so likable - a devilish rogue, if you will - on paper that one forgives the transparency of his personality. He's adept at solving mysteries large and small, but he can't be without his trusty sidekick Al Giordino (Steve Zahn). Dirk and Al head to Mali, off the southwestern coast of Africa, because they think the old ironclad Texas somehow landed there; Dirk's evidence is a single gold coin supposedly commissioned by Jefferson Davis. The two are joined by Dr. Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz), the WHO doctor who is trying to trace the source of a deadly virus.\nI won't bore you with the plot, but it's important to note that unlike the recent James Bond movies, the settings do not exist as simple travelogues (as in, \"Wow, look! We're in Finland! Now we're in Australia! Now we're in Swaziland!\" and so forth); instead, everything does make perfect logical sense. Also, the storyline isn't so complicated as to be confusing; sometimes action movies overplot themselves to distract the viewer from its incoherence. The photography is fantastic, and even simple acts like Stuff Blowing Up look wonderful.\nIt's not easy to read the books and picture Al Giordino as a pale, skinny guy instead of a stocky Italian, but Zahn was quite believable in the role. One might have figured that talent would take a back seat to whimsical casting on the order of stereotypical, stock characterizations. Uh-uh, one would be wrong. Zahn is so perfectly cast, he actually manages to walk off with scenes, no mean feat considering the special effects and the natural charisma of McConaughey. In the books, Al is just the kind of pal you want to be with in a tight situation, but he can also toss off the random bon mot. Zahn was able to do that and much more, a pleasant surprise.\nPerhaps most importantly, McConaughey and Zahn had perfect chemistry together, and I could be convinced that they truly were lifelong buddies. Even better, both played off Cruz pretty well, too. I had a little trouble buying her as a smart doctor, but I can suspend my disbelief a little. It's not as if she were Denise Richards in that James Bond movie I can't remember because it wasn't very good.\nOften, action movies have logical holes you could drive a Hummer through, moments in which you actually stop and think, \"Wait, that can't happen... you cannot use snakes to pick a lock,\" or something similar. If a movie makes you stop and think, and it's not a thinking-man's movie, then it's failed somehow. Bombs are good, but let's make 'em plausible bombs! At any rate, Sahara never does this. Everything ties in, but not obviously so. Sure, you know Eva and Dirk will meet cute and wind up together, but anyone reading any of the Dirk Pitt books knows this. He always gets the girl. And then the next book, he gets another. He's so cool.\nSo, to sum up: Sahara is in the grand tradition of adventure movies like Raiders of the Last Ark, but unlike most pretenders to the Indiana Jones throne it's frantically entertaining."}

Naturally, the big bad tape that caused so much trouble the first time around follows her up there, as she fortuitously discovers while in the employ of the local newspaper.\nThe Ring Two was directed by Hideo Nakata, who directed the Japanese original (and its own sequel), and under his direction the movie has only two speeds - deadeningly slow, whereupon the viewer feels as apprehensive as the movie's heroine, and screamingly, bracingly quick. This pacing is a huge asset to what's otherwise a slightly better-than-mediocre film. A good recent comparable film is Skeleton Key, which also features a smart, sexy young blonde heroine (Kate Hudson), although there's no underlying theme of child endangerment.\nWatts is fantastic, but the true shining light of the film is Dorfman, who at twelve years old appears to have all the poise and none of the hubris of most adult actors. He and Watts interact very well together; that they are mother and son is eminently believable, and their chemistry lent plenty of gravitas to the movie. The real question is whether Dorfman can successfully make the transition into adult roles, but luckily that decision is still a few years off.\nStill, despite the fine work turned in by Watts and Dorfman (and, to a lesser extent, Sissy Spacek), there were enough \"What the heck?\" moments to give one pause. Most of them are integral to the plot, so I won't discuss them here, but general one sticks out: Even though Rachel states over and over that everything she does is for her son, she makes some questionable mothering decisions. There are also steps she takes that cause one to wonder why she hadn't taken them earlier in the film, when it would make more sense to.\nEven so, the movie never seems to deal in horror clich\u00e9s, such as various unnecessary characters going into dark basements or attics. It also doesn't merely replay the events of the original film, a cop out many horror sequels seem to use (or, in the case of the worst of the lot, a mere rethinking of ways for youngsters to die). Rachel and Aidan are flawed, but with depth; Rachel in particular is well developed because she's able to convey the sense of protecting her child, even to the point of considering the ultimate sacrifice to save his skin.\nI look forward to seeing more Hideo Nakata movies - he appears to have three coming out next year."}

I'll say it - Hide and Suck.", "content": "Hide and Seek is the kind of movie that desperately wants to be a taut psychological thriller but winds up spelling out its ending about twenty minutes too early. Robert De Niro plays a New York psychologist whose wife (the seldom-seen Kate Capshaw) kills herself by slitting her wrists in a bathtub, thus traumatizing the couple's young daughter Emily (Dakota Fanning). In an attempt to start over, the good doc David bundles up Emily and takes them to upstate New York for some R&R.\nDavid tries to find new friends for Emily in the secluded, picturesquely rustic community and settles on Elizabeth (Elisabeth Shue) and her daughter (or niece, I'm not sure which, but it's not important, since we see the girl in only a couple of scenes). But it's for naught, as Emily apparently already has a new, albeit imaginary friend named Charlie. \"He's fun,\" she says monotonically. \"Fun like mommy.\" David and Emily have moved into a large frame house in the proverbial middle of nowhere, the latter location noted on screen by the real estate agent guy. But lo and behold, they do have close neighbors: Laura and Steven, who may or may not have their own super secrets. Just so you know our main characters don't have the skeletons-in-the-closet market cornered.\nDavid tries to understand his daughter's reason for having this new friend, and his doc pal Katherine (Famke Janssen) tells him it's just Emily's way of dealing with her mom's death. But then weird things begin to happen; is it Emily acting out, or is the house EEEEEEEEEEEEEVIL? Or are screenwriters just lazy? There's plenty of atmosphere, and the acting really is pretty good, considering the genre, but aside from some genuinely creepy moments, there's not much that grabs you and shakes you upside down, as real taut psychological thrillers should. The final twenty minutes of the movie will make or break the movie for you. If things come as a surprise to you at that point, then you'll probably like the movie; if you've been studiously figuring them out all along, this'll sink it for you.\nIt's a pleasure to see Bob De Niro work, and he's surprisingly effective in a role that would normally go to Harrison Ford or even Mel Gibson - tough but tender. I kept expecting him to whirl around, eyes bulging, and tell Emily to \"shut the f--- up!, g--d--- it!\" Or words to that effect. De Niro isn't quite cuddly, but he's not entirely curmudgeonly, either, so that's a plus. Fanning's pretty unsettling, as she should be, and it's good to see her acting instead of cute-ing. The rest of the cast is basically interchangeable (although Dylan Baker's fantastic in his few scenes as the local sheriff); Roger Ebert notes that the Law of Economy of Characters does come into play."}

Carell is Andy Stitzer, a low-wage lackey at a Circuit City-type store who ashamedly reveals to his three coworkers that he has yet to do the deed. Naturally, they view this as a challenge.\nAndy's never really grown up, as evidenced by his extensive video game and action figure collections and his habit of riding a bicycle to work every day. He never interacts with anyone outside work, so when he's asked to play poker with his coworkers, Andy accepts. Imagine his embarrassment when he's kind of forced to admit his \"problem.\" Andy's stereotypical in many ways, which allows the audience to identify with him somewhat. We've all either been or known That Guy, the one who was still as dorky as an adult as he was in high school. Andy's extensive \"toy\" collection is his pride and joy, and one look around his small apartment indicates a stage of arrested development. It's not that Andy's not a nice guy, of course; that's actually the trouble. He never had much (any) luck with the ladies when he was younger, and as he's aged he's more or less given up on the whole idea. Too old, you see.\nVarious plans are hatched, but the lady who catches Andy's eye is Trish (Catherine Keener), who owns a shop across from Andy's store. Trish is an older woman (at least compared with the ladies that Andy's buddies at work are trying to set him up with), and she seems to sincerely dig the someone na\u00efve Andy. But is there relationship doomed? Will Andy confess to Trish that he's still untouched? I like Steve Carell, especially his fantastic Daily Show work, but I think he's a little underwhelming here. Carell doesn't act so much as react to the madness around him. That might work with some actors in some movies (such as when the chaos is continuously and uproariously funny), but the result here is a sometimes-sluggish mishmash of scattershot jokes and pathos.\nThe real shining star of the movie is Keener, who's practically unrecognizable as Trish. You might remember her from Being John Malkovich - the slinky sexuality of Maxine gives way to the earthy-dreamy concoction of Trish - and she's as spot on here as she was in that one. Some day, Keener will earn an Academy award. It won't be for this movie, though.\nAndy's coworkers and other supporting characters are okay, if not particularly developed. You have the pervy guy, the flashy hip black guy, and the guy who's constantly bemoaning his ex, who dumped him two years ago. All bring a little something to the puzzle that is this film, but none of the pieces fit all that well.\nFor what looked like a laugh-a-minute comedy about a poor schlub who's about to get off the schneid, Virgin is disappointingly slow in spots; Carell simply doesn't lend enough gravitas to the lead role to be particularly interesting.\nThe 40 Year Old Virgin: **"}

Soon after, he's approached by a Dr. Price, an expert in Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP), who claims he's been receiving messages from Jonathan's departed wife Anna via sundry electronic gadgets. Is Anna trying to tell Jonathan something? Is this merely a hint of something on a larger cosmic or otherworldly scale? It's good to see Keaton in a leading role, but the story he's stuck with is convoluted and absurd at points; it's as if the movie doesn't know how to answer any of the questions it brings up, so it just distracts the viewer with new, unrelated questions.\nKeaton himself is pretty good, convincingly cast as the bereaving widower desperately trying to communicate with his late wife. He's matured quite a bit as an actor, leaving behind the frat-friendly waacky-hijinks roles he played 15 or so years earlier. He looks a little craggy, with a perhaps few more wrinkles than one might expect, but he's lost none of the guile and panache that he's shown during his quarter century in Hollywood.\nSo it's not that Keaton turns in a mediocre performance, it's that the script itself is subpar. Written by Niall Johnson, the plot gets more confusing as it progresses, each tortuous path ending in another tortuous path. This is all well and good if the path leads to some sort of acceptable denouement, something that ties more or less everything together and explains... something. But not White Noise; I knew less about what had happened to Jonathan than I did before I'd first seen him.\nKeaton's really the only reason to watch this junk, although he gets fine support from Ian McNeice (as Dr. Price) and Deborah Kara Unger as the requisite love interest."}

Remanded to a sanitarium, Jack undergoes an unusual type of therapy at the hands of Dr. Becker (Kris Kristofferson) that involves being strapped inside a straitjacket and tossed into a morgue drawer for hours, even nights.\nDuring his time in the drawer, Jack - mostly deprived of his senses - finds he has the ability to time travel some 15 years into the future, where he sees some of the consequences of the actions of the past. Does he risk changing the future to protect the present? Alternately turgid and creepy, The Jacket relies a little too much on Brody's expressive, elongated face to move the story along. His work here isn't bad at all, really, but the plot doesn't always hold up to close scrutiny.\nBefore his arrest, Jack had encountered a woman and her young daughter alongside their disabled truck. Jack gives his dog tags to the girl and fixes the vehicle, receiving no thanks for his aid. But while in the jacket, Jack encounters a sad, disillusioned diner waitress who just happens to possess his old dog tags.\nLuckily for Jack and the audience, it doesn't take long for him to figure out what's happening when he's put into the drawer; the question is how he can use the information he's gleaned to make things better for the girl and her mother. Thrown in for good measure are the requisite Convincing a Good Doctor (a bespectacled Jennifer Jason Leigh) of His Time Traveling and Confronting the Not-Bad-but-Misguided Doctor. Oh, and figuring out who really killed the cop in the first place.\nThe plot itself isn't terribly complicated, which is certainly a relief, but it moves so slowly at times that such a benefit is rendered moot. As good of an actor that Brody (and the disheveled, gothlike Keira Knightley) is, all the clever emoting in the world can't make up for a pace somewhat akin to jogging in mud.\nOne major saving grace, though, is the ending, which feels very sincere and is in fact quite heart rendering. Very well played, even if the rest of the film isn't terribly rewarding.\nThe Jacket: **"}

It's so filthy, so heinously disgusting that it's simply not for general public consumption.\nThe premise of the joke, which has been around since vaudeville days, never really changes: \"A guy walks into a talent agent's office and says he has a great new act.\" And the punchline never changes: \"The Aristocrats!\" Ah, but what happens in between! There's the fun. As Penn Jillette (of Penn and Teller; he co-produced the film) notes, it's the singer, not the song. When you hear a note of John Coltrane, you know it's John Coltrane - doesn't matter if he's playing a complex piece or \"Happy Birthday.\" In other words, each artist has his own inimitable style.\nA joke like The Aristocrats exists to allow comics to show off their style and their ability to ad lib. Each comic takes the joke and makes it his or her own, tossing in all kinds of flowery, naughty descriptive debauchery to draw out the joke's length and effectiveness. The joke lets the comedian explore the limits of his or her own talent; how much can they improv? For, you see, no one scripts what they're going to say during a performance of the Aristocrats joke - it's mostly done off the cuff.\nAbout 100 comedians show up in this film, from such old timers as Phyllis Diller and Don Rickles to Robin Williams, Martin Mull, Howie Mandel, and even Emo Phillips. The background of the joke - that is, the performing family act that appears therein - is analyzed: Wouldn't the family have been in jail for the unspeakable acts they commit on stage in this joke? The comics also discuss how the amount of raunch in the joke has changed over the decades, as the social mores of the country as a whole have evolved. It's really quite fascinating stuff, and it never moves so ploddingly as to bore the viewer.\nOne of the biggest highlights of the joke comes when Gilbert Gottfried retells the joke during a recent Friar's Club roast of Hugh Hefner. Bear in mind that this is not a joke that's told in public - ever, mostly because of its highly offensive nature. The roast occurred shortly after September 11, 2001, and Gottfried tried to tell a joke about the terrorist attacks, something about having a connecting flight later that night with the Empire State Building. He got booed by a few people, and one guy yelled, \"Too soon!\" So after a moment's pause, Gottfried launched into The Joke, and soon people - remember, it's an audience filled with comics - were rolling in the aisles, wondering how far he'd take the joke. (Literally, in Rob Schneider's case - he was laughing so hard he fell out of his chair a couple of times.) We also get to see the boys from South Park (meaning Cartman telling the joke to Stan, Kyle, and Kenny, not Trey Parker and Matt Stone telling it), and we get to witness the darker side of Bob Saget.\nThe Aristocrats is not rated, although it's tough to see it getting anything less than an NC-17 simply for the vulgar content. You really, REALLY don't want to see this if you get offended easily, or even not so easily. Mentioned therein are incest, fecalphilia, bestiality, and all sorts of bodily fluids and functions."}

She's given a key by the man's wife, a key that opens every door in the old Bayou mansion in which they live, except one: the attic door.\nWhat lies within the walls of the attic? This creepy supernatural thriller works on many fronts, beginning with the brilliant casting of Gena Rowlands as the enigmatic, fearsome Mrs. Deveraux and the lurid, vivid atmosphere, courtesy of cinematographer Daniel Mindel.\nKate Hudson plays Caroline, who takes the job as caregiver to the invalid Ben (an unrecognizable John Hurt) partly out of a disillusionment with the professional caregiver industry. Someone has to take care of old Ben, and it can't be his equally ancient wife Violet (Rowlands), a tried-and-true Bayou queen who at first sniffs haughtily at Caroline that she's not from the area and \"Won't understand the house.\" Naturally, it isn't long before Caroline's found a way into the attic, and the ease with which she's able to enter it probably should have given her some pause. I won't give away what's in there - though you find out fairly early in the film - but I will mention that it has to do with hoodoo. Yes, I said hoodoo. The film, you see, makes the distinction between voodoo and hoodoo. In the film, it's explains that voodoo is a religion and hoodoo is just magic. Hoodoo, it turns out, is a real term, something I didn't realize while watching the film. Just throwing out that little factoid to enrich your viewing experience.\nCaroline quickly figures out something's amiss when the wheelchair-bound Ben tries to kill himself by crawling to a window on the second story in the middle of the night and jumping to the ground. Unfortunately for him, he survives - but what would drive him to such an act? Is Ben trying to tell her something? She's learned Ben suffered his stroke while in the attic - could what's up there have caused his predicament? Rowlands is fantastic as Violet Deveraux, a woman steeped in tradition and clinging to old values; she even honors the former tenants of the house by displaying their photographs. But even so, Violet is mysterious and formidable, and tries vainly to keep Caroline in mind. Gena Rowlands has always been a pretty underrated actress, but if she continues to shine in showy roles such as this, perhaps some awards will be tossed her way; she been twice nominated for Oscars, but has not won. Rowlands effortlessly rises above the material, which in some respects is forgettable.\nHudson is a surprise as her equal. Her Caroline is never cowed, but never bratty. Strong, resourceful, but ultimately believable, and that's the crux of Hudson's performance. Some may view this as the latest in young-blonde-in-peril films (see Watts, Naomi; and Geller, Sarah Michelle), but Caroline is a meatier role and acts as an excellent showcase for Hudson's yet-untapped (save for Almost Famous) range and talent.\nThe downside to a movie like The Skeleton Key is that it often sacrifices a little in plot to gain in atmosphere and name recognition. In this case, the ending might well be guessed well in advance. But it never gives you reason to stop and consider what happen next; in fact, it hardly ever gives you time to do so, thanks to rapid but even pacing."}

After freeing the woman inside, the trio is attacked by something that ultimately slices the woman in half and bites both Elly and Jimmy. Later, they notice their senses have been supersized and they've gotten stronger. They might be ... Cursed.\nCursed is a good tale of Bad Things happening to Goodish People. It's directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson, so expectations that this would be a cut above your standard teenagers-in-peril slasher pic were well founded. However, dialog that's meant to be ironic comes off as uninspiring and third rate. Craven's overall direction of the film is adequate, though, lending an appropriate dose of spooky atmosphere.\nChristinia Ricci plays Ellie, the protagonist in the film, as she juggles boy troubles, job troubles (she works on the Craig Kilborn show), and lycanthropic troubles. She's a disbeliever at first, but naturally she has her younger brother Jimmy (Jesse Eisenberg) to believe the hell out of the werewolf angle, especially since he's the proverbial nerd without friends of any shape, save Zipper the dog.\nRicci is quite good, as usual, although Eisenberg and all the other youthful thespians in the cast (such as the terminally wooden Joshua Jackson) shamefully overact, although they're somewhat restricted by the script. Williamson likes to deal in stereotypes, as he showed in the Scream movies, and most of the characters are so written in Cursed. Ellie is an exception, but the others are so broadly drawn that when they do something somewhat unexpected, you think it's a come on for something else that really is expected.\nYou might stop and ask yourself questions along the way, such as why would anyone have an opening to a horror memorabilia museum, let alone Lance Bass? Okay, maybe that one answers itself somewhat. And how come the duo - bitten by a werewolf, purportedly - sometimes have powers and sometimes don't? Oh, wait, that's also answered: The powers come and go. Got it.\nCursed is a decent film that should have been much better, given its architects. Ricci, at least, gives a nuanced and flavorful performance as the strong female lead. You'll probably laugh when you're not intended to, but if that's your game, this one might be for you."}

They plan to steal the family's SUV for a joyride, but then Things Happen, and patriarch Walter (Kevin Pollak) is smacked around. Tensions rise, and Talley hands control over to the staties. Oh, but then he's pulled back in, owing to a story contrivance meant to advance the plot and keep Bruce Willis on screen at all times.\nAnd that's a pretty good idea, all things considered. The kids in the movie are below atrocious; it's really as if there was a general casting call for child actors who'd never acted before - and then the worst of that lot was selected. When we're supposed to feel pathos for the captive son and daughter of Walter Smith, we instead feel scorn. Heck, let them get killed, if it'll end the movie that much more quickly.\nThe direction is particularly ham handed, with zero finesse applied. Points are hammered home with the subtlety of a Gallagher performance. Everything's in black and white, from the characters to the decisions each makes. Come to think of it, the movie might have been improved had it been shot in black and white.\nWillis is the saving grace, the only reason this mess didn't rate any lower than it did. He's playing a retired John McClane, for the most part. In fact, they really should have just changed his character's name and former vocation and titled this Die Hard with a Pension Plan."}

Demons, angels, stuff like that. Oddly enough, though, people believe he can - mostly because he moonlights as an exorcist, trapping demons - who shall not stay in his plane! - in mirrors and smashing them to teeny bits. World weary and constantly sucking on a coffin nail, Constantine is beleaguered and burned out, a noir detective for the afterlife, if you will. But he's alive; he's just cursed with the gift of seeing demons and angels. And he's a suicide, having been clinically dead for two minutes once upon a time, a time during which he literally saw Hell.\nCop Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) just lost her sister, a patient who jumped off the top of a mental hospital; Angela thinks her sister also Saw Something, and so she goes to John for help. Did Isabel know something? Where is she now? Can Angela see, too? Well, she can, actually, because Isabel was her twin sister, and as we all know twins share everything. So, using Angela, Constantine learns that the Bad Guys (demons), who are supposed to stay in Hell, have been crossing over to the plane of the living, presumably to raise hell. But Constnatine knows there's something else afoot, something only witchcraft, voodoo, and other otherworldly things can uncover.\nIf there was ever a role that the adult Reeves was born to play (besides that of Neo), it's that of John Constantine. Constantine wanders hither and yon, doing good deeds and helping with crimes involving the occult, and so forth, all with a resigned and - pardon another pun - rather soulless attitude. Constantine knows he's doomed to a lifetime of doing this, partly because he tried to kill himself and partly because he has The Gift. It's this kind of dispassionate nihilism that plays perfectly to Reeves' own dull, emotionless acting range. He's perfect for the role, based on a comic book called Hellblazer.\nWeisz is pretty good - believable, at least - as the clumsily named Angela, but the real standout among the supporting cast is Peter Stormare as Satan himself. Incredibly creepy; he looks like a kindergarten teacher but behaves like a pedophile. The hair on the back of your neck will rise when Stormare enters the picture about three-fourths through.\nTwo other things the movie has going for it are a rather simplistic plot and some fantastic special effects (for example, a demon made up of bugs). Movies based on comic books tend to overburden themselves and the viewer with far too many plot twists. It's not tough - you have a good guy, you have a bad guy, and the first must defeat the second. Throw in some ethical and moral conflicts, give the good guy a power of sorts, and you're off and running. Constantine does this pretty well.\nThe atmosphere of the film is riveting as well, with effects special and otherwise transporting the viewer to Right There, whether it's a voodoo bar, Hell, or the mean streets of the city.\nIf you watch the movie with the idea that it's a filmed comic book, you shouldn't be dissatisfied with the result. John Constantine lives in a world in which he sees unspeakable evil on a daily basis, and he himself has literally been to Hell and back on more than one occasion. His lot is to suffer for his sin; can he find redemption in a cutie named Angela?"}

So she takes her novice skill level to Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), notable trainer of he-man boxers. Noting that Maggie's not really male, Frankie treats her with a lot of disdain and disrespect, but grudgingly - with the help of his canny janitor/man-at-arms, Scrap (Morgan Freeman) agrees to train Maggie. At least until she can find a manager. Which she never does.\nSwank again gets the Oscar nod (she also won for Boys Don't Cry), but this isn't her show at all - it's that of the two old codgers, Eastwood and Freeman. Freeman's excellence finally gets the level of recognition it deserves, as he won an Oscar, too, and Eastwood won for Best Director.\nThe first three-quarters of the movie is pretty standard little-punk-against-all-the-odds fare, kind of a step or two above The Karate Kid, but along the same lines. Scrap and Frankie impart wisdom both practical and metaphysical to Maggie, who nods and flashes the largest set of teeth this side of a sabre-toothed tiger. Seriously, Hilary should look into getting those things capped or chiseled down, or something. Swank's job is to look innocent and deserving, but still appear skillful and eager to learn more. Eastwood and Freeman just need to look smart and worldly, not to mention world-weary. All succeed in these broad characterizations.\nThe final quarter of the movie, though, takes us on a sharp left turn away from the norm. I won't give away the plot turn - it's not a twist, just a turn - but it quickly moves the tone of the movie from inspirational to sappy, from Rocky to Lifetime cable movies. As the audience, we're supposed to feel for Maggie, no matter what happens, and that almost works against things here; Maggie Fitzgerald is shown as a saint, quite frankly. Everything she does seems to be right, or at least Well Intentioned, and most people on the planet aren't quite that ethereal.\nStill, it's tough not to root for the little dickens. Maggie's feisty and is determined to succeed; no small feat, considering she's scrawny even after a couple years of self-training. She's motivated by having been told how much of a loser she is throughout her life (she's 31 when the movie begins); if she's unsuccessful as a fighter, she has nothing else to do, nowhere else to go. Presumably, anyway. She's waitressing, after all, and does have a job when she begins training with Frankie, so she's really not as bad off as she wants to appear.\nThe chemistry between the toothy Swank and the toothless Eastwood should have been fantastic - Oscar winners both, of course - but for me their verbal interplay fell flat. I felt like I was watching two people do a cold reading. On the other hand, old pros Eastwood and Freeman played off each other perfectly, for dramatic and comedic effects. Their scenes together - and one gets the impression that Freeman's Scrap Iron wasn't as huge a character in the original version of the script - were flawless and highly enjoyable to watch, sort of like seeing a married couple interact.\nAs with most athletics-related movies, Million Dollar Baby will try to manipulate you, and it's fairly successful in that arena. However, the final reel of the movie just didn't completely work for me, seeming more like a disease-of-the-week teleplay than an Academy Award-winning movie."}
< {"rating": "6", "date": "6 July 2005", "title_id": "tt0338751", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "Bad Leo, strong supporting cast", "content": "Martin Scorcese's lengthy homage to Howard Hughes is alternately gripping and aloof and unfortunately is forced to rely far too much on the dubious acting talents of its lead, Leonardo DiCaprio. As Hughes, the perpetually cherubic DiCaprio simply doesn't have enough panache for the role, and the sometimes-garish makeup that's intended to show Hughes' aging merely accentuates DiCaprio's anachronistic performance.\nThe movie spans a few decades in Hughes' heyday, from the 1920s to the 1940s, from his beginnings as producer/director of Hell's Angels to his appearance before a Senate investigatorial committee. Hughes fights with everyone - Hollywood censors, the starlets he dated, his employees, the U.S. government, and rival airline tycoons, sometimes to the benefit of Hughes' myriad business interests, and more often to their debit. The film largely deals with Hughes' involvement in films and in the airline business, choosing to gloss over or ignore entirely his casinos in Las Vegas and the years leading up to his death in 1976.\nAt the crux of things, though, are Hughes the Film Producer and Hughes the Aviation Pioneer. From his long-delayed Hell's Angels - which made him a national star - to his mammary-obsessed The Outlaw, The Aviator shows how single-minded Hughes was in his relentless pursuit of the Perfect Movie. Because he was independently wealthy and could lean on his own funds to keep production moving, Hughes worked outside the traditional Hollywood studio system, shaping Hollywood to fit his own ideas and methods. Not everything worked - and not every idea was well received - but Hughes remained a man unwilling to compromise his principles; some might call this \"stubbornness.\" Juxtaposed with Hughes' film travails is his constant drive to improve aviation, from the purchase of what would become TWA to the innovative behemoth Spruce Goose, which unfortunately flew a distance of one mile exactly one time. Hughes is shown as a notorious perfectionist, personally inspecting each new aircraft to see that it met his (unspecified) standards.\nAt 170 minutes long, The Aviator manages to cram in many useful and interesting tidbits about Hughes' life and times, and even though certain aspects of his personality were omitted (such as his alleged aversion to African Americans), one doesn't get the sense that something's missing. This is a credit to the screenwriter, John Logan, although the runtime didn't hurt.\nAs is usually the case with DiCaprio movies, the biggest liability in the movie was Leonard DiCaprio himself. As Hughes gets older in the movie, poor Leo looks exactly the same - and worse, acts exactly the same. Even when he's not laden with makeup, DiCaprio looks like he's about 12 years old and facing the real world for the first time. In The Aviator, he has the gravitas of an empty suit, never appearing to be more than, perhaps, the son of Howard Hughes. DiCaprio isn't terrible in the movie, he's just not terribly believable.\nHis supporting cast is pretty good, though, especially John C. Reilly as his number-two guy and all-around abuse receiver, Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, and Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe, the head of Hughes' rival in air, Pan Am. When you have strong professional performances like the work these people turned in, the movie can suffer an underwhelming lead. Unfortunately, one of the key supporting roles wasn't quite as fulfilling as it should have been - that of Katharine Hepburn, played quirkily by Cate Blanchett. Blanchett adopted Hepburn's idiosyncrasies and personality tics as well as her odd, off-putting stuttering vocal delivery. Now, I'm not saying the real Katharine Hepburn wasn't exactly as Blanchett portrayed her, but her mannerisms were so over the top that they were distracting and annoying. Blanchett won an Oscar for her performance; I believe a Razzie would have been more suitable.\nThe movie's not much more than an interesting glimpse at a long-dead icon until it reaches the Senate hearings chaired by Senator Brewster (Alan Alda, who also garnered an Oscar nomination). Here especially, Hughes' strength really shows through, although a present-day viewer might wonder how much of the hearings proceeded exactly as depicted in this movie. Alda, by the way, is fine - although I kept seeing those usual Alda mannerisms, which made me think of Hawkeye Pierce instead of a bad-guy politico.\nOverall, The Aviator isn't quite the epic it wanted to be, and although it's well paced and benefits from fine supporting performances, it does suffer from an unworthy lead performance."}
< {"rating": "5", "date": "29 June 2005", "title_id": "tt0407304", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "Misses the mark; an unfortunate Spielberg failure", "content": "Like the giant tripod robots from hell that invade Earth, War of the Worlds is shaky and collapses easily under its own weight. Sure, the effects are typically extraordinary for a Spielberg film, but the invasion itself is illogical and the scenes in which the human characters interact with each other fall flatter than the buildings that the robots stomp.\nA freakish lightning storm knocks out all power, including cell phones and automobiles. This shouldn't have been much of a shock to anyone, since apparently every news report leading up to the storm discussed electromagnetic pulses in other parts of the world that... knocked out all power. I guess that might have been a comment on how Americans don't pay much attention to world events. As the local denizens scratch their heads in consternation and frustration, giant machines rise up from underground and then obliterate everyone in their paths. Madness ensues.\nWe see all of this death and destruction through the eyes of Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) and his kids Robbie and Rachel (Justin Chatwin and Dakota Fanning, respectively). Robbie's a typical sullen teenager, veering between responsible older brother and impudent jerk. Unsurprisingly, he doesn't have a strong relationship with his father, and neither does Rachel. The kids have been conveniently dropped off for the weekend by their very-pregnant mom (the seldom-seen Miranda Otto), all the better for them all to potentially reunite at the end of the movie.\nMuch of the movie involves ducking and running and running some more, and mobs of angry people who resemble zombies without the cold logic, and tentacles, and aliens, and about a zillion shocked looks on Mr. Cruise's face. That's about it. Run, run, take a breath, run some more, peek around a corner. It goes on like this for a while, during which time we see humans alternately being vaporized or eviscerated. In fact, the violence is pretty intense, and I wonder what had to be cut in order for the film to attain a PG-13 rating.\nThe scariest movies are the ones that have at least a strong hint of realism - the audience, in other words, must feel as if what is happening on screen could definitely happen to them. And it's easy to imagine the events in War of the Worlds happening. Oh, perhaps not a full-on alien invasion, but a gigantic catastrophe of some stripe. That's why Independence Day was so popular, and it's also why Close Encounters of the Third Kind was so special.\nOf course, Spielberg was responsible for Close Encounters, but this one doesn't approach the magic of the earlier film. At least with Close Encounters, we had a vague idea of why we were being visited; here, although we know they're here to kill us all, we don't know why, exactly. And how is it that giant machines could be buried underground for millions of years without anyone knowing? Surely we have the necessary equipment to detect giant metal.\nWhile the effects are a huge credit to the movie - and ultimately save it - the script and the acting are two major debits, particularly Cruise and Fanning. Cruise normally plays characters who are the Smartest Guys in the Room, exuding coolness at all times. Ray's not a smart guy. He's an idiot and an incredibly bad father, as he seems to have a knack of putting his kids in danger (although he gets better at that as the movie progresses). Unfortunately, Cruise simply doesn't have the range to play an idiot; Ray comes off as just an obnoxious and selfish. Indeed, he spends much of the movie shocked, shocked at what's going on - which would be anyone's natural reaction, of course, but this movie needed a hero of some sort, kind of like Dennis Quaid in the similarly themed The Day after Tomorrow.\nOnce upon a time, Fanning was cute and talented. She's all of 11 years old now, and she's neither cute nor talented. True, her character spends much of the movie fleeing in terror or screaming her head off, but any actress could have done that. Rachel is far too broadly written, and inconsistently so; sometimes she's precocious, offering Ray advice on dealing with Robbie, and other times she's dumber than your average 10 year old.\nWhy couldn't this movie have been better? Spielberg and Cruise worked very well on Minority Report, and Spielberg's gone the aliens route before with E.T. and Close Encounters, so why did this one fail? I don't think it's unreasonable to expect their collaborations to be pretty good, given their track records, and War of the Worlds simply misses the mark. The action scenes are very intense, almost draining the audience of emotion, but the scenes with actual dialog are terribly shallow and predictable, not to mention unintentionally funny."}

Then you see your hopes dashed when you realize it's all just an excuse to cuss a lot and show puppets having sex. But more on that later.\nBut the sad truth is that Team America doesn't live up to its own hype. Sure, the use of marionettes is cute, but it's just a novelty, one whose appeal fades during the first twenty minutes or so.\nSouth Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut seemed to me to be what Trey Parker and Matt Stone wanted the television series to be - if they didn't have to bother with censors and sensibilities. The movie was a giant middle finger to Hollywood and the MPAA, too. Team America merely repeats the gesture, only with the puppet novelty.\nThe story goes thus. Gary Johnston, a Broadway actor, is recruited by Team America, an organization dedicated to ridding the world of evil dictators and terrorists. The team, with the wheelchair-bound Spottswood e (note the clumsy pun) as its leader - needs an actor who can get them into and out of situations seamlessly. Once they've thwarted a terrorist meeting in Cairo - laying the city to waste in its wake - they learn of a bigger plot involving the use of WMDs.\nThe plot is fairly topical - will anyone remember who Hans Blix was, 20 years hence? - but for the moment it's not a hindrance. It's quite simplistic, but of course it's meant to be, since the movie is parodying simplistic Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer blockbuster extravaganzas.\nBut even if you get past the dopey plot, you quickly notice that the jokes aren't terribly funny; they're scattershot, much like the ubiquitous machine guns employed in the film. And the songs aren't all that memorable, unless you count remembering that there was a plethora of profanity as being memorable.\nIn essence, Team America is what you might expect to be produced by a first-year film student with no morals. Crude and graphic, it fails on its most appealing level: satire of both the worldview of the United States and the propensity of Hollywood to make loud, meaningless action movies. The jokes and ideas aren't sly and knowing, they're obvious and pointless.\nThere's nothing wrong with being offensive, of course; Parker and Stone do it for a living. But in the past, they've been offensive with a greater purpose - often the satire of commonly held mores or institutions.\nWhich brings me to the puppet coitus. It's not amusing. It's not titillating. It just kind of makes you uncomfortable, like catching monkeys at the zoo going at it. The difference here is that as audience member you're sort of captive, whereas in the zoo you can keep on walking.\nKeep walking, folks. Nothing to see here."}

If not for the bigger budget, it might have even been as good.\nIt's New Year's Eve at dilapidated Precinct 13, which is closing down. Just about all on-duty cops have been reassigned to other precincts, and all that's left are Sergeant Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), Jasper O'Shea (Brian Dennehy), and Iris Ferry (Drea de Matteo). And all is pretty quiet, in the midst of a thick snowstorm, until a bus of convicts is rerouted to lucky Precinct 13. One of the convicts is gangster Marion Bishop (Larry Fishburne), who's due to testify in front of a grand jury.\nWouldn't you know it, the placid precinct is infiltrated by two masked men who are quickly thwarted by Roenick. The intruders - quickly joined outside by a posse of similarly disguised thugs - aren't there to bust Bishop out, however - they're there to kill him. And they're not criminals, exactly; they're cops.\nSo Roenick has to fend off the corrupt cops and keep his team from killing each other. He has to rely on the talents of the other convicts and must explicitly trust Bishop - the baddies outside have superior numbers, headed by Marcus Duvall (Gabriel Byrne), and they'll stop at nothing to kill Bishop, along with everyone else in the building.\nHawke, who looked pretty handy with a gun in Training Day, is really good here, as his Jake keeps his head while all those around him lose theirs. And, lucky fella, he has not one but two hot women to serve and protect - de Matteo's Iris and Maria Bello's Alex Sabian, Roenick's shrink. Toss in Dennehy as the grizzled veteran about to call it a career, John Leguizamo as a hyperactive junkie, and Ja Rule as... well, Ja Rule, and you have all flavors of clich\u00e9.\nBut funny thing about this unoriginal piece of work - it's pretty good. Director Jean-Francois Richet does an admirable job with the atmosphere, with close-up cinema verite angles that make you feel the cops are breathing down your neck. The movie's well paced, too, with little letup in action; luckily, there are no slow moments of restful contemplation. No sir, this is not an action movie for tenderhearts.\nAmong the supporting case, de Matteo, Ja Rule, Leguizamo, and especially Fishburne come off best; not so much for Bello, Byrne, and Dennehy, although they don't seem to have had much to work with. Bello's character in particular is annoying and probably didn't need to be in the movie, although her raison d'etre is apparent late in the film. Byrne looks as stonefaced as always, as evocative as a damp sponge. But that's Gabriel Byrne's own raison d'etre.\nIntense, well-directed and filmed, this remake of a remake (following 1959's Rio Bravo) is likable on many levels. If the idea of a remake was tackled with as small of a budget as its 1976 predecessor, this might have been quite a work of art. As it is, still very entertaining."}

It's good, not great, Caped Crusader pulp fiction; better than Batman and Robin and Batman Returns, but not quite as good as the second original Batman.\nA well-known comic book character has an albatross around its neck: its own history. Since we know a lot about Batman, the movie about his genesis has to really convince us it's the same guy - it has to be sincere. Well, Batman Begins is awfully earnest - perhaps much too earnest - and the origins of certain of his trademarks are well explained, but the movie suffers from a noncharismatic lead and a tone that seems more suited to a generic James Bond movie.\nLet's star with Bats himself, Christian Bale. Bale is perhaps best known as the serial killer in American Psycho, and while playing a psychotic might well prepare one for being Batman, he simply doesn't provide enough oomph to the role. Remember, the role demands that the actor be hidden in a lycra suit for a good deal of the movie, so he has to be expressive with his face, commanding with his voice; a strong presence, in other words. Bale doesn't quite accomplish any of this - he comes off as more of a poor man's Tom Cruise, with limited facial expressions and emotions. Plus - and I don't mean to be unkind here - Bale has a gigantic light bulb for a head. Bruce Wayne's supposed to be somewhat suave; I kept looking for the dangly chain to make him light up.\nMoving on, we see the highly publicized Katie Holmes as the requisite love interest, Rachel Dawes. Holmes is amusingly miscast, far too much of a lightweight for the role. Her character is supposed to be in her twenties, but poor Katie acts and looks like she's still in high school. As with Bale, I looked in vain for something - a class ring, in Holmes' case. At any rate, she's about as convincing as Chris Farley as the Pope. There's not much chemistry between her and Bale in the few scenes they share, and she seems like she's only four lessons into a ten-lesson course of Acting with an A.\nLuckily, the supporting gang is quite good; this is what happens when you hire talented veteran talent. The elegant Michael Caine is onboard as Alfred, Bruce's butler and muse. Caine was born for the veddy proper role, and one can easily see the latter-day Alfred (Michael Gough in the other films) in Caine's portrayal. Morgan Freeman is Lucius Fox, the scientist who gets Bruce his Cool Gadgets, and Rutger Hauer is the nominal boss of Wayne Enterprises, megalomaniacally trying to take over the company, or something. Hauer's sort of wasted - any Eurotrash would have done as well in the role. But most of the other major supporting characters are the underwire to the bra of the plot. That's a good thing, for all you virgin males out there.\nDirector Christopher Nolan is the guy who gave us Memento and Insomnia, but the trouble here is that there's nothing Christopher Nolan-like about the movie. Tim Burton's Batman had Tim Burton written all over it, and that's one thing that made it as successful as it was. But normally, with movies in a series (for example, the Bond films) it's not necessary to get a Big Name director to do the deed; you just need someone who will be true to the oeuvre; the Bat universe, in this case. So although it's nifty that they got the hot Nolan to direct, I don't think it was necessary.\nBatman Begins isn't badly written at all, but the first half does seem awfully slow. Get to the good stuff, you may whine. Let's lay off this James Bond crap and get to the avenging-death-of-parents bit. It's good that we learn why Bruce chose the Batman name, how he came upon his cape and gadgets, where the Batmobile came from, and when the Bat Signal was first used... but we need to see all that mystical be-the-one mumbo jumbo? I felt like I'd stumbled upon an old Mountain Dew commercial."}

So, with his trusty sidekick Riley (Justin Bartha) and a reluctant expert, Abigail (Diane Kruger), he sets out to steal the treasured document and discover the cache of loot for which he and his own forefathers have been searching for decades.\nCage makes like Indiana Jones here, and while he's no Harrison Ford (even a younger Harrison Ford), he's a spot better than you might expect. He's never quite believable as an action hero in this movie, but he seems authentic as a man of letters, a clever conniver, a sly sleuth. Good thing, because he's pretty much the entire show here, save for the awesome footage of Genuine American Historical Monuments. Anytime you can sneak in recognizable landmarks, your film will stand apart from the others in the genre; it'll be more memorable. Check out a minor Hitchcock film, Saboteur, and you'll see excellent use of the Statue of Liberty.\nThe movie is apparently based quite loosely on the Dan Brown novel The DaVinci Code. I haven't read the book yet, mostly because I'm too cheap to go buy it and it's always, always out on loan from my library. But I've heard from very reputable sources that National Treasure is basically a ripoff of the DaVinci Code story, albeit supercharged as an action thriller extravaganza. I bet the book didn't things blowing up all the time, but that's what you have to expect from a Jerry Bruckheimer film. I'd advise you to read the book instead, for I hear it's clever and entertaining; the movie gets it only half right.\n,Although the logical train Gates follows from clue to clue seems somewhat implausible at times, don't let that distract you from a fun time. Don't let the clich\u00e9s of a hot-but-smart female sidekick; a smooth, superrich Eurotrash villain; and a wisecracking computer-whiz male sidekick deter you, either. But wait, don't shut your brain off entirely. You want to see how many of the clues you'll understand before Gates does. In fact, make a drinking game of it. Every time he says, \"I'm working on it!\" or looks exasperated, do a shot. I guarantee you'll be snockered in no time.\nOne other minor debit is that there really isn't much chemistry between Cage and Kruger. I mean, every hero has to have The Girl, and they just don't seem to click. Maybe they didn't like each other. Maybe Cage tried to put the moves on Kruger and she slapped him silly. Whatever the reason, they just don't seem too into each other, as they're supposed to be.\nIn all, it's not too bad, and probably best seen on a big screen, the better to see Stuff Get Blown Up."}

Remember, once upon a time Sorvino won an Oscar, and she hasn't done a heck of a lot since. Williams has been nominated four times, winning for Good Will Hunting in 1998. Both, then, have some credentials. So why are they in this junk? Sorvino overacts outrageously in the few scenes she's in. Sometimes this is called \"stealing scenes,\" but only when the overacting seems appropriate for the particular scene. Needless to say, Sorvino's performance is never really appropriate.\nWilliams isn't a lot better. Sure, he's not Manic Robin, dancing all over the screen like he has ADHD; he's Serious Robin, the kind we saw in One Hour Photo and Insomnia. This Robin is a fantastic actor. He's not terrible here, but he just seems out of place. He seems to be sleepwalking through the role.\nAll in all, The Final Cut is a fairly low-key movie that doesn't live up to its own premise."}

Benedict wants his money back - plus interest - or else. In this milder, innocuous sequel to the 2001 film (itself a remake of the 1960 film), the Eleven-Plus-One must pull off three major robberies in Europe to satisfy Benedict.\nIt's an intriguing premise, and yet for some reason I thought the idea was that they were going to perform all three capers at the same time, which would have been a neat feat to watch, what with the gang having only eleven members. But alas and alack, that's not how it shook down. What we do get are three separate robbery attempts, each running into greater difficulty than the previous. Kind of like the logistics of getting a whole mess o' Big Stars to rearrange their schedules so they could work on this floppy film at cut-rate prices.\nDanny and his boys have their work cut out for them, because they also have a rival - the Night Fox, a wealthy man-about-town who effortlessly steals, steals, steals. Seems he's the best there is, ever was, ever will be, or something like that. And he's one step ahead of Ocean all the time. Don't you just hate people like that? Meanwhile, Linus (Matt Damon) wants a larger role in the planning of heists and such, perhaps as a sidekick/apprentice to Danny and Rusty (Brad Pitt). Why director Steven Soderbergh thought Linus needed more screen time is beyond me; the whole secondary plot of the misfit Linus trying to assert himself seemed a bit out of place - and quite a bit of a stretch for Movie Star Matt Damon.\nWhich kind of brings me to another slightly annoying aspect of the movie - all the Movie Stars. Sure, I know they all took way-smaller salaries to work on this film, and bravo to them. But you could never get away from the fact that this was a star-studded affair, something a little above Battle of the Network Stars but not quite as good as, say, Chicago. Pitt and Clooney usurp most of the screen time anyway, although Damon and Julia Roberts are a close second. Luckily, there are plenty of other familiar faces: Elliot Gould, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Scott Caan, Casey Affleck ... Oh, and did I mention Catherine Zeta-Jones? She's an intrepid Interpol agent who shares a past with Rusty, and she's hot on the trail of the Ocean Gang. Unfortunately, she's a bit underused, although a late subplot about her works fine, although it seems shoehorned in.\nThe plot gets a little complicated at times, and you might well ask yourself, \"Where are they now? Why are they doing that?\" and so forth. I liked the intricacies of the plot of the 2001 film, but for some reason this script left me a little cold. Complex is fine, but the plot still needs to draw you in, and it just didn't do so this time around.\nThe first half of the movie kind of dragged a bit for me, but I'm glad I stuck with it. In the second half, there are a couple of excellent cameos - both surprises to me - and some clever twists indeed. The action in the latter half of the movie did make up for the torpidity (look it up!) of the first half. Kudos to George Nolfi's script, albeit somewhat grudgingly.\nThe acting isn't bad at all; in fact, the players all seem to be enjoying themselves immensely, which is kind of what all-star movies are all about."}

I don't mean just an empty feeling because there are no more Star Wars films on the horizon, I mean empty as in sadly unfulfilling. If Star Wars Episode III were a candy bar, it wouldn't be Snickers.\nGoing into the theater, you already have a sense of what'll be in the movie, because you know how Episode IV (aka Star Wars) began. So you know which characters from Episodes I and II won't make it to the end of III, you know what'll happen to the Jedi Council, and you know who turns evil and gets to wear a totally badass helmet.\nSometimes being familiar with characters (perhaps intimately) is a good thing, because it makes it all the easier for one to root for them. On the other hand, knowing what's going to happen - and how things will end - can also be a debit, because then the viewer has a certain set of expectations that he or she feels should be met, expectations that when not met contribute to feelings of disappointment and disillusionment.\nAnakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), pupil to Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) torn between aiding the Jedi Council and Chancellor Palpatine while war rages on against Darth Sidious, Count Dooku, General Grievous, and the rest of the merry men of evil. Meanwhile, his wife Padme (Natalie Portman) can see her husband only in secret, lest knowledge of the union between a Jedi and a senator become known.\nEven though there are plenty of explosions, stunts, and general mayhem, the movie is really about the moral failings of man: Should Anakin stay on the true path as the Chosen One, fighting for good along with the other Jedi Knights? Or should he succumb to the Dark Side and help those he loves? Can he be selfish and selfless at the same time? Since he is such a young warrior, it seems, he is easily manipulated, but the catch is that he knows he's being manipulated by someone. Anakin's problem is that he doesn't know who is doing the manipulation, and he suddenly doesn't know whom to trust. Trust is a central theme to the story: Anakin's trust of the Council, of Obi-Wan, and of Padme; the Council's trust of Anakin and Palpatine; Padme's trust of Anakin. Their relationships offer an interesting juxtaposition with the violence and action surrounding them.\nWith the first two episodes of the prequels, the viewer really didn't know what to expect. We knew where Star Wars began, of course, and we knew these three movies would lead us to it, but we didn't know how. What adventures would happen along the way? But with the third movie, less was left unknown before the movie even began. I knew what was going to happen, so I was counting on George Lucas to perhaps throw me a few curveballs to keep me off balance - and, of course, wow me with his special effects wizardry.\nMy problem with the third episode was that it was simply there; it's almost as if it were a bridge to the fourth episode, rather than being a standalone episode itself. I wasn't really excited by this movie, which is in itself a major disappointment. I wasn't shocked, amazed, or surprised, and that's a real shame. True, it's great to see familiar characters (including late in the movie who shows up in the next episodes), and it's fun to see them do battle against their sworn enemies. It's fascinating to watch Anakin turn from callow youth to diabolic fiend bent on ruling the galaxy. But I knew the end result, and there was nothing compelling about the storyline.\nOn the plus side, the acting by Christensen and Portman - especially in their shared scenes - has dramatically improved, although there are still moments when Christensen seems like he's only four lessons into a ten-lesson acting course. McGregor channels the late Alec Guiness; one can easily see how he becomes the old man we see in Episode IV.\nEven at nearly two and a half hours, the movie is fairly well paced, without some of the lulls that plagued the first two prequels. And the effects are certainly believable, not to mention those employed to animate Yoda and other nonhuman characters. The hand-to-hand fighting scenes are wonderful to behold, always credible.\nBut the movie just doesn't grab you the way it should. It's the final movie in the series; we won't see another one. It should grab the viewer by the ears and shake him a bit. Instead, George Lucas' epic series finally comes to a close not with a bang-pop-zowie of an exploding Death Star but with the slight whimper of a Jedi sliced in two by a light saber."}

Miles, an avid - some would say sneeringly snotty - oenophile, comes up with the nifty idea of the two of them driving up the coast of California touring various wineries and vineyards and such. That way Miles can show off his knowledge and Jack can have a one last good, free time.\nOne small problem. Although Miles is perfectly content to wine and whine for the week, Jack's eye wanders - and soon he's setting up a double dinner date with a winery employee (Sandra Oh) and a waitress (Virginia Madsen). Suddenly the trip's not about the two friends bonding one last time, it's more about Jack sowing his wild oats (figuratively, hopefully) while he still can. This change in plans leads to awkward, funny, and funny-awkward moments; meanwhile, poor Miles - recovering from a divorce (and finding out secondhand that his ex-wife has just remarried) and waiting to hear if his latest literary opus will be accepted for publication - is a walking rubber band ball of neuroses and nerves. He tries to maintain the trip's focus, while Jack just tries to have a little fun.\nAs with most buddy films, Things That Go Wrong tend to snowball into something far greater, and on one level Sideways is a typical road trip movie, including assumptions, lies, illogical decisions, red herrings, and so forth - all in the name of low comedy. But on another level, the movie is an honest look at love and relationships from the perspective of a single, closing-in-on-middle-age male.\nEven though Giamatti and Church were hardly unknown actors before Sideways, this is truly the breakthrough film for each. Giamatti, a veteran character actor perhaps best known for his role as Pig Vomit in the screen version of Howard Stern's Private Parts, is perfectly in his element as the self-obsessed, nervous, sincere Miles. It's a performance to which many people can instantly relate; Miles is not handsome, he's not smooth, he's not really all that charming, but somehow he's still appealing. He's a good guy who tries to do well and sometimes suffers the whims of Lady Luck. Church is known for two TV series he was in, \"Wings\" and \"Ned & Stacey,\" and I can't recall his ever being classified as a good actor, just an entertaining one. But he's wonderful as the rowdy, randy, perpetually horny Jack; he seems to give the role an extra layer of depth. You can't just write Jack off as a selfish bastard, just as you can't just write Miles off as a dork.\nDirector Alexander Payne, who made the clever Election, does a fantastic job at transforming what's really a two-character study (everyone else, including the two female leads, is background to the relationship between Miles and Jack) into a realistic, fully textured movie. Payne's screenplay doesn't dwell on caricatures and doesn't offer pat explanations or resolutions. Sometimes, the film tells us, things don't end up good or bad. They just continue on.\nAlthough Giamatti and Church are at center stage, Oh and Madsen are both fantastic, although perhaps slightly underused. In particular, Madsen (who earned an Oscar nomination, as did Church), makes the most of her brief screen time, oozing intelligence, wit, charm, and sexuality from every pore.\nSideways doesn't move too slowly and isn't too talky, and because wine is one theme, there are plenty of beautifully photographed scenes of the lovely Napa Valley's vineyards. Sideways is thoughtful, entertaining, and fascinating."}

Go see it and love the overwrought cheesy sentimentality out of it.\nCloser is about four people, two sets of couples, whose lives fall apart when two of them begin an affair with each other. Dan (Jude Law) helps Alice (Natalie Portman) when she's struck by a cab. The two quickly fall for each other, of course. Not long after, Dan - an aspiring writer - has his picture professionally taken for the book jacket of his novel. The photographer is Anna (Julie Roberts); unsurprisingly, Dan falls for her as well, and vice versa. And then somehow Larry (Clive Owen) tumbles into the mix; he's tricked by Dan into meeting Anna, who falls for him, but then he falls for Alice, and... Oh, what's the use? Those of you who love romantic dramas will likely get into this, and those who do not, won't.\nBut here's the thing, okay? It's a talky, slow movie that relies very heavily on a rather turgid, melodramatic script - not to mention the charms of the four very good-looking leads. At times, the dialog really clicks with some subtle, clever twists of the word, but most of the movie is filled with dopey, unrealistic, stilted verbalizations. It's not that the movie doesn't make any sense; on the contrary, it's fairly simple to follow. So simple, in fact, that you can easily tell what's coming next. There are no surprises in Closer.\nThe tone is set very early, with an inexorable opening song that seems to merely repeat its refrain ad infinitum. Much like the movie, which repeats its theme in the same grueling, amateurish manner, only with different characters. Look! Now she's dumping him! Now he's with her and dumping the other one! Woohoo! Go, you wacky lovers, go! The casting is pretty good, though. Julie Roberts can really act, you know, and she's quite effective here. Law isn't bad, but he's been much better - he actually overacts late in the film, going against the grain of understated quiet. They do make a cute couple, though. Which leads me to Portman, who's the lightweight of the bunch. She turns in a fairly good performance, although there were a couple scenes in which she just didn't feel right for the role. Owen's character is the crass bastard of the lot, and the actor is up the task. But damn, Colin! You couldn't shave for the role? You look like you should be hiding in bushes, waiting to flash little old ladies. But then again, that was part of his character's appeal.\nAs interesting as the circuitry in a pocket calculator, as engrossing as a 1975 auto-repair manual, and as excruciating as a long morning in a dentist's chair, Closer is a dream come true for folks who like sitting in a catatonic state, drool seeping out of the corner of their mouths."}

Barrie (Johnny Depp) created Peter Pan, inspired by an equally struggling widow (Kate Winslet) and her four rambunctious boys. Exquisitely detailed, with sumptuous and elaborate set pieces, Marc Forster's filming of the Allan Knee play is artful without being arty.\nJohnny Depp is perfectly cast as Barrie, although there's the usual caveat that Johnny Depp is perfectly cast in almost anything. He might well be the best actor working today, especially since he refuses to let himself become typecast. Hard to believe now that he used to be on that old Fox TV show, isn't it? Depp is dead-on earnest as the wise, soulful Barrie, who becomes a sort-of surrogate father to the four Davies boys, whose father has since passed away (although in real life he hadn't yet died when Barrie met the family).\nAlthough the movie is about the creation of Peter Pan, at its heart are smaller dovetailing storythreads about relationships, particularly those between Barrie and his wife, Mary (Radha Mitchell), Barrie and Sylvia Davies (Winslet), and Barrie and the youngest Davies boy, Peter (Freddie Highmore). Depp's mastery of expression and pathos are on display here, as he turns in an utterly commanding, pitch-perfect performance; his Oscar nomination for this role was well deserved indeed.\nDepp is supported by an excellent cast that looks like it's been performing the roles for years. In particular, Winslet and Mitchell were magnificent, as was the venerable Julie Christie, who plays Sylvia's mother Mrs. Emma du Maurier. Dustin Hoffman turns in decent work as Charles Frohman, the proprietor of the playhouse in which Barrie's plays were performed (in other words, his patron). As Depp is now, Hoffman was long known for being able to disappear into a role - his roles in the 1970s alone are mighty eclectic indeed.\nThis is a sheer beauty to behold, a movie that should certainly stand the test of time to be regarded in a few decades as a true classic. Your jaw will drop at some of the set pieces on display - check out the pirate ship! - and you'll marvel at the jaunty forays into the imagination of the playwright who never grew up. Finding Neverland will have even the most jaded and heartless melting and shimmering with pure, unadulterated joy."}

It's beautiful, it's intriguing, and it'll have you scratching your head in mystified dissonance.\nAmanda (Matlin) is a divorced photographer who's somehow just plugging along in life, not really enjoying herself but not really swimming in pain, either. One day she finds the world she knows - the world we know, the physical world - blending with that of the other, deeply hidden worlds that inhabit our universe: the cellular, molecular, and quantum worlds.\nWhat is reality? the movie asks. What do we know, and why do we know it? Isn't reality shaped by our own perceptions? The scientists examine these questions without actually answering them. How can they, really? There is so very little that we as humans know about our selves and our universe.\nSupported by amazing visual effects, the movie successfully relies on the impassioned earnestness with which the scientists deliver their thoughts. None of them are as dry as the lecturers I sometimes had in college; rather, they are so emotionally divested, so enthusiastic in their pursuit of the mysteries of life, the universe, and everything, that even those who never graduated from college can comprehend the rather complex issues being discussed.\nWhat the #$*! Do We Know!? isn't necessarily for everyone, but although the subject matter is pretty heavy, the movie's approach is never heavy handed. You don't have to buy into any of the theories espoused by the scientists in this movie - and some seem to contradict each other, if only slightly - but after you finish the film, your mind should feel like it's been poked in a few new places."}

Based on a series of graphic novels by Frank Miller, Sin City manages to be both provocative and ridiculous, and to achieve the former it requires that the viewer not only suspend disbelief but throw it out of the window of a moving car over a large body of water.\nThe movie is split into three stories that overlap each other slightly: \"The Hard Goodbye,\" \"The Big Fat Kill,\" and \"That Yellow Bastard.\" All of them take place in a mythical hellhole called Basin City, whose appellation is, of course, shortened by all who reference it, given the death and sex and violence and other varied depravities that take place in it.\nIn the first story, Marv (Mickey Rourke) is an ugly, scarred thug who wakes up to find that the girl next to him in bed, Goldie (Jaime King) has been murdered during the night - and that the cops are on their way to get him for the crime. Marv doesn't go quietly, naturally, and vows not to rest until he's found Goldie's killer and avenged her. The second story is about an ex-photographer (Clive Owen) who - with the help of gun-totin', knife-wielding hookers - kills a cop and then has to cover up the crime. And the third story is about an honest-joe cop named Hartigan (Bruce Willis), who saves a little girl from molestation and death - but is himself framed for the crime.\nIf the movie had been presented in realistic animated form, it would have been such an easier sell. When I watch a cartoon, I know that the anvil landing on Wile E. Coyote's head isn't hurting the poor canine. But I do expect that most of the laws of physics should apply - if the coyote throws something into the air, it will indeed come down eventually. When I watch a live-action movie, I expect every one of the laws of physics to apply - or, at least when they don't quite follow those rules, my brain doesn't register it and instead focuses on the nifty special effects.\nBut this movie is kind of stuck in the middle. Marv runs *at* a speeding police car and jumps at it, his legs driving into the windshield. Okay, if that were a cartoon I wouldn't give it a second thought. If it were a live-action movie, I might - unless Marv were some supervillian bent on world domination and his ability to jump into windshields at 80 mph could thus be explained. But because he wasn't - he's just some giant schlub with a lot of scars - my brain immediately did a double take - \"Huh? Wha?\" Aside from logic, there's the dialog itself. In comic books - sorry, graphic novels - the dialog is *supposed* to be melodramatic, even stilted, especially when the story is set in a noirish age (think 1940s New York City). But in a live-action movie, this just plain doesn't work. Indeed, the dialog was completely unconvincing and insincere; it sounded more fitting for the back of a cereal box. Miller's dialog was childish and absurd; at no point did his words allow me to buy into the entire concept of a \"translated\" graphic novel. (Example: On two occasions someone utters, \"Yeesh!\" in reaction to some kinda bloody mess. Who in the world says \"Yeesh\"? Honestly.) The very first scene - a meeting between Hartigan and his partner, Bob (Michael Madsen) was howlingly awful, and I initially thought the dialog was intentionally being exaggerated for (melo)dramatic effect. Then I quickly discovered that the entire movie was going to be like that, that this wasn't some sly commentary about how awful the dialog was in old-time mystery films.\nGiven that Robert Rodiguez co-directed (with Miller) and that Quentin Tarantino was listed as a \"guest director,\" I expected some wit, even if it were in the form of gallows humor. Sadly, none was to be found, and the movie was instead as soulless and empty as the denizens of Sin City itself. The bad guys weren't charming, the good guys weren't normal, and even the reverse wasn't true. No one was likable, which is a good thing in a purportedly gritty crime drama, but neither was anyone unlikeable; the fact is, I didn't care anything about the characters one way or another, and that's a serious misstep on the part of the screenwriter.\nFar too long (124 minutes, but it felt like five hours), Sin City misfired for me on all cylinders. Booze, broads, and bullets (to take a phrase from the film) are all great, but even the explosions and gun-play - not to mention scads of scantily clad women holding said guns - couldn't overcome the vast pile of ineptitude in nearly all aspects of the movie, from casting to dialog to pacing to good IL' fashioned logic. Only saving grace is the excellent cinematography, but it's not enough to rescue an abysmal effort."}

She's seeing a therapist, Dr. Munce (Gary Sinise), but both the doctor and Telly's husband Jim (Anthony Edwards) believe she's completely delusional, and they insist Sam never existed.\nBut Telly happens to run into another parent whose child died in the plane crash that claimed Sam - Ash, the hunky ex-hockey player (Dominic West). Now, two people can't both be delusional about the same thing, can they? (Well, they can, but let's not let that get in the way of our logic.) So, it's why-won't-anyone-believe-me Telly and walking-distillery Ash to Solve the Mystery.\nMoody and brooding, the movie tosses no curveballs at the viewer; you're going to have a pretty good idea of how things'll turn out. As intriguing as the premise is - can a forgotten child be remembered? - the script doesn't really do a heck of a lot with the concept, opting instead to try to wow the audience with wacky (and sometimes irrelevant) CGI effects. There are car chases, things crashing, shots fired, people rising, and people falling. This is all done to distract you from the fact that the plot really doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Some of the things that the characters do will make you scratch your head a little, even if you grant them some leeway for their being in mourning.\nMovies like this bug me a little. If you want to be a psychological mystery/thriller, then your plot ought to be strong enough to hold up under close examination. If you just want to be a brain-dead action movie, then the plot part won't matter - but you should have a simplistic storyline, not a complicated one.\nThe Forgotten should be interesting to conspiracy enthusiasts, since it ties together a couple popular ones to the theme of a mother losing her child. I can see how the premise would have made a good movie, but the film suffers from a propensity on the part of the screenwriter to toss in some action where a furthering of the plot would have served the movie better. Things aren't helped by director Joseph Rubin, who brings the same somber and hopeless tone that he brought to the equally forgettable (pardon the pun) The Good Son (pardon that pun, too, come to think of it).\nAs for the acting, this also should have been a strength, what with such reliable pros as Julianne Moore, Alfre Woodard, Gary Sinise, and Anthony Edwards on board. But Moore seemed even hammy at times, basking in the glow of above-the-title stardom, and the others were nothing more than decorative wallpaper, offering little with the few lines they were given.\nThe Forgotten misses the mark, although not by a whole lot. As far as contemporary thrillers go, it's best not remembered."}

Stuff is oozing along the walls. There's a foul stench. BOth men are chained by the ankle to huge, imposing pipes. And there's a dead man in the middle of the room, laying face down in a pool of slowly drying blood. Neither man knows how he arrived in his present state. Then an unseen killer informs them that one must kill the other by 6 pm that evening - or Lawrence's family will be murdered.\nLawrence and Adam figure out that they've been placed there by a notorious serial killer nicknamed Jigsaw, a psychopath who manipulates his victims into killing each other. The movie dances back and forth in flashbacks to explain what the killer's done in the past (but not, of course, what he plans to do with Lawrence and Adam), which only heightens the suspense.\nSee, this isn't a typical serial-killer movie, wherein your garden-variety Serial Killer Dude picks a theme (Ten Commandments, Seven Deadly Sins, zodiac symbols, alphabet, what have you) and then the scriptwriters get creative with the gore. Uh-uh. Now, don't get me wrong, there's gore in this movie - so shoo the kids and make sure the dog's looking the other way - but so much of the horror is perceived, rather than presented. And that's what I love about Saw. At times, it's inventively icky, but it never dwells on the sicko aspect of the killer's machinations. What it does particularly well, I think, is that it constantly keeps you wondering what's going to happen next - but never satisfying, never letting you settle into a comfort zone. Good horror films make your skin crawl not by how many buckets of blood they can spatter across the screen but by the mere anticipation of them; what's more, the best horror films make you honestly and unequivocally believe that what's happening to the protagonists could happen to you, too.\nI mentioned there's been a surge in horror films, but it's more of a glut of mediocrity.

Think of it as more like Toy Story, with the motley band of lovable personalities banding together to survive and beat the bad guys. But there's a crucial difference between the films: Toys are cute and cuddly, and robots are not. No knock against the animation process used in Robots, but I've had Legos that had more character than some of these bots.\nA notable exception is Williams, doing what Robin Williams does best. Even if everything he said wasn't ad libbed, he makes you feel as if it is - and that's part of his charm. His extroversion wins you over in the part of Fender (\"I used to be bumper, then we moved to the city\"), the robot who's slowly falling apart and is set to be outmoded.\nWhen movies such as Toy Story and A Bug's Life came out, we were wowed by the technologically wonderful animation. But audiences are notoriously fickle; we're now used to computer animation being this good, and so we're not as easily distracted by the effects. The \"sets\" on Robots - especially the elaborate transportation found in Robot City - are fantastic, but it seems they would have been even more impressive if they'd been in a short cartoon. The domino sequence was particularly marvelous to behold.\nAs with most kidlet-appeal movies, Robots tugs hard on your fragile heartstrings. I mean, you know darn well how it's going to end, and you still can't help but feel good when it's over. So the film is successful in that regard. The kids in the theater in which I saw the movie seemed to like it well enough, based on their laughter, but I didn't get a sense that they thought it was as awesome as, say, Toy Story, which probably spoiled everyone for a long while.\nRobots isn't terribly charming or creative in its storyline or characterizations, although the animation is top notch."}

His best friend is Angie (Rene Zellweger), an angel fish with the typical heart o' gold. Angie loves Oscar to death, but he's too dopey and blind to figure that out.\nBut Oscar's the fishie on the spot when he's witness to a descending anchor that kills a shark that was chasing him. Aha, problem solved! You bet it is, especially when Oscar sort of takes credit for the death, proclaiming himself \"Sharkslayer.\" Top of the world, ma! Will Oscar finally realize that Angie is his One True Love, or will he fall to the considerable and formidable charms of the lovely and mysterious Lola (Angelina Jolie)? And will he figure out his romance situation before he's iced by the local Mob boss Don Lino (Robert DeNiro), who happens to be the father of the shark who was killed by the anchor, the shark everyone thinks Oscar killed? Charming, whimsical, and fulla heart and moxie, Shark Tale tries - and succeeds - to do for fishfolk what Antz did for insectfolk. Both, incidentally, were Dreamworks creations, and it's somewhat assuring to see a company other than Disney consistently turn out fun, high-quality animation.\nFor once, Smith is perfectly cast. Don't get me wrong, I've liked quite a few Will Smith films, but most of the time he's an entertainer and showman, not an actor. There's plenty of showmanship in his performance here, but for some reason the animation comes across as completely sincere. So it's the Will Smith show again, but against the animated backdrop of the briny deep, it somehow works wonderfully.\nBearing in mind that during the making of animated films, the actors providing the voices often do not work simultaneously (although they did do so a few times for Shark Tale), I thought the vocal chemistry between De Niro and Smith was excellent. Strong performances abounded, from a fairly disparate selection of actors: De Niro, Smith, Zellweger, Jolie, Peter Falk, Jack Black, Ziggy Marley, and Doug E. Doug.\nSo all in all, a whole lotta fun. You might say the movie has teeth, but you'd be wrong - it's an innocuous PG-rated movie, so rated merely for its mild cartoon violence. Your kidlets will probably love it - or at least they will if there's a Happy Meal involved, which I'm sure there was."}

But they're not typical stoners, either; Harold is an investment banker, and Kuman is a medical whiz whose father is trying to get into med school. So although they're lovable losers who just wanna get high, the boys aren't complete slackers, either.\nThe movie deals with the duo's journey one evening to White Castle and the various wild (and increasingly unlikely) events that befall them during their travels. Funny thing is, most people can probably relate to this, putting aside the drug portion of the program. You remember your college years, right? Didn't you ever take a road trip somewhere, just on a whim? You could, back then. Sure, you'd think nothing more of trekking up to Niagara Falls, 14 hours away, for a weekend. You didn't have responsibilities back then, so it was cool.\nAnyway, when Harold and Kumar discover that the White Castle burger joint they thought was nearby has been gone for five years, they decide to drive 45 minutes to lovely, elite Cherry Hill, New Jersey, where the closest WC resides. Along the way, they stop off at Princeton University to try to score weed and hot babes, run into surf punk jerkos who harass them at every opportunity, take the police on a wild chase, get incarcerated, bust out of jail, and even meet Neil Patrick Harris, he of the long-gone Doogie Howser show.\nAll in one night.\nIt's a justifiably ludicrous scenario, and yet its implausibility is what works so strongly for it. For crying out loud, they ride a cheetah! They hang glide! Just the anticipation of What Might Happen Next is enough to keep all but the most apathetic of viewers from giving a rat's buttocks.\nThrough all the chaos, Harold and Kumar don't always see eye to eye - just like in real life. Each fights the other from time to time, with blame for their current predicament being concentrated like rage in an anarchist. But though they're bickering and sniping, we know that Harold and Kumar will be there for each other through it all and will - we fervently hope - survive the night to feast on White Castle hamburgers and fries.\nThere are a few reasons that this movie might not appeal to everyone. There are drug references. There's nudity. There's profanity. And there's the fact that zillions of people have never even heard of White Castle, let alone had one of its famous (infamous?) burgers. White Castle burgers are known for their small size and affordability, making them favorites of college kids. Hey, you can buy a SACK of White Castle Sliders. How cool is that? A sack of burgers! Cho and Penn are appealing as the titular duo, charming but not self-aggrandizing. Doubtless a lot of people watched the movie and said to themselves, \"Dude! I know that guy!\" And indeed I did. I knew a guy who's a dead ringer for Kumar. Absolutely down to every fiber of his personality. So for me, the movie was pleasantly familiar.\nDo Harold and Kumar make it to their Shangri-La, their Mecca, their holies of holy lands, White Castle? Well, maybe. But as perhaps they could tell you, it's the puff that's the most fun, not the exhaling."}

Unwittingly, Karen discovers the presence of murderous, vengeful ghosts, bent on destroying anyone who enters the house - and then passing along their plague to their loved ones.\nThere's a legend in Japan, you see, that says that when a person dies in a state of sorrow or rage, that emotion remains behind to haunt others. Can Karen escape the curse and prevent it from ensnaring her boyfriend Doug? Whoa, not so fast, there. This is Buffy the Vampire Slayer, here, true, but she's not Superman. Surely Karen can't topple an ancient curse, right? Horror movies are all the rage now, which is good. Even better, the emphasis seems to be on suspense as much as it's on gore and whatnot. The Grudge trucks with the former much more than with the latter, which is also a good thing. It's an amusing, entertaining little film, and there's no slight intended. Rather than overwhelm the viewer's senses with loud noises and blood, director Takashi Shimizu opts instead for what lurks around the corner and under the bed. Yes, you do see some gross things (including an undead being that looks like it walked off the set of The Ring), but watching the movie isn't like stepping into a house of horrors in which what you see is what's scary. As with the scariest movies, what you don't see can kill you.\nGellar is pretty good, considering she's been in movies like I Know What You Did Last Summer. The Grudge is leagues ahead of crappy teenyboppers-in-peril movies like that one (and Scream 2, in which Gellar also appeared), in terms of both style and story. Really, it's like the difference between Scooby Doo and Columbo. Sure, it's a fairly easy gig, playing a victim in a horror movie. And, of course, if you're pretty much the only \"name\" actor in the movie, chances are pretty good that your character is going to survive it, in one form or another. Even so, I was pleasantly surprised at how well Gellar essayed her character's abject terror, so kudos to her.\nReally, if I hadn't already seen The Ring, I might have thought this was even better than it turned out to be - although I did think it turned out better than I had anticipated. It might seem a little derivative of The Ring to folks out there, but it seems to have derived only the good stuff."}

Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) has committed an unspeakable crime, the stabbing of the retarded younger brother of his ex-girlfriend Becky (Jena Malone). No one, least of all Leland himself, can explain why he's done what he's done, whether the act was premeditated or spontaneous, done out of hatred or love.\nIn the detention center, Leland meets Pearl Madison (Don Cheadle), a onetime novel writer who sees in Leland's case a second opportunity. But Pearl also wants to understand Leland's motivation and takes him under his wing as a confidante in the prison.\nThe film jumps from the past to the present several times, often allowing the past to act as a context to the present, and vice versa. Writer/director Matthew Ryan Hodge shows how Leland's crime - and the events leading up to it - affect the people in his life, from Becky to her family to Leland's mother (Lena Olin) and estranged father (Kevin Spacey) to Allen (Chris Klein), a young man who is staying with Becky's family after the death of his own mother.\nThe chief asset in the movie is Gosling, who is perfectly cast as the 15-year-old pseudopsychopath. Like Bartleby the Scrivener, Gosling's Leland just exists; he shows little emotion during the film, but instead his expressions belie an ocean of guilt, sadness, love, and rage.\nEach of the main actors offered perhaps their best work to date, save Spacey (who's not exactly a novice). Special praise is due to Malone and Klein, two young performers who are better known for lighthearted comedy fare than the heavy drama of this movie.\nAnother huge benefit in terms of the story is that none of the characters is flawless; none are heroes out to save the day.

As with any other action/adventure/sci-fi hodge-podge, the plot might not stand up to close scrutiny, but my interest was surely held over its two-hour running time, which is no mean feat. Diesel may not be John Wayne (yet), but he's got this role down pat already. Dench adds class where class is needed (although she's not on screen enough), and Feore makes a suitable villain.

You can almost feel the actors breathing on you.\nThat's about it as far as positives go. \"Horror\" might have worked if it had been played as a parody of those old films. Instead, it took itself completely seriously; instead of mocking, it was mockable.

I spit on it!", "content": "It should come as no shock to you when I say that Alone in the Dark is a crappy movie. To put it bluntly, it's as if a dung monster defecated, ate the result, and then vomited. The final product would still outshine this movie.\nSeemingly based on an ancient (!) Atari video game, the movie has something or other to do with a portal to the bowels of the earth, the unleashing of demons, and ancient civilizations. Something about there being two worlds, that of darkness and that of light. (Guess which one's ours.) Oh, and 10,000 years ago a really super-duper advanced civilization opened the portal, demons came over and had a blast, then wiped out the civilization. Which is why we've never heard of them, conveniently enough.\nChristian Slater, perhaps pining for the days of Heathers and Pump up the Volume, plays Edward Carnby, a paranormal researcher to whom Something Bad happened when he was 10 years old. He's hot on the trail of one of the artifacts of said advanced civilization. Carnby used to be part of a secret institution called 713, which has been trying to figure out what happened to that long-ago civilization. But Carnby believed he wasn't going to be able to find the answers he sought, so he left the group.\nBut see, these beasties are out, and they get their prey in varying ways, such as gutting them, splitting them down the middle, implanting neurological control devices in them, or just turning them into killing zombies. Yes, it's another zombie movie.\nThat's about as distilled I can make the plot. It's pretty convoluted and incomprehensible. In similar movies, one might see the intrepid researcher/adventurer figure things out a step at a time, and when we the audience are mentally with the researcher, it's a lot of fun. But when the scenes shift from attack to attack with no perspective or context... not so much fun.\nThe acting is dreadful, save for Slater, who (although he almost seems embarrassed to be in the movie) showed he was capable of carrying the acting load. He had to; get this - Tara Reid is cast as a museum curator! Honest to goodness, I thought I'd seen the casting of a lifetime when Denise Richards was cast as a nuclear physicist in Tomorrow Never Dies. But Reid here matches Richards, crappy emoting for crappy emoting. Hightlights include Reid pronouncing \"Newfoundland\" as \"New Fownd Land,\" Reid delivering most of her lines in a dazed, throaty monotone (kinda like she'd been on an all-night bender for the past week before filming), Reid - a museum curator, mind you - spending a lot of the movie in a midriff-bearing top and hip-hugger jeans. Oh yeah, she was as believable as Jessica Simpson giving stock quotes. Oh, why must the pretty ones be so dumb? (Note: I don't think Tara Reid's all that good looking. She looks like she's in perpetual need of food.) Almost everyone else in the cast is completely forgettable, except perhaps for Steven Dorff, who played Burke, one of the leaders of 713. Dorff's character wasn't terribly well developed, but nothing in the movie was, from the sets to the characters to Tara Reid. But I digress.\nAnyway, the perplexing and utterly preposterous storyline is tough enough to follow with the film moving at such a breakneck pace, but director Uwe Boll tosses in a pounding, mind-deadening soundtrack; it's so loud you can't hear what the actors are saying in some of the scenes! That can't be right. Given the acting level, however, perhaps thanks are in order to Mr. Boll.\nOh, and a fun note. The opening moments of the movie include narration... of the words that are crawling across the screen at the same time. Remember the first Star Wars? You heard that now-familiar Star Wars theme while the prologue crawled. There was surely no need for narration; why do I need some doofus to read what's on the screen for me? Were the producers simply looking out for blind people? Maybe that also explains why the soundtrack was so loud - they were also looking out for hard-of-hearing people. Also, the narrator inexplicably had a lisp for the first few lines of the crawl - then lost it. Bizarre.\nAlone in the Dark is a loud, dopey mishmash of dreadful acting, an incoherent script, and ham-handed directing. Hardly a note rings true. There's so much chaos that the audience simply gives up caring about the characters and roots for their demise. Even in the dark, the demonic creatures seem cooler and much more developed by comparison.\nIronically, since there were only three other people in the theater, I watched this Alone in the Dark. I wonder if Uwe Boll planned it that way? I can't quite give this the lowest rating, because I had low hopes for it to begin with - and because it never grabbed me enough for me to get worked up about it. It's atrocious, although Slater redeems himself a tiny bit."}

This was in 1990. For fanboys, it's been a long 14 years.\nHaving seen one other crossover movie (Freddy versus Jason!), I wasn't too stoked for this one. When you take two movies that have their own histories and mush them together into the same movie, there are going to be some inconsistencies.\nI'm not a fanboy of either series, so I can't speak to the movie's accuracy in that sense. All I know is that Alien = bad (i.e., attacks humans) and Predator = bad (i.e., attacks humans).\nThe basic story here is that a group of scientists discovers an ancient pyramid in Antarctica, and when they explore it they find themselves in a battle between the Aliens and the Predators. Place your bets, kids! The over/under on bloodshed is forty gallons; the Predators are favored by 19 vats of slime.\nAs with all disparate casts, the expedition is composed of scientists from varying backgrounds: a mechanical engineer, a couple of archaeologists, a mountain climber/guide, and do forth. Oh, and men with guns. Their mission is to get to the pyramid and see what's what. Leading them is Lex Woods (Sanaa Lathan); she's a tough, strong leader. You know right away she'll make it through this ordeal alive, because much of the pre-expedition focus is on her. You know, to endear her to the audience. Other characters are given short shrift by comparison.\nNeat little trivium: Lance Henriksen, who was in a couple of the Alien movies, here plays industrial billionaire Charles Weyland, whose company found the pyramid and is financing the expedition. Lance looks pretty haggard. I mean, he always did, but now he looks like Clint Eastwood before Clint got his Botox injections. But I digress.\nAnyway, long story short - they get there, find Aliens have attacked the previous expedition (from 1904!), and then all hell breaks loose as everyone has to fight to survive.\nThere are plenty of good things to say about this movie. For one thing, the set design and special effects are fantastic, making the viewer forget the pedestrian plot and the shallow characters. Come to think of it, though, the characters really aren't all that shallow, compared with other recent sci-fis. Take Supernova or Event Horizon. No, seriously, take them. Same idea - heterogeneous crew, Something Evil afoot - and yet the effects weren't good enough to distract us from the crappy dialogue. In AvP, there aren't many memorable lines (if any), but it didn't matter.\nAnd here's why. By now, we all know what the Predator looks like (seen near the end of P2). And we've always known what the Alien's looked like. So there was no sense in keeping either hidden from view. This is Alien versus Predator, so let's see 'em fight! And fight they did, with our feckless humans stuck in the middle. This time, since we've seen some of what either species can do, some human characteristics are attributed to them, particularly the Predators, (yes, Predators plural), such as War paint, honor, and rituals.\nAvP is a very diverting, action-packed movie - there aren't any slow moments, and it follows through on its own premise."}

The trail leads the intrepid duo from land to the sky to the sea and back again, often in Joe's amazing fighter plane.\nThe story is told in the tradition of 1940's-era serials, complete with an evil mastermind, cliffhangers (and plenty of them), whiz-bang effects, and a paper-thin script. People die, although there's no blood shed. In fact, since this is a PG-rated film, much of the violence takes place offscreen.\nThe movie plays heavily on the futuristic fears of the past. Perhaps you can remember reading The War of the Worlds for the first time, or even hearing Orson Welles' production of it in 1938. Comics at the time - and even into the fifties - spoke of robots and alien encounters on a purely sci-fi basis; now they belong more in the realm of reality. Science-fiction movies of yesteryear preyed on the fear of the unknown. Since everyday people were less inclined to be as technologically as they are today, science could be portrayed as the root of all evils - or the solution to them. Back then, one could easily imagine a fleet of flying robots, or an amphibious airplane, or a rocket ship of doom.\nJude Law is aces as Joe, the Sky Captain of the title. Joe is fearless, shrewd, daring, smart, and charming - everything one would expect to see in a hero in an oldtime movie serial. If there's a solution, the audience knows somehow Joe will find it. Indiana Jones, remember, was cast in the same basic mold, and I think the characterization holds up today - unlike so much else from the old serials. Kudos are also due to Angelina Jolie, an RAF commander and former colleague/flame of Joe. Jolie has limited screen time (about twenty minutes or so), but she certainly makes the most of it. Hers was probably the strongest performance of the cast; compelling, vibrant, and dominating. She looked right for the role, too, complete with black eye patch to mask her exquisite looks.\nTo balance out the fantastic work turned in by Law and Jolie, Paltrow phones in an absolutely horrid performance that wasn't helped at all by a poor script. But see, good actresses should be able to overcome bad scripts, at least to some degree. Paltrow's Polly started out smart and appealing, but that facade was quickly lifted, and she became a snippy, annoying, selfish witch. (This is a family-oriented review, so I'll refrain from strong language.) It's important to understand that the scripts and plots of oldtime serials weren't exactly Annie Hall, but somehow Law and Jolie were able to rise above their transparent lines and give commanding performances. Paltrow looked way out of her league; I was openly rooting for her to die. That's hardly ever good for a leading lady, you'd think. But alas and alack, since this is patterned after oldtime serials, that sort of ending was never very likely.\nThe overall writing is actually quite good, at least in terms of the plot. Watch Indiana Jones, for example, and you'll notice the plot whisks you along without your having to stop and consider what might happen next. Sky Captain does this as well, traveling from exotic locale to exotic locale, from set piece to set piece without a pause. That's the good feature of the writing. The bad is that all in all, the characterizations aren't very deep; they're simple characters for a simple time. You know, to put it simply. (Polly utters a \"goddamn!\" at one point, but is too ashamed later to say \"naked.\" Weird.) But beyond the acting and the writing, the one aspect that overshadows all in its gosh-darn, gee-whiz-bang awe are the special effects. The entire movie was shot against a blue screen; everything except the main characters was computer generated. That's pretty amazing, really; the computerized scenery blends so seamlessly with the actors (for the most part) that one easily forgets their origin. Paltrow's performance at times made my brain hiccup a little, as it tried to reconcile her actions with the background. The actors had some idea of what they were supposed to be doing, but essentially they acted in front of a blue screen, and then they were digitally added to the existing footage. Since the movie wasn't shot on a set, exactly, there's a scene at the beginning that made me hesitate a little: Polly is trying to take a picture of the invading robots, and she drops her camera (of course). As she tries to rescue it from a drain, she doesn't seem particularly afraid of the hundreds-of-feet-tall rampaging robots. This is just poor acting on the part of Paltrow.\nWell cast, and somewhat well written, Sky Captain is an homage to and revival of those old wild-eyed sci-fi classics, the ones that made you gaze in wonderment toward the skies and to the future."}

They've become so commonplace that their morality are never in question, thanks to the Three Rules of Robots, which prevent a robot from causing harm to humans.\nNot everyone's drinking the robot kool-aid, though. Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith), who hates robots with a passion, is assigned to a case in which a preeminent robotics scientist (James Cromwell) appeared to have jumped through a window many, many stories up, splattering himself all over the lobby of his office building. Grimacing and muttering all the while, Spooner sets out to investigate what seems like a suicide. But our intrepid hero - as well as 99.9999% of the viewing audience - thinks something else is afoot.\n(Which reminds me. In movies such as this, look at what the lead character does and says when we first meet him. Rarely are lines said for the sake of natural feel; they all Mean Something to the plot, however small.) The beauty of megabad movies is that they offer so much fodder for humor. For example, nearly every character is a caricature, from the tough-love police lieutenant (Chi McBride, typecast) to the cute-intellectual female scientist to Spooner's wise and doting grandmother. The makers of this crap could have just used cardboard cutouts with the stereotype written on them in permanent marker.\nAs Spooner unearths more evidence and more people become convinced he's losing his mind, the audience is relegated to counting the clich\u00e9s and the cereal-box writing. I swear, if I hear Smith say, \"Oh HELL no!\" in one more movie, I'm gonna upchuck my Milk Duds. His wisecracks are neither wise nor cracky. At one point, his lieutenant kicks him off the force, asking him for his badge. And just his badge - he's allowed to keep his gun. Good thing, because he needed it for the rest of the movie, as it turned out.\nThe plot is nonsensical if one looks at it too closely. Guy dies. Cop blames a robot. Everyone else blames guy and laughs at the cop, who has a history of violence against robots. Who's right? Who cares, anyway? It's all a soulless, turgid mountain gibberish. There's not an honest or original thought in the movie. You'll be several jumps ahead of the criminally stupid Spooner. In real life, Spooner would have been gutted by his fellow humans; he wouldn't be able to make a dopey analytical statement and then follow it with a high-larious side-splitting witticism without being drawn and quartered. Or so one would hope.\nThe only saving grace is the effects. 2035 (not too far from now, kiddies!) looks like a pretty cool place to be, much more so than most futures look on the silver screen. There's no post apocalyptic nightmare. No marauding bands of hellions looking for water, or dry land, or both. Everything looks gee-whiz-bang; in the middle of them is Spooner as anachronism, complete with Converse sneakers, a stereo that works by remote and not verbal commands, and manual driving. You know, rather than letting those bad IL' robots drive.\nBut see, this is old news. Go watch Demolition Man (1993). Instead of Bridget Moynahan in this one, you'd get Sandra Bullock. And instead of Will Smith, you'd get real action stars, like Sly Stallone and Wesley Snipes. And it's more fun, because it never takes itself too seriously. This movie does, even though it's far more style than substance. The underlying problem here is that director Alex Proyas and writers Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldsman chose to use 2004 sensibilities and behavior in a movie set in 2035.\nI, Robot is a bottomless pit of dung. There, I said it. This movie is like graffitti in the otherwise-respectable wall of Will Smith's career. But what I, Robot teaches us, boys and girls, is that Will Smith is not so much an actor as a Movie Star. He's resplendent in all of his Smithisms; all that's missing is a white guy to whom Smith can impart sage advice."}

Pilager's manager, Chuck Raven hires Danny O'Brien to investigate, thinking an old enemy of Pilager is trying to sabotage the campaign. O'Brien soon finds out that the gig isn't as easy as it looks, and soon he has more questions than suspects.\nDirector John Sayles' jab at George Walker Bush and his political campaign comes off as lightweight fluff, particularly because Sayles' scripts are usually so poignant and barbed. This one seems so defanged, it feels as if it originally aired as a made-for-television movie. At first, the viewer thinks he's in for a treat of thinly veiled references to political glad-handing, the spoils system, and other double-dealings. But sadly, it's just not meant to be. Sayles' story is nothing more than a who-killed-so-and-so movie with politics as a (somewhat distant) background.\nThe movie's biggest flaw, though, is in the casting of the lead role, O'Brien. Sayles chose Danny Huston, son of John, grandson of Walter, and half-brother of Anjelica. Huston has all of 18 credits on the Internet Movie Database, most of them minor roles. His lack of experience is sorely evident here; his character is at times annoying, charming, eager, and jaded. It's as if Huston couldn't quite decide how his character was supposed to react from scene to scene. As a result - and especially since he's working for the proverbial bad guys from the beginning - the audience isn't really sure whether they should be rooting for him or not. A sure bad omen for a film is a lead character about him the audience is at best ambivalent.\nAnother debit is the sheer quantity of characters; there are so many recognizable actors who have small roles that you tend to forget who they were the next time they appeared on screen. In addition to Dreyfuss (who has a few scenes, and chews them up), Michael Murphy, Mary Kay Place, Daryl Hannah, James Gammon, Tim Roth, Miguel Ferrer, and Kris Kristofferson pop on and offscreen like hiccups. In a way, Silver City is more reminiscent of a Robert Altman movie than a John Sayles movie, except for the shorter running time.\nI was never drawn into the mystery of the dead body, or the political machinations, or even the human aspect (Pilager is portrayed as dumb as a post), so for me the movie failed to deliver. Silver City was a real disappointment to me; in this day of skewering politicians, and considering Sayles' usual crisp writing, it falls fall short of the mark. Impeach it"}

Andrew is numb to everything, least of all his mother's death, owing in no small part to the constant stream of medication he's been on most of his life. While at home, he hooks up with some old friends, including Mark (Peter Sarsgaard), and finds a new friend, Sam (Natalie Portman).\nAndrew's struggle to find himself, to find out where he is, where he's going, and how to deal with what may come, is at the nexus of the story; his mother's funeral is simply a gateway to strong introspection. At 26 years old, Andrew is past the point in his life where he can count on the future to solve his problems - he has to decide in the here and now how he will handle the problems he'll encounter.\nA major catalyst in Andrew's journey is Sam, a young lady who appears to have at least as many psychological problems as Andrew does. Can Andrew depend on Sam to be his rock of sanity? Or is she more unstable and therefore unreliable? This is also a movie about relationships: Andrew's with Sam, Andrew's with Mark and other old friends, and Andrew's with his dad (Ian Holm). For each of his relationships, Andrew must decide to some degree whether he wishes to remain a reactor or to become a actor.\nThere's also unfinished business between Andrew and his father, especially regarding Andrew's mother. He has not been home since being sent to boarding school nine years prior, and understandably communication between the two has been rather strained for many years. The death of Andrew's mother serves as an impetus for them to find a way to reconcile.\nThe film has generated a lot of praise among critics, and it was nominated for a Grand Jury prize at the 2004 Sundance festival. In my opinion, the hype matches the product. Garden State is understated and powerful at the same time, a very tough trick to pull off for anyone, least of all a rookie director; Braff wrote and directed the movie as well as starred in it, and all accolades are well deserved. His Andrew is archetypal for the prodigal son, as well as for the young adult who hasn't yet grown up.\nSarsgaard is aces as the dreaming and scheming, hedonistic Mark. And you have to admire someone who refuses to take money - even as a loan - instead opting for somewhat-illegal means. But through and through, he's a strong friend to Andrew.\nPortman still looks too young for grownup roles, even though she's now 23 years old. Still, despite her small stature, she ably pulls off what's really a complex role in Sam. Portman manages somehow to look adorable and serious at the same time; if one squints, one can see the sincerity behind her eyes.\nClever, complex, and utterly charming, Garden State is a real treat, thanks to a tight script and spot-on performances. The excellent soundtrack, produced by Braff, is icing."}

It's a perfect complement to (or substitute for, depending on your outlook) 28 Days Later or Dawn of the Dead, the two most recent zombie movies.\nShaun (Simon Pegg) is a salesman at a small electronics store. He lives with flatmates Ed (Nick Frost) and Pete (Peter Serafinowicz) and hangs out with his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) at the local pub, the Winchester. Shaun's life is pretty stagnant at this point. He's 28 but directionless. Liz notices this problem and tells him to take a hike after Shaun bungles the reserving of a table for dinner. Dazed, Shaun gets drunk at the Winchester with Ed. It's not until after a few days of their bender that Shaun and Ed notice the walking dead.\nThe zombies are more or less a metaphor for Shaun's life to that point; that he's just drifting from experience to experience without actually making anything of himself. He likes Ed, but he can't rely on him as a friend (Ed is also jobless); no one else in his social circle can stand Ed. Liz's flatmates don't like Shaun too much, because they think he neglects her. But Shaun isn't dislikable, he's just not all that.. there.\nThe arrival of the living dead - their genesis is never explained, but it's moot - gives Shaun a chance to show he's not some senseless slacker who'd rather play video games or hang around in a pub. And it's at this point that the movie mirrors the earlier, more-serious zombie films, as he and his friends try to escape the clutches of the zombies.\nShaun's personality doesn't change drastically, however; it's not as if he's suddenly transformed into Indiana Jones. He makes mistakes, but one thing is certain - Shaun. He appears full of life and confidence, inspiring his followers to .. well, to follow.\nGoing from the promos, one would think this was full of nonstop laughs. Now, there were plenty of moments when I did laugh out loud, but a lot of the movie - especially the final 30 minutes or so - is fairly serious. Lighter than your usual run-of-the-mill living-dead movie, but not a hilarious film full of wacky hijinks. In some respect, that may have hurt the movie a little - people crack jokes when it seems more drama would be in order. And some of the characters are pretty darn unlikeable, and that never helps unless they're definitely the bad guys."}

Small problem, though: Turns out Vincent's deals are actually hits. That might cost extra on the meter.\nMichael Mann's dark action film is mainly a two-character study of the hijacked Max and the confident Vincent. Will Max ever get the psychological upper hand on Vincent? Who will win out? Will Vincent complete his \"rounds\"? The other characters are merely background decorations, for the most part, as this is a batter of wits between a cold master and a warm, pensive dreamer.\nCritics have raved about this movie, especially about Foxx's performance and about Cruise's ability to disappear into a character. I can't agree with the latter of those two assessments. To me, Tom Cruise never stopped being Tom Cruise. You can whiten his beard and give him a salt-and-pepper mane, but you can never completely take away the very distinct Cruise mannerisms. You can never, in other words, completely forget Vincent is Tom Cruise, Movie Star, and that's where the movie really suffers. I believe Cruise was miscast in this movie, because another, less-mannered actor would have given a much more-nuanced performance.\nFoxx, on the other hand, was perfectly cast, and this (along with Ray) is surely a breakthrough role for the former In Living Color vet. Foxx immerses himself so much in his character that one completely empathizes with Max's plight. We understand when he's uncertain about calling Annie, the lawyer who was the fare before Vincent. We know where he's coming from when he's asked to do reprehensible things by Vincent over the course of the long evening. We never have to stop and ask ourselves why Max is doing something, or - more appropriately - why Max isn't doing something to stop Vincent.\nThere are some holes in the story itself, which never bodes well when the movie is as plot dependent; even worse, though, is that the plot - particularly the ending - seems far too contrived and tidy for the people involved. Things happen in the movie that would be considered mere coincidences in real life, but here they look manipulated.\nBecause of this, Collateral was a disappointment to me. Even if one sawed through the hype of the movie (\"Ooh look! It's Tom Cruise looking old!\") and took it at face value, the plot contrivances and hamminess of Cruise ultimately sink it, at least to some degree. It's not a wholly unentertaining movie, as it's fun to watch Cruise and Foxx interact. It's just not as satisfying as it should have been."}

He has no friends, he's picked on by bullies, he has a somewhat-odd home life ... but through it all, he's sure things will be just plain okay in the end.\nNapoleon and his older brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) live with their grandmother, but at the beginning of the film she tells them she needs to take off for a couple days. Enter their Uncle Rico (Jon Gries), a self-starter who's living in 1982 (when the coach of his high school football team declined to put him in as quarterback, thus altering Rico's life forever). Some of the funniest scenes in the film involve Napoleon's often-combative relationship with Uncle Rico; Rico is also bound and determined to return to those halcyon days of his youth via a time machine he's seen advertised on the Internet, and he enlists Kip to help him raise the funds.\nNapoleon befriends the new kid in school, Pedro (Efren Ramirez), who has a sweet bike, can talk to girls, and has an actual mustache. But like Napoleon, Pedro is a misfit. Both sometimes hang out with yet another taciturn student, Deb (Tina Majorino, all grown up from Waterworld), who secretly (it seems) likes Napoleon. But there isn't a lot of focus on their relationship, because Napoleon himself is fairly oblivious to how people perceive him. This isn't a story about young love or lust, it's a story about a misfit refusing to fit - while fitting in with others like him.\nJon Heder is perfectly cast as the gawky, dorky Napoleon; he resembles Butt-Head in countenance, although certainly not in temperament or intelligence. Mouth agape and with an awkward gait, Napoleon is about as odd a duck as you'd find in high school, and yet he still manages to survive with his dignity intact. He's a good egg, although he seems to overreact at times: \"What are you gonna do today, Napoleon? Napoleon: Whatever I feel like I wanna do.....GOSH!\" Still, his delivery is perfect. You can readily picture a Napoleon in any high school.\nI think where the film ultimately succeeds, aside from the casting of Heder, is that it doesn't fall into the traps of predictability and stereotyping. Sure, it's a high school movie, and there are snobby pretty girls and arrogant jocks, but not much time is devoted to them. Sure, there's a big dance, but it doesn't necessarily turn out the way you'd expect it to. What you're left with, then, isn't a typical coming-of-age story, but rather a unique take on a rather mundane - albeit life-altering - time in a boy's life."}

Who's trying to kill Jason? Another former agent? The mob? The U.S. government? Bourne wants answers, and the improbable path seems to lead to the CIA and a now-dormant super-duper-secret organization.\nThe CIA wants to kill Bourne, because they believe he killed two of their agents. Bourne, as in the first film, still needs to know who he is, who's trying to kill him, and the relevance of the name Treadstone.\nFans of the first movie will likely enjoy this second film, but fans of the second book (by Robert Ludlum, don't ya know) will be mystified, since the movie takes only a few basic elements from the book. Which is a shame, in my estimation, because the second book was pretty well packed with action and intrigue. The movie makes up for this by including a quite lengthy car chase during the final third of the film.\nPerhaps a different director (Paul Greengrass instead of Doug Liman, who executive produced) explains the change in pacing and tone; Bourne seems the same, which is good, but less seems explained, which is bad. Also, the action scenes are so fast cutting that it's sometimes impossible to tell what's going on.\nDamon still looks the part, and he does a very good job in the role. We don't see enough of Franka Potente, unfortunately, but we do get to see the great Joan Allen as the CIA official out to get Bourne. The ending's a bit too pat, rendering a lot of the plot meaningless. All in all, it's a good time waster, just not as engrossing as the original"}

In other words, for the first movie in a supposed franchise, you have to allow time for exposition of the protagonist's background, even if millions already know him from another medium.\nWith S-M 2, though, such an obligation isn't necessary. We've met Spidey, MJ, Aunt May, et al., and we're ready to jump into a new story. So while the first one explains why Spidey is, the second movie devotes more time to fighting the Bad Guy du Jour, Doctor Octopus.\nPeter Parker (Tobey Maguire) still pines for MJ (Kirsten Dunst), from whom he steers clear despite his undying affection for her. It's for her own good, he tells himself. If we're together, my enemies will top at nothing to get at me through her, and I can't put her in that position. And so, in typical superhero fashion, he broods and broods and broods. The relentless push-and-pull between his love for MJ and his devotion to using his powers for good is a constant theme in the Spider-Man universe, and in the movies it either smolders in the background or charges with a raging fury to the forefront. Peter is given the impossible choice - true love or good deeds - and it's a choice to which, at its core, everyday people can relate; we all have exceedingly difficult choices to make throughout our lives.\nAnd in this especially, the movies succeed. Peter Parker is supposed to be an average teen - well, except for those powers he has. He's not morally superior. He's not smarter. He's just a poor schlub who accidentally has these super powers, and he doesn't quite know how to deal with them. On a smaller scale, a comparison can be made to a supremely talented collegiate football player who's just made it to the pros. He has otherworldly talents. He has money, fame, fortune. And can he handle it? About as well as Peter can.\nAnyway, the big villain here is the aforementioned Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), yet another in a long line of Good Scientists Gone Wrong. You may recall that the Green Goblin from the first S-M movie was also of this line. This Doc has found a way to manipulate metallic tentacles with his mind. (It helps that the tentacles are physically attached to him.) Something goes wrong, he goes mad, and next thing you know it, he's gonna take over the world. Give these boys a Happy Meal, and they'd still want two prizes.\nAlong with the inevitable Spidey-Doc Ock battles, Peter Parker's best friend Harry (James Franco) is still quite resentful as Spidey's killing of his father in the first movie. He doesn't know Peter is Spider-Man, but he knows only Peter is able to take photographs of him. So the second thematic struggle is within Harry - does he resent his friend for knowing the murderer (in his eyes) of his father? All of the cast returns from the first movie (well, all that survived the first movie), and they all do a collective good job. Maguire is a perfect choice for the lead; he's unassuming, can't really emote, is stoic, and even a little bit wimpy. All are qualities that plague the characters of both Spider-Man and Peter Parker."}

She's content, Elastigirl is, although she doesn't like it when the family has to move - again - because Bob got fired from another job, usually owing to the use of his superduper powers.\nSo one day when Bob gets a message from a supersecret organization that wants him to thwart an evil robot that can learn from its own mistakes... well, Bob sees no reason to mention it to Helen. Or that he was just fired from his crappy job. Nope, he decides that the company is sending him out of town for a \"conference.\" Will Mr. Incredible indeed save the day? Or will Elastigirl (and crew) have to save his sorry butt for him?\nThis Pixar film was a little uneven for my tastes. The first half of the movie dragged noticeably; this half didn't seem very well paced at all. In fact, I even committed the cardinal sin of checking my watch a few times - that's how dull it was. But during the second half, things really picked up. The action was much more ubiquitous, with some of the most eye-popping scenes in animation. Scenes that made one forget that the movie was animated, which is basically the point of the Pixar animators.\nBut because of the slow first half, this movie didn't charm me as much as previous Pixar films had effortlessly done. In fact, the difference between the two halves of the movie is so stark it almost seems as if two directors were responsible for the movie. \nThere are also a few emotionally strong scenes that your youngest kidlets might not be too fond of, aside from the cartoon violence. There is a scene in which Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl argue loudly, a scene that might hit a little close to home for some children. And because animation is looking more and more realistic, it may be more difficult for kids to see this as a cartoon rather than a live-action movie, to a certain degree, so even scenes of typical cartoon-superhero violence might be a little intense. As it is, this is Pixar's first PG-rated movie, so be warned."}

He's just broken up with a longtime live-in love. He's kind of mopey, kind of aimless, the sort to whom perhaps three-quarters of single thirtysomething males can relate. In short, he's a bit of a loser. He can't even look women in the eye, and in one insightful bit of narration wonders why he falls in love with every woman he meets. But then he meets Clementine (Kate Winslet), who's really like no other woman Joel's ever seen. Heck, she's not like many women, period. Clementine clearly dances to her own drummer.\nBut Joel and Clementine have their share of problems. He's mousy and reserved, she's wild and alcoholic. Sure, opposites attract - they also get into screaming matches. Or not, in Joel's case. At any rate, after Joel visits Clementine at work and she doesn't recognize him (!), he stumbles onto an stunning fact: Clementine has willingly had all memories of Joel erased from her mind. \nWhoa, hold me. This alone is enough to give me an aneurysm. After mulling it over, Joel decides to do the same. Hey, she did it first, so it's OK - right? So he undergoes the procedure. But did it work completely? If so, why does he recognize Clementine sometimes, others not? Why does he relive some of the memories? Is this live, or is this Memorex?\nThe problem is that while Joel is undergoing the process, he decides he doesn't want to forget Clementine - not now, not ever - so he begins to hide her away in parts of his mind where the good doctor and his crew cannot reach. That's all well and good, but now those memories are altered as well, and Joel must outrace his memory erasers in order to preserve his sanity and his love for Clementine.\nKudos all around for the cast. Jim Carrey can indeed act, in case some of you weren't sure. He was fantastic in The Truman Show, and he's fantastic here. You see none of the typical Carrey gawking and mugging, and you see all the tenderness and fears of a scared young man. Winslet is pretty good as Clementine, vacillating between cute vixen to unstable alkie pretty seamlessly. A good supporting cast (Tom Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood) helps tremendously.\nEternal Sunshine was cowritten by one Charlie Kaufman, who's famed for writing unique films, such as Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. Sure, there are flaws here and there, but the writing is so crisp and sincere and flows so easily that it's very tough to condemn any aspect of it.\nIf I have any real complaint about the movie, it's that it was perhaps a little too long. At one hour 48 minutes, it's not a marathon, but some parts near the end did seem to drag a big. This is perhaps owing to a rather pertinent subplot involving Dunst's and Wilkinson's characters, but it's a diversion well met."}

Come to think of it, that was the theme of the first one as well. \nShrek and Fiona journey to the land of Far, Far Away, where the stuffy king and the queen mum live.

Bush's first term, particularly since the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, has been deeply flawed. Moore examines the handling of terrorism in the months prior to September 11, the president's reaction to the attacks, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq overall. Moore leaves very few stones unturned in his thorough dissertation of U.S. foreign policy of the past few years.\nIt really doesn't matter if you the viewer agree with Moore; his aim is to make you feel something, whether it's disgust toward the administration or disdain toward the film and its creator. If you're a staunch Republican who supports the president no matter what, you almost certainly won't be swayed by this movie; you're far more likely to view it as leftist propaganda. If you're an opponent of the president and his policies, this movie will only reinforce your viewpoint. So, in that sense, it is definitely propaganda - clearly so.\nMoore's MO is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. And boy, are there plenty of both in this movie. He interviews soldiers in Iraq; some are elated to be there and treat gunning down Iraqis like a video game, and others are openly dissatisfied for not being allowed to return stateside, even though their tours of duty have expired. Moore interviews the mother of a soldier stationed in Iraq; in the beginning of the movie, she's gung-ho for the war, proud that her children are overseas (she even says she thinks she's the proudest around, as if it were a contest). By the end of the movie, she's a grieving mother of a soldier killed in battle. Her scenes are searing in their emotion. She reads a letter from him, the last one he wrote; she'd received it a week or so before he died. \nAmong Moore's other tactics is badgering various members of Congress, asking them if they would mind enlisting their children. (Turns out only one member of Congress has a child serving in Iraq.) None will do so, which isn't surprising. Moore also examines the connection between the Bush family and the bin Laden family, especially pre-9/11, the strength of the relationship between the Saudi Arabian government (well, ruling family) and the Bush family, and the relationship between the Saudis and the United States economy.\nIt's important to recognize this movie for what it is; it's dangerous to assume that it's a straightforward documentary. It's an unabashed look at what historians may someday call one of the worst presidencies in American history. For now, though, it's just the first half."}

Or are they supposed to be funny? After watching this remake of George A. Romero's 1978 thriller (itself a sequel to 1968's Night of the Living Dead), I'm all confused. \nTo sum up, some kinda plague thingy breaks out, turning nearly everyone into jibbering idiots. After a while, it's hard to tell which ones are zombies and which ones have simply been watching too much election coverage. All heck breaks loose. Loved ones are killing each other. Little kids, too. Everyone's gone all higgledy-piggledy.\nA hardy bunch of survivors makes its way to the most American of inventions, the shopping mall. They have all they need - food, shelter, TVs, XBoxes, and a zillion zombies patrolling outside the mall, desperate to get in and feast on the nice, fresh meat.\nLemme stop for a minute here and wonder out loud. (Note: This is a rhetorical question.) Why do zombies need fresh meat? Why can't they just feast on each other, or even themselves? Would they even notice if they bit their own hand off, for example? (Okay, that was three rhetoricals.)\nSo our intrepid gang barricades itself inside the mall. But they soon want to get out. They're holding out hope that somewhere out there, there's someone who's not quite dead yet. You know, somewhere where the zombies haven't quite taken over. Like Canada, or something. But we the viewers know better, don't we? This is as good as it gets, staying in a mall all the time. If it were me, I don't know if I'd ever leave. \nBut oh, those nutty survivors. They're communicating with the crazy cat a building or so over via sandwich board, playing chess long distance and the like. We see all kinds of fun and exciting activities, all set to a peppy song, whose name and beat I have conveniently forgotten for all eternity.\nSo they want to get out. Their plan is to commandeer two of the mall's shuttle buses, fortify the crap out of them, and off they go. Well, bad things happen. The end.\nThis movie failed for me because at no point was I scared. I didn't jump out of my seat, or even shudder. Sure, there's gore, but it's pretty mundane. If you've seen one head explode, you've seen 'em all. (Oddly enough, when someone shoots a zombie in the head late in the movie, Ving Rhames is inexplicably impressed.) Movies like this need to have a strong sense of reality; the viewer must be able to imagine that this is happening Right Now, outside his or her own door. And this movie utterly failed to do so for me, which made it take on a surreal and ultimately comic sheen.\nThe acting's no prize, either. I know these guys had little interesting or unique to say, but I felt little sympathy for them regardless - and that's the actor's job. Convey to me how awful your situation is. I wasn't openly rooting for the zombies, but sometimes I felt like it.\nOne final nitpick - the ending credits sequence contains footage of What Happens Next. It's very, very jarring; credits are shown on a red background, then there's a quick cut to video, then back to the credits, on and on and on. Distracting and pointless."}

Oh, it <i>thinks</i> it's clever, but it outsmarts itself, dissolving instead into a puddle of drivel.\nBasic story is that Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a high schooler with some awesomely awful visions; he keeps seeing an evil mutant bunny rabbit who tells him to commit acts of violence and that the world's ending in 28 days. You know, your garden variety doom-and-gloom stuff. Donnie doesn't know how to deal with these horrendous visions, so his family sends him to a psychiatrist.\nin a very early scene, one of Donnie's acting-out episodes (or is it sleepwalking) finds him outside the house in the middle of the night. Suddenly, a plane engine crashes into his house, landing in his bedroom. No one's hurt, but it's the first of several weird tragedies to befall him and his family. Donnie thinks it's a sign.\nMaggie Gyllenhaal (who, as you might surmise from her name, is Jake's sister in real life) plays his older sister here, and she's fantastic in the few scenes she's in. Mary McDonnell plays their mom. Some guy and some girl play the father and the younger sister, respectively; neither made an impression on me. Jena Malone plays Donnie's new girlfriend. Drew Barrymore has a thankfully small role as a teacher. Even Patrick Swayze shows up.\nTime travel, philosophy, nihilism, evil clowns, evil bunny rabbits, and funky coincidences all play roles. Absurdity upon absurdity is heaped onto the steaming pile of plot with the apparent intent to confuse and obfuscate. Weirdness does not cleverness equal, sadly. J. Gyllenhaal is miscast; he looks too pure and innocent."}

But since the Civil War is underway, there aren't any handymen to be found who could help her with the day-to-day operations, so Ruby Thewes (Rene Zellweger), a rough-and-tumble tomboy who happens to have long, flowing blonde hair and wear a copious amount of lipstick, shows up to lend a hand and a barbed tongue.\nThere are two story strands: Inman's travails as he desperately tries to get home (and labeled a deserter, at that) and Ada's difficulties as she alternately clears fields and pines for Inman. And pine she does! She can't live without him, it seems, and yet.. and yet somehow, she does. She puts off advances from other, opportunistic menfolk who are a-dyin' to get in her britches, all the while learning all kinds of Man Stuff, like firing a gun. O, will she survive? Will Inman make it home before his not-a-wife gives up and marries the cad from down the lane? I'm all a-twitter with my ruminations. \nKidman and Law are well cast and do have some chemistry together (and Kidman's appropriately pale in complexion, since she's playing someone who's been sheltered most of her life, at least figuratively speaking). Zellweger, however, seems hilariously miscast. I know part of it is because her character's so broadly written, but her performance alternately made me chuckle and cringe, chuckle and cringe.\nIt doesn't help that the movie's slowly paced and has at least two too many endings. Anthony Minghella directed, though, so that was to be expected."}

They're stranded in open ocean water.\nThat's certainly a terrifying scenario (and based on a true incident), but the movie isn't entirely satisfying. Even at its short running time of 79 minutes, Open Water is dreadfully dull at times.\nThe first 15 minutes or so covers background, as Daniel and Susan get ready for what's apparently a much-needed vacation. Susan is shown talking on her cell phone a few times, establishing that she leads a Hectic Life that serves as the impetus for the downtime. Then we see them board the boat with 18 other divers, travel to the dive location, and plunge into the water. The guides count how many divers have returned, but they miscount (one guy, after returning, goes back in with another guy who'd forgotten his mask and is borrowing one); therefore when 20 divers are tallied as having returned, the boat departs.\nDaniel and Susan rise to the surface, and at first they can't believe the boat has left, thinking maybe they've drifted. But as the hours and hours pass with no boat, tension mounts considerably. Even though they can sometimes see other boats, the distance is too great to swim - and their cries are unheard.\nI waited and waited for the main focus of the film (that is, the moment when they realize they're stranded), but by then I wasn't as interested in the main characters. They seemed like appealing people, but I could never get it out of my mind that they were actors. And that's the problem - movies like this need to be ultrarealistic to draw the audience in. Because everything was so drawn out, it was almost as if we the audience were being manipulated: Something's going to happen, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, ad infinitum.\nOur heroes face exhaustion, hunger, cold, and illness; there are appearances by sharks, sharks, sharks, and some other fish you won't care much about. There's bickering and whininess and insane rantings. These are all plausible elements, of course, but I still wasn't drawn into the plot.\nThe movie was made for a pittance, and it shows; director Chris Kentis also wrote, edited and co-filmed. By consolidating the duties, though, Kentis gave us four subpar work performances. The movie seemed paced too slowly, which allowed suspense to peter out, rather than build up; the shots weren't particularly creative, even given the limited setting. Even worse, though, was the soundtrack, which was intermittently pointless and intrusive. There were times when I'd hear some reggae or calypso music and think it was coming from an approaching boat, while the camera lingered on Daniel's and Susan's faces for a few minutes. It as only after a little while that I realized it was simply part of the soundtrack.\nOpen Water is real thumb-twaddler of a movie. Despite its promotion as a scary, suspenseful movie, only the ending itself is suspenseful; the rest is pretty predictable, telegraphed well in advance by an inexperienced filmmaker."}

Whodunit?\nThe movie begins creepily enough, with some requisite background on Miranda (Berry) on how she interacts with her husband/boss (Charles S. Dutton) of the institute, her coworker Pete (Robert Downey, Jr.), and her prize patient Chloe (Penelope Cruz, gettin' all ugly and stuff), followed by her waking up in the aforementioned glass you-will-not-escape cell.\nWhy is she there? Why does she have no memory of getting there? Why is Pete so irritated with her? You'll care about these questions, too, but rest easy: Your caring will soon dissipate.\nChilling stories, especially ghost stories, are best told with no small amount of subtlety. Hit the audience over the head with effects, and you might as well be showing them a slasher film. And that's what this one is, at times, replete with blood and guts and action, action, action. If you stop to think about what Miranda's doing, you'll realize how little of it makes any real sense.\nGothika is overwrought; its twists are broadcast so blatantly that you'll feel like the electroshock therapy some of the patients at the institute receive. Bad guys? We got bad guys. You can usually scope out the bad guy at the beginning of a cheesy movie, because he's the one who looks perfectly ok. Even if you don't guess the bad guy's identity early on, I'm betting you won't be terribly surprised when you do find out who it is.\nOn paper, this must have seemed like a great career choice for Berry, but like Catwoman, this is not a shining moment for her. And don't fool yourself - this is a Halle Berry event all the way. Those other guys in the movie? Interchangeable. I'll admit that Downey, Jr. turns in a - shall we say - more mature performance than he did during his heyday, but perhaps that's a result of all those drugs and drying-out periods. \nGothika's poorly written but competently acted and directed - considering the script.

Nope, that's it, I'm through giving him the benefit of the doubt. See, I really loved The Sixth Sense. Thought it was fantastic. Creepy, too. I liked Unbreakable, too. Sure, it was flawed, and I could see how some people might not like it, but I appreciated with Shyamalan was doing, and I liked the two lead performances. But then Signs came. And I thought Signs was hideously dreadful, lacking a sense of humor when it was needed and being way too flippant when the situation called for levity. I felt Signs was merely a product of an overactive ego and an inactive imagination. But I figured that since even the best filmmakers have their vanity movies, I'd forgive Shyamalan his Signs and looked forward to his next movie. Well, The Village isn't much better than Signs, and that's a real shame.\nThe setting is 1897 in a remote village in the Pennsylvania woods. It's a very quiet, unpreposessing village, complete with village elders, politeness among folk, and a one-room school house. (These folks look and act Amish, although that's not specified.)\nBut this idyllic, placid hamlet has a secret. See, it's bordered on all sides by the forest, and within the forest are these unspeakable creatures, Those Who Shall Not Be Named. Oddly enough, you would think such an appellation would prevent people from openly discussing said creatures, but I lost count how many times they were mentioned. Anyway, the creatures, we're told, have a deal with the villagers - no villager will cross the perimeter into the forest, and no creature will enter the village. The villagers have yellow flags around their perimeter and a giant tower with a bell at the top, so if and when a creature comes a-calling, the bell can be rung and people can get to safety. The village elders, led by Edward Walker (William Hurt, sincere as always), forbid anyone from crossing the perimeter; the villagers are also informed that the creatures hate the color red (\"the bad color,\" as it's called in hushed whispers!).\nWeird things have been afoot, though. Small animals have been killed in the village, skinned and left to be discovered by open-mouthed villagers. And when a creature is indeed spotted entering the perimeter, the next morning there are slashes of red paint on the doors of people's homes. What could this mean? Who hath breached the perimeter?\nOne man, Lucius Hunt (played with open-mouth ennui by Joaquin Phoenix), asks the elders for permission to go to a neighboring village to get medicine. You see, the village is hampered by a distinct lack of medical supplies, and when its citizens are quite ill, they have no choice but to watch them die. They'd prefer this, apparently, to getting medical supplies.\nNow, any time the phrase \"only one man\" pops up in a synopsis of a movie, you know you need to relax your curiosity and just let things happen. \"Oh, here we go,\" you think. \"Good IL' Commodus is going to be the One Man who can save the villagers from the creatures - and themselves!\"\nThere are a few twists to the movie, so I'll halt the synopsis here. The trouble is the twists are likely to affect you in one of two ways: Either you'll say, \"I saw THAT coming,\" or you'll merely shrug your shoulders and wonder if the exit door to the theater will open to a part of the parking lot that's a real hike to your car. Personally, I was affected in both ways.\nThe movie's simply not well written. There's suspense, but often it's clouded by contrivances in the plot. Shyamalan wants us to fear the creatures as much as the villagers do, but he doesn't succeed. We're supposed to feel empathy for the villagers, but all I could feel was pity and scorn.\nThe pacing is pretty tight, which is nice, since it's essential that a suspense movie be well paced. But the camera angles often looked amateurish and/or auteurish; either Shyamalan didn't know how to shoot a particular scene or he decided to be cute and make it seem as if the scene had some sort of Deep Meaning. Now, it's true there's a moral to the story here (something about You Stay on Your Side, I'll Stay on Mine), but the tone achieved by the direction didn't really convey that. A huge debit, too, is the soundtrack - does Shyamalan not know how to use one effectively? In most scenes, the soundtrack was blaring at such a high volume that the actors could barely be heard. What's the point of that, exactly?\nFinally, the acting. No one is spectacularly miscast (although I wonder if Adrien Brody, who won an Oscar for goodness sake, is kicking himself for agreeing to play the village idiot), but no one really shines, either. How could they, with a plot so thin you could read fine print through it? Most of the actors are... well, useless. They don't do much with what little they have to work with and are essentially wasted, especially Sigourney Weaver. Hurt is quietly effective, but it's a role he can play in his sleep by this point. Newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard is moderately annoying, which ain't good when you have a very prominent role.\nThe Village is trite and cloying, a mishmash of \"twists\" that alternately make no sense and make too much sense and can be foretold well in advance. M. Night Shyamalan has taken a pretty solid, intriguing premise and riddled it with illogic and disdain."}

That is, until one of the little kids in line to see Santa (known only as Kid) strikes some kind of chord with Willie, as little kids in movies are wont to do. \nThe good news is that it does take a while for the kid to win over Willie. The bad news is that it happens at all - or, at least, that it's handled rather clumsily. Sure, it's a comedy, but the Coen brothers were the executive producers. As with Intolerable Cruelty, the brothers simply didn't know what to do with this film; was it a laugh-out-loud comedy? A feel-good picture? A dark comedy? It could have wound up being any of those, but instead it was all three at different points in the film.\nNone of the characters was particularly well drawn, but since the focus was on Willie, this isn't a huge debit. Thornton's not bad, but Cox easily steals the show from him as his blue-talking partner.

While Amy has the couple's main house, Mort's in their cabin in the woods, working on his next novel.

Mort insists to Shooter that his story is older and that he can prove it - he just needs to find the issue of Ellery Queen magazine. Shooter agrees to give him some time, but we know better. We know Shooter's not going to just roll over if he ever sees the magazine. \nAdded to the chaos in Mort's life is his pending divorce from Amy. The ten-year marriage finally ended when Mort discovered Amy and her new beau Ted (Timothy Hutton) in bed at a cheap motel, an incident that's played back for us a few times. \nTo say any more might be giving away too much, but this is certainly not a run-of-the-mill thriller. If you still need a reason to believe that Johnny Depp can really act, please watch this movie and be forever charmed. Depp is magnificent, and it's easy to see that a lesser actor would have floundered in the role. The rest of the cast is basically background noise, but Bello in particular turned in a magnificent performance. But it's all about Mort, how he perceives things, how he reacts to things."}

With a new director on board (Alfonso Cuaron), the tone of the series has shifted somewhat, to a darker, more serious Harry Potter universe.\nIf you've read the books, you should also be warned: There's a lot of stuff in the third book that doesn't appear in the third movie. Part of this is out of necessity, as this film is a bit shorter than the first two (while the book is longer), but even so there are characters from the book who don't appear in the movie and story threads that aren't satisfactorily resolved.\nThe crux of the story is that the man who led Lord Voldemort to Harry's parents, Sirius Black, has escaped from Azkaban Prison, presumably to hunt down the offspring of his onetime close friends - and kill him! The guards at Azkaban, the Dementors, are out in full force to track down Black and return him to prison. Ah, but these are no ordinary guards; the Dementors - dark, faceless beings in black cloaks - feed off a person's emotions, eventually sucking their soul out, rending them helpless. The Dementors personify depression in the extreme, you see.\nHarry first encounters the Dementors on the way to school aboard the Hogwarts Express as they search the train for Black. It's not an enjoyable encounter for the boy wizard, who faints dead away.\nLater, at the school, it's learned that Black is getting closer and closer. Will he find Harry?\nNew to the faculty at Hogwarts are Remus Lupin as the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor (a position that is empty at the end of each book) and Sybil Trelawney as the Divination professor. Both figured into the plot of the book, but only Lupin gets any real screen time in the movie. Lupin, played with effortless panache by David Thewlis, winds up being a confidante of Harry, and he has more than a few secrets in his closet as well. Also, taking the place of the late Richard Harris as Headmaster Dumbledore is Michael Gambon, while Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) is promoted to the position of professor.\nThere are two main plotlines at work here: the anticipation of the arrival of Black and the revelations of the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Harry's parents. We learned a bit at the end of each of the first two HP films, and this one too takes its sweet time in clueing us all in.\nA new director and tone can lead to some dangerous uncharted waters, and expectations must be tempered somewhat. Please do go to this movie expecting the charm of the first two; this is not your older brother's HP. As Harry himself matures, so must his movies, and this one is more cynical and downbeat at times than either of the first two in the series. This matches, at least somewhat, the tenor of the third book itself.\nCuaron's direction is excellent, and his little touches are abundant (such as the rearranging of the Hogwarts grounds, the use of the Whomping Willow as a device to show time, and endless presence of a giant outdoors clock). The movie doesn't lag too much, although it's possible that a newcomer to the HP oeuvre might not pick up all of the plot threds.\nThe cast does a good job, I think, in maintaining the spirit of the previous movies and books. The young lead trio (Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson) are aging quite well; in fact, I think Watson is becoming quite a wonderful young actress. (Grint, by the way, holds his hamminess down to a dull roar.)\nThey're well supported, of course, by a who's who of master British thespians, from Thompson to Thewlis to Alan Rickman (still delightfully creepy as Snape) to Gambon to Maggie Smith to Coltrane. Any British actor who's anyone wants to be in these movies, and that's high praise indeed.\nThe special effects, too, aren't second rate.

But beware, there are some scenes that the younguns may find a bit more unsettling than either of the first two movies.\nMy score: ***1/2"}

It's the kind of movie you always want to watch the day after tomorrow, no matter what the day is.\nOkay, cheap joke. Always a good way to start a review, even if it's a joke that'll show up in most lukewarm reviews. \nTornados in Los Angeles! A tidal wave in New York! Superduperquick frost!! Run! Get the kids, go to the basement! No, wait, it'll flood there. Go to the top floor! No, wait, the tornado will get you. Ahhh! Die!\nSeems that when Hollywood wants you to get killed, well then by gum you get killed, logic be damned. See, the polar ice caps are melting (perhaps you've read about this somewhere). According to paleoclimatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), the fresh water from the melted caps was interfering with the salt water of the oceans (who knew?), causing desalinization, which in turn apparently causes every natural disaster known the man, even hurricanes that appear over land (hint: they usually appear over water).\nHall's model claims this'll all happen over the next 100, 1000 years (he's not sure, of course), but during a conference in New Delhi the vice president of the United States heckles him from the audience. As in most disaster movies, this is foreshadowing; as soon as the mess happens (first in L.A., for a change), Jack tries to warn the veep about What Might Happen, and he's ignored. (\"He tried to tell them... but they wouldn't listen!\") It's up to Jack to save the day!\nAt the same time, Jack's son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is attending some kind of smart-kid trivia contest in New York. When the tidal wave hits the city, Sam and his gang (including the One Nerd in his group, the Girl of Sam's Dreams; and the Cad Who Might Steal Her Away from Sam) are pretty much stranded. At first, they attempt to get back to home to Washington, but a last-second phone call to Jack convinces Sam to stick it out in the New York Public Library.\nThe dichotomy between father and son isn't subtle. Sam's a bit of a rebel, having received a failing grade in a class for not showing his work, and Jack's always rebelling against his bosses at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. At the library, Sam decides to walk across the giant ice floe that's developed in Manhattan to a Russian tanker that's somehow made its way into town. (Don't ask.) Back in D.C., Jack decides to fulfill a promise he'd made to his son (look! More foreshadowing!) and trek to New York to get his son. There are two instances of \"No! I can't let you go alone!\" as Jack's comrades in science and Sam's friends help out.\nAt any rate, Jack's eventually called in to brief the president and the Joint Chiefs. Of course, why wouldn't he be? He's obviously the only scientist in the world who said global warming would be the end of us all. During the briefing, he outlines the bad news, that in about 7-10 days the face of the globe would be changed forever. Jack's a real downer, isn't he? Someone in the room asks him what his plan is, which is funny - I thought that was THEIR job. But that's what they do in these disaster movies; they ask the scientist what he thinks should be done, and then they ignore him. But this time, they don't. Probably because by that time New York was 100 feet under water and snow, and Los Angeles was demolished by three twisters. So what's Jack's plan? Evacuation. Get this - he draws a line on a map, cutting the United States in half widthwise. All of the states below the line should be evacuated; those above it, Jack says, are already lost. It's too late to save him, he claims. The southern states should go to Mexico.\nBearing in mind that the science in this movie is already highly suspect, one must also realize that emigrating to Mexico is a pretty dumb idea. Why there? If the frosty badness is going to hit, say, Texas, why would it stop at the Rio Grande? The entire southwest U.S. seemed to be as safe as Mexico, and yet the president orders everyone to go there (which led to some laughter in the audience - U.S. citizens charging en masse across to border TO Mexico?). Only after the U.S. forgives a ton of third-world debt are we allowed to overrun Mexico. Which only seems fair. (Note to third-world countries! Hope for a massive disaster to befall us so your debt will be forgiven!)\n(As an aside, here's a drinking game for you to try when this comes out on video. Every time someone says, \"My God!\" or some variant, chug some vodka.)\nThe special effects weren't bad, but they weren't nearly as convincing as they should have been, given that there was no real character development, a simple plot, and an atmosphere that failed to get me to care about any of the participants (although it did try). The tornados looked real, and so did the tidal wave (to an extent), but the timberwolves that fortuitously show up about halfway through didn't look at all real - perhaps because they weren't. They were computer generated.\nThe entire tone of the movie was off a little, too. Imagine this in real life. Tens of millions of people are going to die. Sure, you'd be concerned about your own skin, but you wouldn't likely forget that this was going to affect so many people. This movie, however, makes the imminent deaths of all of the offscreen people nothing more than background noise. There's obvious mass bloodshed here, but no one seems to bat an eye.\nThere are also superfluous characters and story threads, which is fine if you're in the middle of a four-night blockbuster miniseries. It's not fine when you have to cram everything into two hours or so. Shedding some characters would have helped immensely. \nThrough it all, Dennis Quaid as Jack is very strong, perhaps the best work he's done in years. He didn't have much to work with, but I think he did a great, soulful performance. (I say \"soulful\" because I don't think the director has one, and the performances of most of the cast leads me to doubt theirs as well.) Gyllenhaal is his equal as Sam, perhaps making up for his awful performance in October Sky. But most of the cast is just there, taking up space. One other notable mention, though; Ian Holm as Dr. Rapson, the scientist in Scotland who alerts Jack to the impending doom is outstanding, leagues better than the material.\nOne of the aspects of a disaster film that make it satisfying to moviegoers is that it has a palatable ending. Your ship sank? Well, at least some people survived and can simply pick up the pieces of their broken life, or at least hum the melody to a sad country song. But not the ostensible survivors of this movie, no. See, these natural disasters are supposedly the harbingers of another ice age. Yeah, you got it. They have to deal with this crap for 10,000 years.\nThe Day after Tomorrow is mediocre, with poor plotting, vacant characterizations, and mostly crummy special effects. It has some unintentionally hilarious moments, but overall it's a waste of time. Still, if you must see it, please see it on the big screen."}

A hapless, hopeless sad sack. Bernie's job at the Shangri-La casino is to impart bad luck on gamblers who are enjoying good luck. It seems pretty easy, doesn't it? Guy gets on a run at the craps table. Bernie stands next to him, maybe plays once, and suddenly the guy craps out. Saves the casino a lot of money, making a happy camper out of Shelly Kaplow (Alec Baldwin).\nBut Bernie's had enough of the casino life, and he's leaving in a week. But do you seriously think Shelly's going to let him walk out? Bernie's the best \"cooler\" the casino has, maybe the best ever. Shelly needs Bernie to help keep down the amount paid out to customers. So Shelly asks barmaid Natalie (Maria Bello) to look after Bernie, to make him feel good, to pick up his spirits so he doesn't leave the Shangri-La.\nIt's the best-laid plan of a rat, in this case. Predictably, Natalie falls for Bernie. Oh, hell hath no fury like a corrupt casino owner scorned, and Shelly plots his revenge in order to protect his investment. Oh, and while fending off the \"new age\" ideas of Larry Sokolov (Ron Livingston of Office Space), who's brought in by Shelly financial backers to bring the casino into the modern era. \nWhenever I see William H. Macy in a movie, I know for absolute certain that he's going to turn in a perfect, nuanced performance. Even in bad movies, he stands out as a true professional. But his is not the only strong portrayal here. Baldwin, who received an Oscar nomination, is aces as the vicious, conflicted, but never out-of-control Shelly. Even when the situation looks like Shelly has no idea what to do, Shelly himself looks like he has all of the answers. Almost as good as Baldwin is Bello, a Tea Leoni lookalike, but with talent. Hers is a fantastic performance; she really held her own against Macy and Baldwin.\nThe movie is fairly well paced, without much lag, and the storyline moves along amiably; there are no extraneous story lines (save, perhaps, for a bit with Paul Sorvino as an aging lounge singer). The tone is dark and moody, although it's splattered with flecks of hope throughout. Hope, you see, is the underlying theme: hope that Bernie can escape Shelly, hope that Bernie can be with Natalie."}

No, not Democrats versus Republicans, or politicians versus the truth. It's vampires versus werewolves (or Lycans, if you prefer), Evil versus evil. Or good evil versus bad evil.\nSelene (Kate Beckinsale) is a beautiful vampire warrior who comes across a human named Michael (Scott Speedman), who's been marked by the werewolves. Why Michael? Are the Lycans planning to use him in their endless battle with the vampires? Will Michael fall for the lovely, the talented Selene? Will Selene get to kick some werewolf butt? Yes, like sand through the hourglass of time in a bottle, these are the burning questions that are thankfully answered within the first twenty minutes or so.\nThe film is very similar to The Crow in style (and in a nod to the earlier film, Speedman's character is named Michael Corvin; the lead character in The Crow: City of Angels was named Ashe Corven); it's dark, noirish dark, foreboding dark, bad-guy dark, you name it. See, there's dark, and then there's dark dark. This is the latter. Now, the original Crow movie was wildly stylish, and Underworld carries that torch a little bit further. Not only does style triumph over substance, it body slams it to death and then dances on its grave. In other words, don't look too closely at the plot, which doesn't always hold up to close scrutiny. But that's not likely, since the film's so dark (did I mention that).\nAs with most comic-book-atmosphere tales, this one is full of Pretty People. Even vampires and werewolves gotta look good, you know, what with the extra grooming and tooth filing and all. At any rate, there's nary an Ugly Person in sight. Even the despicable ones are Pretty People.\nAs Selene, Kate Beckinsale is very good, appropriately slinky and pliant. Beckinsale's not known for taking on tough roles such as this - you usually see her in upper-crust films such as Emma and Cold Comfort Farm. But she acquits herself very well, so much so that there's a sequel planned for 2005.\nHer primary foil is Shane Brolly as Kraven, the leader of the vampires. Brolly snarls a lot, showing off what have to be more than the usual 32 teeth in the process. Brolly didn't have much in the way of facial expressions here, just you're basic \"I'm mad!\" and \"I'm madder!\" looks.\nUnderworld is agreeably well done, with a believable romance between Speedman and Beckinsale shunted to the background. This is about werewolves versus vampires, with men in the background, clueless as always, so the romance played out well on a subtle level."}

Okay, that's usually a blessing; I believe people are more likely to go to a movie if Crichton's name is attached to it. Think Jurassic Park, Disclosure, Coma, and so on.\nThen consider that the director is the skilled Richard Donner, the auteur who brought us the Lethal Weapon movies. Since Timeline is supposed to be a sci-fi/action/thriller, he seems like a good choice, right?\nBut oh, the troubles! How can I count them all in a compact way that won't bore you? It won't be easy, but trust me on this: It'll be easier than your sitting through Timeline.\nIf you're expecting this movie to be an adaptation of the novel, you'll be disappointed. The most basic outline of the plot remains (young excavators travel to 14th century to rescue professor), but so much has been changed. Now, it's not uncommon for a screenwriter to make changes that he or she feels will make the story more cinematic, and sometimes these changes even make sense within the book's storyline. Here, for some reason, one of the youngsters attempting to rescue Professor Johnston (Billy Connolly) is his son Chris (Paul Walker). In the book, Chris was an archaeologist who was forever pining after one of the rich local French ladies. Did the screenwriter feel a stronger bond between Chris and the professor was necessary? Weird. \nBut leaving the plot changes aside, the performances were wildly awful, almost universally. Walker, who's been decent in such movies as Varsity Blues and The Fast and the Furious, comes off as completely clueless here as Chris, even though the character was pretty bright in the book. Walker delivers each line in a weird, nonchalant surfer drawl, leaving me to finish each of his lines with a \"dude.\" \"Okay, I like, don't know where we are, but I think we're like, lost. Dude.\" You see what I mean? What was he even doing in this movie? Chris is supposedly Johnston's son, but his is a distinctly American accent (Connolly, of course, has a very thick Scottish brogue). This may have been explained in an early scene, but I had already settled into full mocking mode by then.\nThe others are no better. Frances O'Connor plays Kate, a skilled climber. We know she's a skilled climber because she reminds us in practically every scene she's in! \"Someone has to climb on this roof and drop down to the other side!\" \"I'll do it! I am the best climber here!\" Yes, you go. Go, Kate, go. She was so busy proving how wonderful she was that she forgot to turn in a nuanced performance. But that's okay, because her character was as well developed as a Polaroid print two seconds after it's been taken.\nTo be fair, nearly every character is nothing more than a cardboard cutout, a caricature of Good or Bad, Strong or Weak. It's like the screenwriter had just taken his first creative writing class and hadn't gotten around to learning how to flesh out his characters. But Connolly as the professor? Why? Because he's Scottish, of course. A Scotsman digging in France with Americans and Englishmen. Maybe the filmmakers felt Connolly was able to evoke a sense of authority; if so, they miscalculated miserably. Connolly was as strong as a wet kite in a ferocious wind. \nSo, to recap, the writing was awful, the acting was pathetic, and the direction was suspect. Oh, and the casting was subpar.\n\nAs I mentioned, I mocked this movie freely. Luckily enough, I was watching it at home, where the only other living creature save the roaches was the dog, and he was mocking right along with me. I was quite happy that I hadn't spent the money to see this in the theater and was therefore able to make fun of the movie in the comfort of my own home. The screenwriter should be ashamed to have changed so many details from the book, because the changes didn't help things (and often confused the plot further for those who had read the book) and were wholly unnecessary, to boot. But don't worry, Michael Crichton fans! The failure of this movie won't prevent the adaptation of further Crichton books; there's a Jurassic Park IV on the horizon."}

True epic movies, you see, have not only bombast and pomp but also portend Great Importance. An epic movie is one that establishes a tone of deep meaning, not harmless fluff.\nAnd so it is with all three of the Lord of the Rings movies. In The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), we learn of a bad of nine travelers with the task of returning the One Ring to the fires of Mount Doom, from which the adornment was made. In The Two Towers (2002), we follow their travails as some of the members split up, with returning the ring still the ultimate goal. Now, with The Return of the King, we see their tales told in full. Will Frodo and Sam make it to Mount Doom, past the gigantic army of orcs, without the Lidless Eye spotting them? Will Aragorn (the King of the title) be able to rally enough troops to forestall the orc attacks? Will any of the original Fellowship fall along the way, to be forgotten except in hobbit songs evermore?\nThe story thread picks up right where The Two Towers left off. Frodo (bearing the ring) and Sam are now separated from the rest of their crew and are on a singular mission to return the ring to its foundry. With them is Gollum, a former hobbit whose long possession of the One Ring has driven him completely mad and has transformed his appearance into that of some underground netherworld creature, rather than a jolly hobbit.\nMeanwhile, Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli, and Leglolas arrive at Orthanc, the tower formerly held by Saruman (the evil wizard). Saruman's been deposed by the Ents, a race of sentient trees headed by Treebeard. With Treebeard are two more of the original Fellowship: the hobbits Merry and Pippin.\nDoom is approaching. Sauron's minions are assembling massive orc armies to overrun the entire area, hoping to bring about the end of the Age of Man. It's up to Aragorn and the gang to save the day.\nEach of the three movies has been an absolute joy to watch. Even if one has never read one word of J.R.R. Tolkien, one is very quickly drawn into the story, into the world of Middle-Earth. Even if one cannot tell an orc from a Balrog, one can follow the sometimes complicated storylines. This is because director Peter Jackson does an incredible job of explaining things without getting bogged down in the myriad details that Tolkien's epic book (or books) provided.\nAs with most epic movies, this one grabs you in two distinct places: the heart and the mind. The audience is properly mesmerized as the soldiers of Gondar race to the aid of those of Rohan, as the orc legions attack the castle at Minas Trith. All of the scenes, from the quiet, underplayed exchanges between Sam and Frodo to the wild, chaotic war, were suitably jam-packed with emotion. You'd have to be quite the zombie not to fall completely under the spell of these movies, especially these characters.\nWhile Jackson took a few liberties with the plot (as he did in The Two Towers), none of the changes detracted from the movie itself. Because Tolkien's fantasy epic was so chock full of nuance, it was inherently necessary to chop some of them from the movie. Film as a medium is more conducive to images than to facts and other details.\nThis was not a movie that one could simply watch and cheer the good guys on lustily. This movie drew one in so deeply that you lived and breathed as the characters lived and breathed. When Frodo is attacked by the spider Shelob, you jump with him. You feel it when he's injected with her poison. When the orcs are attacking the castle with their war machines and their oliphaunts (think mastadons), you cringe with the denizens of the city of kings. As an audience, you never feel detached from the action.\nBut in addition to all the mesmerizing, eye-popping action, there were a great many tearful scenes. I mean scenes so powerful that only the most robotic among us could look away without shedding a tear. There were plenty of sniffles and tears in our theater the other day. Fantastic evocative performances by everyone in the cast, especially Sean Astin as Sam, Billy Boyd as Pippin, David Wenham as Faramir, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, and Miranda Otto as Eowyn. Oh, and definitely the great Ian McKellen as Gandalf.\nNot a dry eye in the place. The sweet, gentle ending was as poignant an ending as I've ever seen in a movie. The ending, by the way, ties everything up nicely - but not too nicely. And, it's important to note, it ends just as the book does.\nThe movie is as close to perfection as possible, with the two tales of Frodo and Sam and the orc attacks neatly dovetailing, then culminating at the same time. And the editing is never jarring, even though quite a bit had to be cut in order for the film to be released - and it's still nearly 3.5 hours long!\nThe Return of the King is a beautiful masterpiece, a pinnacle of moviemaking. It will certainly be up for a few Oscars come March, and I wouldn't be surprised if it were listed in the National Film Registry some year as one of the greatest American films of all time."}

Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a has-been actor who's relegated to pitching alcohol in a TV ad; Charlotte (Scarlett Johanson) is the somewhat-neglected wife of a photographer (Giovanni Ribisi) who's in town to do a shoot.\nCharlotte and Bob are staying at the same hotel, and both are living through the same experience of getting through the day as fish out of water. Living the life of a tourist-American isn't always fun and games, you know. Bob just wants to finish his commercial shoot and then get home, even though the marriage with his stateside wife is devoid of passion, and Scarlett isn't quite sure what she wants. \nIt's not improbable that these two should wind up spending some time together, especially since in Tokyo they stick out like the cliched sore thumbs (especially Murray, who's much taller than any of the Japanese around him at all times). They decide to hang out together, to make the most of the time they have to spend in a foreign land.\nOne of the biggest complaints I've heard about this movie is that it's too slow, but I consider that to be its most engaging characteristic. This is not an action movie. This isn't a smart-alecky comedy with rapid-fire hilarity. In essence, it's a two-character study.\nA good film for comparison is Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise (1995). In that movie, Jesse (an American) and Celine (a Frenchwoman) meet on a train traveling from Budapest to Vienna, and we witness their relationship gradually ascend from that of slight acquaintances to full-blown amour. Bob and Charlotte's relationship progresses much the same way, but it's even more subtle (believe it or not). Charlotte, the lonely photographer's wife, and Bob, the unwilling participant in a disaffected marriage, find in each other a true kindred spirit.\nThis isn't something easily expressed on screen, and even on the printed page it's difficult to pull off. But the masterful Oscar-winning script by Sofia Coppola (who also directed) is so superb in its attention to detail, along with the perfectly nuanced performances of Johansson and Murray (nominated for an Oscar) are the ideal combination. The audience is utterly convinced that these two characeters are meant for each other, at least on some level.\nNot one note of this movie rang falsely for me, but it is not for everyone. Don't let the multiple Oscar nominations sway you - if you do not like quiet, subtle movies, you probably won't like Lost in Translation. For the rest of you, it's a true gem."}

Our expectations are lowered at a rate proportional to the number of years since the first movie was produced. Using that logic, this remake of the 1974 ne plus ultra of low-budget gore from Tobe Hooper should be either an absolute laugh riot or a stunningly awful scare flick.\nBut this 2003 remake isn't either of those. I was fully prepared to laugh out loud at inappropriate times (it's okay, it was in the privacy of my own apartment) and basically point and giggle at the bad dialogue and inept acting. But I hardly got the opportunity. Oh, sure, like most horror films this did have the occasional \"what the heck are they doing?\" moments, the sporadic lapses in logic. But for the most part, this is a well-told story with just the right amount of special effects (including blood and guts, of course). It's not a movie that throws every effect it can think of, drowning the viewer in coagulation (like the remake of The Haunting, or Freddy versus Jason, or the most recent Halloween movies). This movie relied on two main things: The storyline and the performances of the lead performers. How unhorror-like!\nAt its heart, the story is pretty simple: A group of five kids, on the way to a Lynryd Skynyrd concert, stops to pick up a dazed young girl on the side of the road. She's not terribly coherent, and just a few minutes after they've resumed their journey she puts a gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger, producing a gaping hole in her head and in the rear window of the kids' van.\nSo many horror movies begin this way, don't they? Now the kids have a dead girl in their van, so they bring her to the nearest town. And that's where the fun begins.\nIt's been a long time since I saw the original TCM, but this movie seems to keep pretty close to the general storyline. Kids find creepy house, kids get slaughtered, one person survives... you know how it goes. The movie's presented as \"what really happened\" that fateful day in 1973, bookended by \"real\" film by police of the crime scene. Oh, and in a nifty touch, the narrator of the original has been brought back to narrate this one - the one and only John Larroquette, who was uncredited in the original.\nThis remake was surprisingly well done, with quick pacing (Michael Bay was one of the producers), excellent atmosphere, some genuine frights and chills, and competent work by a game cast of mostly unknowns (Jessica Biel of TV's 7th Heaven was the only person I recognized)."}

But that's a little unfair, since the first one was (for me) an amazing film.\nMaking a two-volume movie is a huge gamble. If the first one tanks, then no one's going to want to see the second one, which has likely already been filmed. If the first one is a rousing success, though, then it becomes the standard by which the second one is judged. For the filmmaker, this can be a losing proposition.\nThe movie follows the revenge game played by The Bride (Uma Thurman), on her quest to find the man who ordered her wedding party slaughtered. Oh, and the man whose baby she was carrying when he put a bullet in her brain. Only the bullet didn't kill The Bride - it merely put her in a long coma. And when she woke up - look out!\nIn the first film, The Bride tracked down two of her former compadres in killing as part of an elite hit squad. Now she has three names left on her list: Budd (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), and her ex-boss and ex-lover, Bill (David Carradine).\nQuentin Tarantino takes an approach similar to the one he used to such great success in Pulp Fiction and that he reused in the first Kill Bill movie - scenes (chapters, in this case) that are shown to the audience out of order. Luckily, the scenes aren't so jumbled that the audience can't follow what's going on. In fact, the order rearranging is fairly tame by Tarantino standards.\nTarantino does a great job in incorporating various movie genres into his film; it's part samurai thriller, part kung fu actioner, part cheesy, kitschy, zap-powie seventies schlock. He's always been proficient in this area; Pulp Fiction's characters at times seemed to be stuck in the seventies, but at the same time they didn't appear to be fish out of water. That's the genius of Tarantino.\nWhere this film diverges from the first, however, is in its pacing. Volume 1 was chock full of fast-paced action scenes - The Bride taking on the Crazy 88 springs to mind - but while there are a few interesting, riveting scenes in Vol. 2, there aren't nearly enough of them. And because there are insufficient action scenes, there are plenty of times when the movie seems to flag a little. A lull in a Tarantino movie can be richly cultivated (remember the \"awkward silences\" scene with Thurman and John Travolta in Pulp Fiction), but if there's nothing going on either above or below the surface, then the audience will get a little bored. Especially if they've been expecting wall-to-wall gore.\nThe performances are rather remarkable, however. Thurman continues to amaze as The Bride (a character she and Tarantino came up with together). Quick - how many action movies can you name that had a strong female lead? Ok, now how many of those were any good? Thurman would have to be incredible in order to carry this film, and she doesn't disappoint in the least. Whereas she was a pleasant surprise in Vol. 1, we now expect her to do the same in Vol. 2, and she's up to the task.\nEqually up to the task is 67-year-old David Carradine. Yep, 67. I didn't realize he was such an old goat! And one look at him... well, let's just say Mr. Carradine has lived a hard life. Leathery and craggy, he's a Mount Rushmore of actors - and I don't mean in terms of professional stature. Carradine's quickly approaching his dad's prolific career (John Carradine appeared in around 500 movies). But he's found the role of a lifetime as Bill, and he commands every scene he's in. That velvety-smooth, world-weary voice disguises a malevolent scheming that lets you know he will persevere in the end. But does he? Doesn't the title belie that answer?\nMichael Madsen is just okay in his role as Bill's brother Budd, but that's not an insult. He's just Michael Madsen, turning in a performance one expects from Michael Madsen (who could forget him as Mr. Blonde in Reservoir Dogs?).\nAnother of Tarantino's more admirable traits is that he's able to get compelling performances of a lifetime from his actors. Take Daryl Hannah. Could anyone really have predicted she would even be IN this movie? The mermaid from Splash? But as Elle Driver, Hannah's cold, sexy.... and blind in one eye. (How she lost that one eye is explained, rather vividly.)\nTarantino also loves to bring back moldy-oldie actors from Back in the Day, partly to revive their careers and partly as an homage to those older films he grew up with. This time around, he has Gordon Liu, who plays the mystical Pai Mei, who trained Bill's elite squad. We see some amazing scenes of The Bride being trained hard by Pai Mei, scenes that are of course reminiscent of all of the wise-master-training-young-hotshot kung-fu films (such as Jackie Chan's Drunken Master). We also see Bo Svenson as the reverend who's about to marry The Bride, and Michael Parks as old Bill friend Esteban Vihaio. Oh, and Sid Haig, whom I last saw in House of 1,000 Corpses, is barkeep at the nudie bar at which Budd's a bouncer.\nAside from the sometimes-turgid pacing, another problem is the soundtrack. There were several times throughout the movie when the music was substantially louder than the dialogue on the screen! Now, I ask you - does that make any sense? Tarantino's always been a stickler for having the right song for the right scene, but come on - if I can't hear his strong dialogue, what's the point?\nI guess this film, in essence, didn't grab me as the first one did. I didn't leave the theater satisfied. I didn't leave with some of my favorite scenes still being played in my mind, over and over again. For me, the movie was flat and fell below expectations. It's still a well-done movie, but it's not up to Vol. 1's excellence."}

She awakes one morning from a fitful sleep to see local deputies on her front step. She's being evicted for failure to pay housing taxes. Stunned, Kathy is suddenly homeless.\nKathy finds a lawyer, but she soon discovers that the house has been sold to a former colonel in the Iranian army (Ben Kingsley), who quickly moves in with his wife Nadi (Shohreh Aghdashloo) and son Esmail (Jonathan Ahdout).\nKathy learns, through her lawyer, that her home was wrongfully seized. The county offers to buy the house back from Col. Behrani, but he refuses - unless his asking price of four times the amount he paid is met.\nAnd so the cycle is set into place. In her mind, Kathy cannot live without the house in which she grew up, the house her father left to her and her brother when he passed away. She must have it back, by any means necessary.\nBut don't think this is nothing more than a revenge/justice thriller. The heavily nuanced characters compel the viewer to feel no small amount of empathy for them, even when they behave poorly. Kathy takes up with a kind deputy named Lester (Ron Eldard), who offers her a place to live while he tries to get her house back. Lester's married, of course, although he claims the marriage ran out of passion a long while back. This is a character we've all seen time and time again - the guy who says it's over and it's just a matter of time before the divorce becomes final - but somehow Eldard slips a few extra layers onto the character, and it's tough to determine if he's Good or Bad.\nAbout two-thirds of the way through the movie, the plot settles into a familiar storyline (which I won't explain here). At that point, I started to think of this as a glorified slasher film. But almost as soon as that through had taken root in my mind, the twists and turns began to shoot at me with intensifying rapidity; it's not immensely difficult to follow the plot, but there are definitely turns that most viewers won't see coming.\n\nThe most pleasant surprise in this movie is Connelly. No longer is she the preternatural heroine of Labryinth; no longer is she the sex object in Career Opportunities. She's now done three incredible movies, movies in which her character was both lush in scope and luscious in appearance: Pollock, A Beautiful Mind, and this one. I'm not shocked that she can turn in such a fine performance, but three times in three disparate movies? Tough to do. She deserves all of the praise she gets.\nThe ending is as compelling as they come, although it's more than a little sad. But unlike movies that have downer endings, this one really hits you in the heart; because each character is both good and bad, one feels conflict where in other films one might feel simple relief or gratification.\n\nHouse of Sand and Fog is an absorbing, riveting psychological drama that pushes all of the right buttons with help of a first-rate script (Andre Dubas III's novel and director Vadim Perelman's screenplay) and a marvelous cast."}

Purple Noon was later remade as The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), with Matt Damon as Ripley, and here The American Friend is remade, with John Malkovich as Ripley.\nIn this story, Ripley's all grown up and has become quite the conniving scoundrel. Phrases like that are best at depicting the completely amoral Ripley, especially when put against a backdrop of Germany and Italy and Old Europe in general. It's not that Ripley doesn't care, it's that... well, okay, it's that Ripley doesn't care.\nRipley's pal Reeves (Ray Winstone) has a job that needs to be done, but when he asks Ripley to handle it, our resident evil-doer demurs - he has a better murderer in mind. Jonathan Trevanny (Dougray Scott) is a framemaker whose son has leukemia. Ah, the perfect man for the job. Ripley offers Trevanny a lot of cash, drawing the innocent into his game.\nThe main problem with the movie is that there's no real urgency, no sense of peril. We understand from the get-go that Tom Ripley's a sociopath, but we're given no clues as to his intentions or motivations. And adding to the ennui is Malkovich himself. Ordinarily, I can't think of anyone better at playing a conniving scoundrel (see him in 1988's Dangerous Liaisons), but Malkovich is so understated in this role that often you can hardly hear what he's saying! For the lead character to be so quiet and unassuming ought to be a federal offense. What was the director thinking?\nBut even if the performance was stronger, the plot itself is rather pedestrian. Oh, sure, you get pretty scenery (it's well photographed), but the twists and turns are really a simple matter of connecting the dots. Almost any fool could see how this one ends."}

Love nicely!", "content": "Romance among the AARP set in a movie is never an easy proposition, pardon the pun. The participants have to be sexy enough that the younger people in the audience don't get all grossed out (\"Gramma and Granpa are KISSING!!! With tongue!!!!\"), but not too sexy. The audience wants to be swept off its feet, but it doesn't want anything that's overly salacious.\nFor the most part, writer-director Nancy Meyers succeeds here. Diane Keaton plays Erica Barry, a neurotic, highly successful playwright. Jack Nicholson plays himself. Okay, technically he plays 63-year-old Harry Sanborn, owner of a hip-hop record label and chronic womanizer.\nOne of the funniest scenes in the movie comes right near the beginning. Harry's with his new squeeze Marin (Amanda Peet), at Marin's mom's house. There's Harry, in his boxers and a t-shirt, putting wine in the 'fridge, when Marin's mom - you guessed it, Erica - unexpectedly comes home. Naturally, she thinks he's an intruder and calls 911. I mean, wouldn't you? It takes some explaining, but soon the misunderstanding is cleared up and our combatants (oops, participants) can get on with the romancin'.\nThe thrust of the story (oops, another pun) is that while fooling around with Marin upstairs, Harry suffers a heart attack. At the hospital, Dr. Mercer (an interestingly cast Keanu Reeves) admonishes the unrepentant Harry for overexerting himself and tells him not to travel for a little while. Yup, you guessed it, that means he has to bunk with Erica. And our romance is thus set up.\nThe good news is that pairing Keaton and Nicholson (who appeared together in 1982's Reds) was a great, great idea. Keaton basically plays a grown-up Annie Hall, and she manages to look sexy and daffy at the same time. Nicholson, for all his bluster and creakiness, still has the panache that has served him so well for the past forty years or so.\nThe trouble is that after their relationship is consummated, the two leads behave like seventh graders. Now, no offense to you seventh graders out there, but you do have a tendency to get melodramatic. Admit it. In this movie, Erica spends - no exaggeration here - a good ten minutes sobbing. And sobbing. And sobbing. Everywhere and anywhere. Yikes and double yikes. For his part, Harry broods like no one's ever brooded before, like he's up for an Olympic medal in the event of Feeling Bummed Out. After a while, you wish these two crazy kids would just get over it. Call her! Call him! Do something!\nTo make matters worse for the relationship, Erica writes a play based on her experiences with Harry, complete with him dancing drunkenly in a hospital gown. Does this lady play hardball, or what?\nGranted, the storyline is predictable, but the two leads are wonderful, and very well cast. Meyers wrote the script with Keaton and Nicholson in mind specifically, the decision was a wise one.\nSomething's Gotta Give has a funny beginning and a sweet ending, but the middle suffers from an unfortunate lag."}

Reluctantly, Maggie Gilkerson (Blanchett) must ask her long-estranged father Samuel (Tommy Lee Jones) to help her track down her daughter. (Samuel shows up at the family homestead early in the film, having been absent from Maggie's life since she was a very small girl.)\nSo there's your basic story. Maggie and Samuel, with the younger daughter Dot in tow, attempt to recover eldest daughter Lily. On the surface, it sounds like any other rescue movie, but there are a couple of interesting elements that set this movie apart from others. \nFor one thing, there's the relationship between Maggie and Samuel. As you can imagine, Maggie's a little bitter at having been abandoned all those years ago, but she needs her father. Samuel, by contrast, isn't the apologizing or  type - yes, a recipe for disaster.\nThe other intriguing element is the theme of mysticism. Maggie is a pious God-fearin' Christian, whereas Samuel is as close to being an American Indian as a white man can get - i.e., he's well attuned to the powers of medicine men and shamans. \nFor me, this movie was carried quite ably by two towering polarizing performances, by Blanchett and Jones. In fact, I think Cate Blanchett was absolutely amazing in this movie. For a woman as beautiful and glamorous as Blanchett is - and can play - her Maggie was as down-and-dirty and multilayered as that of an Oscar-worthy performance. I believe this movie would have been nearly worthless had Blanchett not been cast."}

George Clooney plays a shark-like matrimony lawyer, author of a world-famous, ironclad prenuptial agreement. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays a wily woman in the midst of divorcing her philandering husband (Edward Hermann). Oh, could these two possibly find romance together?\nThe plot's not terribly tough to follow - Clooney's Miles Massey represents Hermann's Rex Rexroth and ensures that Zeta-Jones' Marylin Rexroth gets nothing (rather than half of Rexroth's considerable assets). Marylin, stinging from the loss, plots revenge. And so it goes, in a catty game of cat-and-mouse that leaves the viewer looking for better cheese.\n\nIt's a movie that simply doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it a romantic comedy? A caper movie? A character study? What? \nClooney and Zeta-Jones are more than handsome enough to make the movie work on an eye-candy level, but nothing more. Their performances are agreeable, but nothing approaching the level of actors in other Coen Brothers films. But I won't place all the blame on the shoulders of the actors - this movie seems to have been written and directed out of a paper bag, with little substance and even insufficient style."}

It's about four free-range cowboys who run afoul of a local landowner. There are plenty of cliches in the movie, but evening the odds a bit are a trio of outstanding performances by Costner (the antihero, as always), Duvall (his boss and eminent sage), and Bening (as the woman with whom Costner falls in love. There's a showdown with the bad guys in the middle of a muddy street, and even the saving of a lost puppy as it's about to be washed away by a flood.\nCostner was meant to play roles like this, roles in which the character doesn't say a whole lot and hides his emotions well; see Dances, or Field of Dreams, for example. The quiet-on-the-outside, conflicted-on-the-inside is his idiom, and here he pulls it off marvelously. And, unlike some actor-directors, Costner doesn't spend an inordinate amount of time with closeups of himself. A plus, to be sure.\nBening is a strong counterweight to Costner here; she's the sister of the town doc (initially mistaken for his wife), and she proves to be every bit as commanding in her performance as her character needed to be. It's beautiful to see her and Costner's characters fall gradually in love (well, as gradually as a two-hour movie can get).\nDuvall is a real rock, too - and at past seventy, he often looks tougher than most men a third of his age. This is among his finest work in years."}

That was the Matrix trilogy hitting a giant brick wall.\nI don't want to say that the latest the last installment, Revolutions, is bad, but I hear dentists recently rejected the idea of the movie playing in their waiting rooms because they felt it would drive away their patients.\nRevolutions isn't mind-numbingly awful, though. It's a laugh riot. The trouble is, the Wachowski brothers (who cowrote and codirected) forgot to add any jokes.\nWhen last we left our intrepid, patchwork band of rebels fighting those evil machines that run the Matrix, Neo (Keanu Reeves) was somewhere between the machine world and the real world. Oh, and some guy who apparently was sent to kill him was in a coma.\nMeanwhile, the machines are drilling down to the last outpost of real humanity, the deep-underground city known as Zion, where people have come from all cultures (and, judging from the look of their executive council, all hairstyles as well), people who simultaneously raise their hands either to express defiance or because they're testing a new underarm deodorant. You know these people. They're dirty and yet so pure.\nIt's up to Neo, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) to figure out how to stop the machines, who are led by Sentinels, mosquito-like drones that you just can't swat. Aiding them in their quest is The Oracle, the mystical - if slightly dowdy - psychic played by Mary Alice. Like most of the people in the movie, The Oracle speaks in riddles. But don't worry about understanding her cryptic responses - there's killin' to be done!\nAnd what killing! One scene - the attack of Zion by the machines - takes forever. (I didn't have a watch in the cold, cold theater, but I could have read it by the bright green EXIT sign behind me. A sign that, by the way, looked awfully inviting.) It seems like an entire hour of the two-hour movie is devoted to these things breaking through the outer hull of the underground city and kicking butt. The trouble is, the action moves soquick, it's often tough for the normal human eye to discern who is shooting at whom. It's just madness, utter chaos without any sort of perspective. In short, it's an absolute mess.\n(One of the weapons the humans use in their defense are these giant Transformers-like robots into which the human straps himself - males only; sorry, ladies! - and maneuvers the arms to fire machine guns. But what's the point? The humans themselves are completely vulnerable - they don't even warrant a plastic shield!)\nIn this movie, we see a few familiar characters from the first two movies. There seems to be no need for them - except for The Oracle - other than to complicate the plot. Which is quite odd, because the entire plot itself takes only 30 minutes or so to play out - the rest is sound and fury.\nSome of the dialog - no, make that most - is astoundingly poor. Take that lengthy battle scene, for instance. It's as if the Wachowskis were channeling a screenwriter from old Republic Pictures, the low-budget outfit that produced scads of John Wayne war movies. Nearly every cliche shows up in this one, from the goofy young soldier who screws up but just somehow manages to help save the day to the two soldiers on the run from the machine, with one mowed down while the other just escapes. (I expected a \"no.. go on.. beat those machines!\" before the soldier died.)\nHere's how it breaks down, folks. The first Matrix was wonderful in its mysticism; it was more than bombs burstin' in the air. It was philosophical and quite mysterious. The second one lost a bit of that but still tossed a few curveballs our way.\nBut the third one? Try no mysticism and some of the poorest action scenes in recorded history."}

Scary 3 forgoes the Wayans factor and instead employs the Airplane! factor, as it's directed by David Zucker, part of the creative team behind Airplane!, Hot Shots!, The Naked Gun!, and other exclamatory titles. (Even Leslie Nielsen, who appeared in Airplane! and has made a career out of similar roles, turns up here as well.)\nSo with that pedigree at work, it would be understandable if expectations were a little high for this movie. Let's check the scoreboard. Scary Movie 1: a lot of fun, did a very good job spoofing self-serious horror movies. Scary Movie 2: same crew, awful result - totally immemorable. Scary Movie 3, then, should be as good as if not better than the first movie, if only for the fine comedic chops of the director.\nSM3 parodies three movies, for the most part: The Ring, 8Mile, and Signs. There's also some Matrix tossed in for good measure - these movies are known for their kitchen-sink approach. From The Ring, you have the whole bit about the tape that kills those who watch it and the bit about the girl down the well; from 8Mile, you have the I-wanna-be-a-white-rapper bit, with Simon Rex perfectly pantomiming Eminem; and from Signs you have that whole aliens-are-coming-see-the-crop-circles bit. There are plenty of pop culture references, including an eerie stand-in for Michael Jackson.\n\nThe problem is that the jokes are scattershot, as if someone loaded a BB gun full of humor but removed the casing, thus causing quips and pranks to hit some targets but miss others by a long shot. Movies like this that rely on a fast pace, physical comedy, and a script full of everything the writers can lay their hands on. And because of this reliance, these movies tend to be - exactly like their jokes - hit or miss. For every Hot Shots!, there's a Top Secret!. This is because the law of averages catches up to the screenwriter - not every joke can be funny, and the more jokes are tossed around, the higher the risk that they won't be funny. This doesn't mean it's impossible to have a rapid-fire funny movie - see the aforementioned Airplane! and, for you older-film buffs, movies like His Girl Friday that lived off the rapid-fire humor.\nThe basic plot has bright-eyed TV reporter Cindy (Anna Faris) breaking a story about mysterious crop circles on a farm outside Washington. The owner of the farm, Tom (Charlie Sheen), is a former minister whose wife died in a tragic accident. Meanwhile, people die a week after watching a particular weird videotape. Somehow, it all ties in together.\nSheen seems to be making a living out of lampooning himself and anyone else, and he turns in his usual good work here. At this point in his career, you know what you're going to get from Charlie Sheen. Faris is appealing as the intrepid reporter, exuding both charm and cuteness in equal amounts - but not so much that you'll go into a diabetic shock. Besides Nielsen, among those who show up for small (or even cameo) roles include Pamela Anderson, Jenny McCarthy, Jeremy Piven, Camryn Manheim, Darrell Hammond, Simon Cowell, Denise Richards, Queen Latifah (one of the few who rose above her material), Eddie Griffin, D.L. Hughley, George Carlin, Ja Rule, and a host of rappers, including Macy Ray, Redman, Method Man, Master P, and Raekwon. With all those recognizable, you wind up with a mishmash; the actors and rappers are overwhelmed by their celebrity (except for Latifah, who is clearly slumming) and are nothing more than distractions, for the most part.\nBut even without the myriad celebrity cameos, this is just not a winner. It's not as bad as the second Scary Movie, but it pales in comparison with the first - and it's leagues worse than most of the previous Zucker comedies. There are some funny moments (including a hilarious wake!), and some fine physical comedy, but the film mostly falls flat."}

It's also the most violent.\nIt's not just violent. It's Violent with a capital V. You could even capitalize the entire word, and you still wouldn't be scratching the surface of its violence. You thought Pulp Fiction was violent? Think again, brother. Kill Bill does for bloodletting what Jaws did for shark attacks, what Citizen Kane did for sleds, and what E.T. did for Reese's Pieces. It's so violent, it makes Night of the Living Dead look like Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, even if Fred Rogers donned a ski mask and went psycho with a meat cleaver in the Land of Make Believe.\nI'm harping on the violence here; can you tell? I'm mentioning this because extreme violence is one of those qualities in a film that can divide the audience neatly: those that are repulsed by it, and those who are attracted to it.\nUma Thurman plays a flaxen-haired assassin who's bent on avenging her near death and the murder of her unborn child by the hands of her former elite-assassin teammates. Her story is told out of chronological order, a la Pulp Fiction, but not so jarringly; the audience is helped by onscreen titles explaining what time frame we're in.\nHer character is one of an select group of killers that includes O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), Vernita Green (Viveca A. Fox), Budd (Michael Madsen), and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah); each member goes by a nom de guerre relating to a snake. Thurman's character is Black Mamba.\nHer mission is simple. Find and kill each person who had left her for dead, leaving for the last their ringleader, Bill (David Carradine). Bill does not appear onscreen in this movie, but we do get to hear his voice, like Bosley on Charlie's Angels.\nBut as with most Tarantino films, including those he's influenced, the plot sometimes takes a back seat to style. That doesn't mean there's no substance at all, but with scenes as eye-popping (literally, in one case) as these, it's easy to lose oneself in sheer awe. From the very first scene - a real shocker - to the final, set-em-up scene, you just can't peel your gaze from the machismo and panache being exhibited onscreen.\nThe entire cast is incredible. Thurman's practically an old hand at this, having had a prominent role in Pulp Fiction; here, as the focal point of the movie - the heroine, sort of - she is more than up to the task. I saw nuances in her work here that I'd never seen before. And Lucy Liu? I must come clean and admit I've carried a torch for her for years, but this is easily her best work. Heavily layered, very finely characterized work. (She plays a part-Japanese, part-Chinese, part-American ruler of the Tokyo underworld, and she's damn good with cutlery, too.)\nNow, as you may have guessed, this is not a movie for children. It's also not a movie for pregnant women, people with bad backs (the sudden moves you make when you jump out of your seat might make you slip a disc or two), people with weak hearts, the elderly, and Nervous Nellies. It's for everyone else, though. Boy, is it ever for everyone else! It's a potpourri of balletic swordsmanship, a feast for the eyes (there's that word again). Forget about the violence for a minute - this movie just plain rocks. And Sonny Chiba has a big role, too! You remember Sonny from his 1970s Street Fighter kung fu movies, right? He has a great role here, as the creator of the sword Black Mamba uses against her many enemies.\nYou'll notice the title implies this is not the last we'll see of Black Mamba, and you're right. Yes, it's a movie so big they had to split it in two, and Vol. 2 is due to be released in 2004.\nBut unlike, say, Back to the Future II, which existed purely as a setup for Back to the Future III, this one absolutely stands on its own. And that final scene, which I mentioned earlier, packs one hell of a wallop. I didn't see it coming, although looking back it's not an illogical surprise. (You can predict almost anything in movies if you really think about the movie, but who wants to? You're supposed to experience it as it's played out, not try hard to be three steps ahead of the characters.)\nTarantino's a connoisseur of genre films: caper films, blaxploitation films, martial arts films. His highly stylish touches and imaginative direction place this movie on a pedestal far higher than others of this type. Like Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is in a league completely different from any other film."}

Kelvin has ghosts of his own to deal with, as he is haunted by memories of his wife, a suicide victim. His mission is to find out why the crew members have not come home and to explain their bizarre behavior (as evidenced by their plaintive messages imploring Kelvin to visit).\nThere have been many movies that depict what happens when strange happenings are investigated, and as in most of those movies, nothing here is really as it seems. The tone for the tension and suspense is set almost immediately, as Kelvin awakes onboard the station next to his dead wife!\nWho is she? What is she? Is she really his wife, returned from the grave? What affect does Solaris the planet have on this.... this entitity? Is Kelvin turning as nutty as the remaining crew members? Is he hallucinating his wife? Is he even on the space station - is this a bad dream?\n\nDevoid of outlandish special effects and with a threadbare cast, the movie must lean on the solemn plot and the stoic acting of Clooney. This is his show all the way - his is the flawed hero and the willing victim combined into one multilayered character. It's some of Clooney's best work; he cannot rely on his whiplash smile or suave charm. Neither of those qualities, although surely valuable in other films, can help his character here.\nLike the best thinking-man's sci-fi, Solaris doesn't answer every question. It's mystical without being too abstract, and its quiet strength lies in what one doesn't see.\nThe only drawback is that it's often tough to understand the actions of the crew members, including Kelvin. Are they insane, or merely acting? Hamlet himself may not have been able to discern the truth here. Compounding this is the sometimes unlikeability of Kelvin himself. It would be taking the easy way out, however, to have made him into some sort of superhero. Therefore even though it's tough at times to relate to Kelvin and consequently to root for him to succeed, this is a successful, well-made film, thanks to its complexities and multilayered main character."}

A man answers a ringing phone in a booth in which he's just made a call. A man's voice promises that if he hangs up or leaves the booth, he'll be shot dead.\nIf you were that man, would you have the nerve to hang up?\n\nWhat if you further found out what the potential killer wanted, and it wasn't money or anything on your person? What if he wanted you to apologize for something?\nStu Shepard (Colin Farrell) is a hotshot New York publicist who systematically walks over everyone he meets and lies to those who can help him. He's been carrying on an affair with a struggling actress named Pam (Katie Holmes, looking cute as a  button as always) while married to Kelly (Radha Mitchell). In fact, he's just gotten off the phone with Pam when the phone rings ominously. \"A ringing phone must be answered,\" we're told as the movie opens, although I'm not so certain that's true. I myself feel no strong urge to answer a ringing pay phone, as it's generally not for me.\nBut Stu does answer it, and the voice on the other end (Kiefer Sutherland) has him in his trap. Hang up, you die. But it's not long before other people are involved - otherwise, it'd be a quick or at least awfully dull movie - and sure enough a group of prostitutes wants to use the phone. Only Stu can't hang up, so they get their pimp Leon to take care of things. Leon smashes in the side of the booth, and the killer - provoked according to his own code of what is bad and what is not - shoots him down from above, although we never know quite where.\nAnd that's what really gets things going. Soon the prosties are getting the cops, and there's a big standoff, with Stu still clinging to the phone, refusing to give it up. Of course, the killer is telling him what to say to the cops, warning him that if he doesn't comply, Stu will be killed. In the interests of self-preservation, Stu does comply.\nInterestingly enough, the killer's complaints about Stu center around his perceived selfishness, his look-out-for-number-one attitude. And yet it's that very attitude that keeps Stu alive. If he were the Good Boy that the killer wishes he were (he wants Stu to atone for his past transgressions, such as lying to his wife), then Stu would have been dead. Life's funny sometimes, ain't it?\nOf course, the police have no idea there's a killer on the other end of the phone. They're operating under the assumption that Stu killed the pimp, and that he's armed. In most movies where there's a police standoff, the cops might act a little differently, choosing instead to rush the phone booth. But the cop contingent is led here by Captain Ramey, played by an earnest Forest Whitaker. Whitaker is always a treat to watch, with his hangdog eyes and self-serious expression. He's easily the best part of this otherwise tepid film (much as he was in last year's Panic Room).  Ramey instead chooses to talk Stu down, to discern what the actual threat is. His character is thoughtful but tough, choosing to place himself in danger .\n\nThe movie runs only 81 minutes, but it's still too long and probably would have been better served as an episode of an anthology series, like the old Twilight Zone or Outer Limits series. It's interesting to see the character development of Stu Shepard, but in the end the viewer still doesn't care too much about him."}

You decide", "content": "Some of you out there will undoubtedly recall The Gong Show, that harbinger of wacky reality-TV shows that appeared in the seventies. Others will remember such earlier game show gems as The Dating Game and The Newlywed Game. The same guy was responsible for all three: Chuck Barris.\nThis film is based on Barris's \"unauthorized autobiography of the same name. In it, he details his rise to and fall from fame and fortune. That in and of itself would make the movie no different than any other bio-pic. But the hook in Barris's book is that he was a deep, deep undercover CIA agent during the time he was running these game shows.\nNow, we don't know if that last part is factually accurate. It's not as if we can ask the CIA if Chucky worked for them way back when. If he did, they'd never tell us. If he didn't, they'd never tell us. (I think it's unlikely, but who knows?)\nBut happily for all of us, one doesn't have to completely buy into the notion that this actually happened. The movie doesn't take itself seriously, so you either remain skeptical of the CIA angle or go with the flow. Either way, the story entertains. \nBarris is very well played by Sam Rockwell. The guy looks and behaves exactly like Barris did back in the day. Rockwell is very appealing, offering a genuine, accurate portrait of the impresario. On the other hand, Drew Barrymore plays his paramour, Penny. Barrymore has never been and never will be the finest of actresses, but she did turn in satisfactory work here. (Of course, if you remember your grade school days, \"satisfactory\" wasn't necessarily a good thing.) Maybe it's just me, but it seems that every character Barrymore plays nowadays comes off as annoying and not particularly useful. Either the characters are just plain annoying as written, or they're fairly one-dimensional until Barrymore adds her special brand of annoyingness to them. Either way, the film doesn't exactly light up when she's onscreen. At times, her line delivery is really awful, as if she'd never bothered to learn the craft of acting. It just seems at times that she's still playing off - perhaps subconsciously - the \"cute little girl\" persona she enjoyed as a child.\nGeorge Clooney directed this, his first such foray, and he gave himself a rather plum role as Jim Byrd, the CIA agent who recruits Barris to do dirty work. It's a good role, but Clooney tries so hard to underplay it - thus ensuring that he doesn't steal a scene from the lesser-known Rockwell - that often you can barely hear what he's saying! I should never have to turn the volume up to hear someone speak, only to have to turn it back down when someone else has a line. \nSeveral of Clooney's movie star pals show up, most in small roles. Julie Roberts has a rather substantial role as a fellow agent, and she does a pretty good job. Like Clooney, she doesn't overplay her part; she interacts neatly with Rockwell, and they have very good chemistry together.\n\nThe story itself moves along pretty well, and the nostalgics out there will be pleased to know that some people from the era show up as themselves, such as Dick Clark, Jaye P. Morgan, and Gene Gene the Dancing Machine. These people show up in interviews during the movie itself, which was jarring at times (that is, after an action scene you'd suddenly see one of these luminaries talking about Chuck Barris the person and discussing whether he really did work for the CIA).\nTo sum up: intriguing storyline, excellent lead performance, decent if not particularly noteworthy supporting performances, and good direction. On the negative side, the pace was sometimes choppy - too slow at times."}

As such, it's a popcorn movie - throw that ol' Pop Secret in the microwave and get prepared to have that knowing smirk wiped off your face. This isn't a tame, placid movie in which the killers aren't seen; it's an all-out gore fest that delights in shocking, or at least in attempting to shock.\nMuch of the plot has been lifted from countless drive-in movies. Four teens are driving across the country, collecting information for a book one of them is writing about odd roadside attractions. They stop for gas at a place called Spaulding's, run by a half-mad misfit (Sid Haig) who sometimes dresses as an evil clown. The young quartet, after gassing up, takes a \"tour of evil\" behind the store, and here they learn about a half-mythical being known as Dr. Satan. Thinking this might be good fodder for their book, the kids ask Captain Spaulding (you oldtime movie buffs should catch that reference) if he can direct them to where Dr. Satan now resides. The wacko is glad to oblige.\nBut of course, it's dark, and then it's rainy, and then they pick up a sexy hitchhiker, and then the tire blows. And wouldn't you know it, the kids forgot the spare. So the hitchhiker (Sheri Moon) who says she lives down the street, says she'll get her brother to bring his tow truck around. Which means it's not too long before our four \"normal\" kids are stranded in a spooky house in the middle of the night during a harsh rainstorm.\n\nThe Firefly family is a tad on the peculiar side, from young harlot Baby (Moon) to old harlot Mother Adrienne (Karen Black) to Otis (Bill Moseley), who looks a lot like Riff-Raff from The Rocky Horror Picture Show, to Granpa (Dennis Fimple). Naturally, it's not long before these meddling kids want to get out of there. FAST.\nHouse of 1,000 Corpses is not a movie built strongly on a foundation of irrefutable plot development. It's signature is style, and director/screenwriter Rob Zombie bathes the movie in an absolute orgy of it, complete with dismemberments and scalpings and many other horrific elements. There's plenty of blood and gore, and as long as you can convince yourself it's not actual gore, you might find this a fun movie.\n\nLet me pause right there. Some of you are probably scratching your heads. \"A fun movie?\" you ask. Death and dismemberment is fun? Sure, in a creepily exotic way. The idea of the movie isn't to see how the kids can escape the horror, it's to see how many unique and interesting ways they can be tortured. All right, so that's a little sick. I admit it. I have a bloodthirst when it comes to some movies. If I'm in the right mood, a gory film (see Dead Alive, by Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson to learn about fun with a lawnmower) is perfect.\nThis is all a roundabout way of explaining that this movie is not for all audiences, but then again the title alone should alert you to that. It's probably a bad idea to let young, impressionable kids watch this. I say \"probably,\" only because perhaps you don't mind your Timmy growing up thinking slaughtering young people is okey dokey.\nIt's not a movie for the weak of heart. Please don't watch this if you're pregnant; it may induce laughter. You see, when this came out to poor reviews, I figured the big problem was that it was laughable. It's not laughable - you just have to be in a precise frame of mind for it. I hope Zombie makes more of these.\nOh, and here's an interesting bit of trivia. One of the four teens is played by Chris Hardwick, who once upon a time cohosted the MTV game show Singled Out!"}

Chicago won six Oscars (including Best Picture) at this year's ceremony, and it was nominated for seven more. It's rare that a movie could be so widely praised and still not be be very good, and happily for the home viewer, that doesn't happen here, either.\nChicago is the story of Roxie Hart (Rene Zellweger), a married woman on trial for killing her boyfriend. Her husband Amos (John C. Reilly) stands by her, but Roxie aspires to be more than a housewife - she wants to be a big Star like her idol, Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who's also currently in stir for murder. Roxie is defended by the magnificently egotistical megalomaniac Billy Flynn, who had been Velma's lawyer, too.\nIt's not always easy to transform a musical to the big screen. Movie audiences tend to tune out big production numbers, because our attention spans just aren't what they used to be. Also, it's harder to capture the pomp and circumstance of a big musical production in a movie than it is on a stage. On stage, your audience is rapt, captive to the sounds and smells of the entertainment afore them. On the screen, it's all visual. In addition, the grand old era of big musicals is long gone - MGM Studios had an entire division devoted to it back in the forties and fifties. But times have changed, and the audience with them.\nDirector Rob Marshall, whose first big film this was, brought a career in choreography to the project, and he succeeded tremendously. The dramatic apexes of the movie are told in song and dance, and never for a moment does the viewer imagine he is anywhere but in the jail, the courtroom, Roxie's apartment, or wherever the scene is set. That's a testament to the wonderful camerawork, the lively and photogenic choreography, and the bravura performances turned in by the cast. Each scene is more mesmerizing than the last, and the set pieces alone are really jaw-dropping.\n\nBut aside from all that supplemental stuff, there's the cast itself. Each cast member performed his or her own singing and dancing. Zeta-Jones is a trained singer and dancer; the rest of the cast needed lessons, but it doesn't show. In particular, I was duly impressed with Zellweger's vocal range and showmanship; even Richard Gere - long on my list of Poor Actors - shone. And none in this triumphant trimuverate turned in the plum performance of the show - that would be Queen Latifah, who was herself nominated for an Oscar as Mama Morton. Of course, Latifah is an accomplished singer and has been for some time, but her work her was absolutely powerful.\nRecommending musicals can be treacherous work. Guys will turn up their noses or grunt (or both) and dismiss any musical as a chick flick. Don't do it, guys, don't do it. You get to see three sexy women (four, if you count the exotic Lucy Liu, one of my personal all-time favorites) oozing scandal, intrigue, and sensuality; it's not as if they're sitting around discussing the latest woman-in-peril movie on Lifetime. There's violence AND sex. Okay, the sex is way, way, way offscreen. But it's still naughty, trust me."}

It's a science-fiction movie that emphasizes fiction over all; that is, the physics of the film don't hold up to snuff. If you're an engineer or physicist, you should be smart enough not to watch it - you'll just spend most of your time second-guessing the inane psuedoscience.\n\nIt seems the inner core of the Earth has stopped spinning, for some reason, and this has caused the electromagnetic  field that surrounds and protects the planet to begin to decompose. This is evidenced by, among other things, pigeons in Tralfagar Square in London suddenly veering at plate-glass windows and sundry people who wish they were extras in a less-violent movie, like Daddy Daycare or maybe Finding Nemo. At any rate, the world's leading scientists, commissioned by the military (it wouldn't be a Save the Planet from Imminent Destruction without our pals in the movie military), figure out that the core's stopped rotating, and that Something Must Be Done to get it going again.\nAh, but what? We've only drilled down about 8 miles, and according to my calculations the distance from the surface to the core is .... a bit further. We must drill down, sayeth the sage scientists, and lo and behold, through the magic of movies, there's this guy in the desert who's been working on a laser rocket thingy that'll help them blast all the way down. This handy little thing is just the cure, so a crew is hastily assembled: Commander Iverson (Bruce Greenwood), Major Beck Childs (Hilary Swank), Dr. Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart), Dr. Serge Leveque (Tcheky Karyo), Dr. Conrad Zimsky (Stanley Tucci), and Dr. Ed Brazzelton.\nLike such doomsday movies as Armageddon, what The Core has going for it are likeable characters and a lot of nifty FX. It also has the unknown working for it; we don't know what lies beneath the thin crust of the Earth, because we haven't drilled beyond it. That allows filmmakers a lot of free reign to depict whatever the heck they want in terms of What's Down There.\nWhat The Core has going against it, however, is a predictable plot and some howlingly awful dialog. Now, it's not giving anything away to mention that at least one person doesn't make it back from this mission. It's also not giving anything away to note that there's at least one knockdown, drag-out hissy fit of a scene in which Keyes admonishes Childs for something she didn't do. It's hysterical to watch, although I suspect the emotion the director was attempting to convey was more like empathy, not euphoria. Or ennui, which is unfortunately how some of the movie felt.\nThe Core is cheesy. No, not the actual inner core - although, come to think of it, maybe it is, since we don't know for sure what it's made of. And wouldn't that be fitting? A cheesy core for a cheesy film made by cheesy people in a cheesy society? Who's up for some Muenster?"}

You know the type. Several disparate types are stranded on an island or in an old mansion or a broken-down hotel, and it's raining cats and dogs outside, and wouldn't you know it, but they're being picked off, one by one. But beyond the obvious setup, this isn't anything like And Then There Were Young or its myriad imitations. This has a few twists, including an outstanding one right near the end. \nSeveral people wind up at a ramshackle motel in the middle of nowhere. It's pouring rain. The road's been flooded both ways, so no one can get out. Among the stranded are a limo driver (John Cusack) and his employer-actress (Rebecca DeMornay), an irascible cop (Ray Liotta) and the convict he's chaperoning (Jake Busey), a prostitute (Amanda Peet), a newlywed couple, and a man (John C. McGinley) and his family, complete with a mute son.\nPretty disparate, all right. But trouble's afoot from the get-go, as Cusack, blinded by the torrential rain, runs over McGinley's wife, causing severe injuries. As the woman slips in and out of consciousness, Cusack must rush to the hospital to get an ambulance (phone's out, of course, and she can't be moved). But then it's flooded, see, and... well, everyone winds up back at the motel. \nSometimes thrillers explain themselves a bit too well - and too often - and the viewer has too much of an idea what's coming. Telegraphing what's to happen to a character is one of the biggest flaws of most thrillers, and if the viewer stops and thinks about the movie, the movie's sunk. Once thought enters the viewers mind, the holes in the plot are as familiar as Swiss cheese.\nBut the plot in Identity holds up very well, thanks in no small part to a great cast. Normally, in ensemble pieces like this the cast is comprised of once-great or once-pretty-good actors, people you've heard of but not lately. But Identity's cast is peppered with names familiar for their recent talents, and not their tabloid prowess. For instance, what's Cusack doing here? Isn't he slumming? Yes..... and no. It's a murder thriller, but he elevates the movie far beyond its rudimentary whodunit origins.\nCusack's great - I've yet to see him be awful - but he's not the only one with a bravura performance. Liotta's turn as the cop is gritty (he's no stranger to the role, playing a similar one in Unlawful Entry) and ultimately believable, and McGinley's a lot better than the underwritten role he was handed. Also shining is Peet as the hooker - I've never really liked her, but she did a good job with a good role.\nAnd the atmosphere is wonderful! It felt like it was raining in my apartment. I jumped when they jumped, and I cringed when they cringed. That's good camerawork.\nThe good aspects are the ending, the ending, the acting, the ending, and the atmosphere; the bad aspect is the middle stuff, as a lot of the movie is slasherific. \nBut the ending is excellent, in case I forgot to mention it. The only thing I will tell you is that the standard \"everyone dies\" mantra begun by some guy named Shakespeare or something doesn't hold true here.\n\nMy score: ***"}

You know, I remember when Arnold was mighty enough to warrant a Fourth of July opening for his movies, but apparently his studio is happy with the movie's being buried in a sea of zap!bam!pow! action movies.\nAh, but enough carping about the timing. Let's get to the nitty gritty, shall we?\nPeople fall into three categories. First, there are the ones who have never seen a Terminator film. Those people aren't likely to watch this third installment. Then there are the ones who thought the second one was better than the first. Those people will probably think this one's not as good as the second, but about on par with the first. And then thee are those who thought the first one rocked like a mighty cradle; those people might be disappointed and will probably crow to the rest of us that sequels are always bad and that the original is always better.\nHere's the story, kids. The scene is a few years after Terminator 2. In that movie, John Connor was 11 years old. Now he's more like 14 or 15. He's on his own, pretty much bumming around the country, doing odd jobs, always on the run, that sort of thing. And somehow he runs into the Terminator along the way.\nNow, you might remember the Terminator as being Bad in the first movie and Good in the second. When John meets him, he doesn't know which attitude will be taken by the robot. So why is the T-800 (Arnold) back? Well, he said he'd be. But more importantly, he's here to protect John once again. And from whom, you might ask? From a T-X, a female Terminator, sent back in time by the machines in the future to kill John's lieutenants.\nSee, the machines don't know where John is in this present time. They do have a fix on the whereabouts of the people who will become his top deputies when he finally leads the resistance. Their theory, then, is to kill them off, hoping to thwart the rebellion by man before it really develops.\nFunny thing, though. The homeless John breaks into a veterinary clinic to get some medicine, and it just so happens that working at the clinic is Kate Brewster, who is to be one of his lieutentants. The T-X arrives there to rub Kate out and stumbles upon John, and that's when Arnold shows up.\nThe second Terminator movie had a huge budget, and the money was wisely spent on special effects, effects that were state-of-the-art in 1991. Now, CGI is all the rage, so the effects aren't so special. So to make up for a lack of innovation, the filmmakers (not James Cameron, who made the first two movies) throw in a lot of crashes, explosions and other loudnesses. In fact, there's a long, long car/truck chase scene near the very beginning that's pretty well done - but overlong. And, unfortunately, it occurs before the plot can really be set in place.\nThe movie itself isn't very long - two hours is nothing for an action movie. A little more plot padding would have made me feel better about it.\nBut back to the movie as a whole. Nick Stahl plays John now (it was Edward Furlong in the second, in his debut), and he does a great job. He looks a lot like Ed Furlong probably looks now. Kate Brewster is played by Claire Danes. Yes, Claire Danes! A bit of an unusual role for her, but she can do plucky and empathetic. And of course, Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the T-800, the original Terminator. There's one cameo by a character who had a big role in the second Terminator movie, and it's a funny one, too.\nWill you enjoy this movie? I think you will, but it's not going to blow you away like the first or second may have. Arnold carries this movie for the most part, because he doesn't have Linda Hamilton from the other films (as John's mother, Sarah) to help him out. Hamilton was a big reason that T2 was so successful - her role made it more than a Guys Smash Stuff movie. This one doesn't quite escape that fate, however."}

These movies allow us to be distracted by the cool special effects, and plot is a distant second priority. The focus is on Our Hero and how he will Save the Day. But the quiet ones, oh, their stupidity is glaring, like a boil that desperately needs lancing. \nThe Recruit has a nifty premise. James Clayton (Colin Farrell) is recruited to become a CIA agent by Walter Burke (Al Pacino). Burke tells Clayton and the other recruits several times at a super-duper-secret facility known as The Farm that nothing is as it appears, and they should trust no one. Sadly, our intrepid hero doesn't remember this from scene to scene. James, naturally, falls for a fellow recruit, Layla (Bridget Moynahan),  and it's not long before Burke uses her to \"test\" James.\nThere are some wrinkles afoot. For one thing, James lost his dad years ago in a mysterious helicopter accident. Was the elder Clayton working for the CIA? He's not sure. By the time this movie's over, you might not be too sure, either, and unfortunately, you won't care.\nIf a movie is highly dependent on plot twists and turns, it must make those twists plausible. Overanalyzing a movie is never a good thing, because doing so takes all the fun out of watching them in the first place. This is why it's perfectly okay for an action movie to be implausible - we don't need it to be so for us to enjoy it.\nBut The Recruit must be plausible for it to be enjoyable, and there were several moments during the movie where the \"oh, come ON\" quotient was very high. \"Oh, come ON!\" I cried to the dog next to me. \"Why would he do that?\" or \"Oh, come ON! Man, James is an idiot for not figuring this out!\"\nYou see, if I can be several steps ahead of the hero plotwise, that's not a good thing. It means that the screenwriters (in this case, Roger Towne and Kurt Wimmer) were lazy and couldn't be bothered with a story that made sense. And to top it off, the hook of \"is it real or is it a fake?\" simply isn't effective when it's overplayed. The audience doesn't like it when you tell them things aren't as they seem and then follow it up by making everything not what it seems. We need something to hang on to.\nAnother thing that irked me a little bit was how dumb some of the characters were. This would be fine if the characters were supposed to be bumbling oafs, but these were allegedly CIA recruits! They're awfully obtuse for people who should be able to think themselves out of situations.\n\nAs for the acting, well; this is the first time in a while I can remember Al Pacino being outhammed. Pacino runs hot in cold; sometimes he's Acting Al, getting deep into his character, and other times he's Crazy Al, simply overacting. The latter wins in this case, but Farrell easily outhams him. Every emotion is overdone to the point where we as an audience find it tough to root for him. Then again, I'm sure there are many out there who don't give a darn how well Farrell acts. But if it's a pretty boy you're looking for, let's try to keep them contained to pretty boy movies, not supposedly slick thrillers.\nThe Recruit is quite long (155 minutes), and might have been improved if it had been shortened by about an hour.  It's overblown, overdone, and a waste of talent and a good idea."}

The new leader of the Romulans seems to have an interesting relationship to Picard. Is he for real? Is he a good guy looking to help his people, or is he an evil despot, bent on destroying all?\nCompared with other films in the TNG series, this one is one of the weaker entries. This doesn't mean it's not entertaining in spots, and the cast isn't just going through the motions. But the plot is weak, even if the special effects aren't. I liked this movie better than some of the old-school Star Trek films, like the first, third, and fifth ones, but not as much as First Contact and Generations from the new set.\n\nThe characters remain believable and are faithful to the canon. Picard is a quick-thinking leader who is never unwilling to allow others the chance to run things - as opposed to Kirk, who let everyone know who was in charge at all times. Picard, much better at solving problems and delegating authority, is the better leader by far.\nI haven't yet checked to see if there will be an eleventh Star Trek film, but a few things make me wonder.

If you haven't, you're going to be lost. There's a lot in here that depends on the plot of the original. So please, go see the original before seeing this sequel.\nThe Matrix itself is basically everything you see - the entire planet, the movie says, is controlled by machines. Only a select few know this, and their mission in life is to free the minds of others who are enslaved by the Matrix, leading them to the city of Zion, located about the Earth's core.\nOne of the chief rebels is Morpheus, played by Lawrence Fishburne. Morpheus, in the original movie, thinks he's stumbled upon The One, the person who can save Zion and the rest of humanity from the Matrix. That would be Neo, played by Keanu Reeves.\nAs the second movie opens, the machines have discovered Zion and are tunneling to it. It's only a matter of time before they tunnel through and kill all those inside. But rather than fortify the defenses of the city, Morpheus believes in the prophecy of The One. He defies the orders of the city's elders and brings Neo back to the surface (that is, the Matrix) so that he can meet with the wise Oracle.\nAre you confused yet? There are many themes here, some of which are philosophical and metaphysical in nature. One can view this movie on two fronts: as a gritty action movie or as a thought-provoking drama.\nReloaded is replete with some eye-opening special effects, many of which were computer generated. In one scene, Neo combats the evil Agent Smith. Oh, but not just one Agent Smith - 100 of them at once. It's not like those cheesy kung fu movies where the villains take turns beating up on Bruce Lee; in this one, they attack simultaneously. Another scene features a fight atop a tractor-trailer on a crowded freeway.\nIt's tough to convey all of the complexities of the plot. In fact, this is a movie that people - like the original - will need to watch multiple times just to catch all of the plot twists. What does it all mean? And even more important, what's it all leading to? This is the second movie of the series, with the third one coming out in November this year.\nRather than delve into the intricacies of the storyline, let me give you some pros and cons. If you're a fan of the series, you're going to go no matter what I say, and if you thought the first one was a waste or not for you anyway, you won't be going to this one.\nLet's look at the acting. It's wooden. Keanu Reeves was born to play this role, as it requires little to no emoting. Plus, he looks cool in shades and a trenchcoat. I'll admit it, he looks very good, and in the non-computer-generated fight scenes, he looks somewhat plausible.\n\nHis love interest, the mysterious Trinity, is played by Carrie-Anne Moss. Another one who simply cannot act, so she fits right in. Now, this may be a simple matter of personal tastes, but she's astoundingly unattractive. She's Neo's love interest, and yet the two of them have absolutely no chemistry. It's like watching a totem pole and a mop mate. Eew.\nEven Fishburne didn't come off perfectly. Some of his lines sound like they came off a cereal box top. Sure, that's no fault of Larry, but his delivery had the resonance of a funeral dirge. He's a very commanding figure, though, and he does deliver a solid performance as Morpheus.\nOkay, so maybe the acting isn't wonderful. Who cares, right? You don't watch these movies for the emoting. Let's see some tail being kicked!\nThe action sequences are very good, although not quite as overwhelming as those in the original. There are some additions - Agent Smith can replicate, and Neo can now fly. The flying thing is key, but quite frankly he just looks like Superman with a different color cape. Even so, the sequences themselves are good. The problem is that sometimes they seemed to be thrown into the movie for no real reason other than to have an action scene. Another problem is that these scenes seemed to come right from a Nintendo game. You know, the type where you hit something like up and right and the B button to do a freaky Street Fighter move on someone? Plus several times in each scene, the action is paused so that the audience can get the full effect, since everyone's moving so quickly.\nAnother big difference between this movie and the original is that although the original was pretty philosophical itself, it expressed philosophical themes with tangible objects, such as the pills and the spoon. You see? We normal folk can grasp those concepts when the themes are expressed in that manner. But the second film relies more on abstract concepts, and that might lose people who don't have doctorates in Jungian theories.\nThe ending is a little bit of a downer, but since we know it's leading up to the third film, we shouldn't feel particularly let down. Yes, it's \"to be continued,\" but this movie more than stands on its own. Think of it more as an episode."}

The newly betrothed fiancee realizes she has some unfinished business, though, in the form of the redneck hillbilly backwoods husband she left seven years prior. \nMelanie Carmichael (Reese Witherspoon) is riding high. Her recent fashion show went off perfectly, and the man of her dreams (Patrick Dempsey) has asked her to marry him. One problem - she needs to get her husband Jake (Josh Lucas) to sign the divorce papers. So she hightails it down to Alabamy, anxious to get the papers signed so she can get on with her life.\nAh, but not so fast. Jake's not letting her off the hook that easily. Nope, first he calls the cops on her, since she appropriates his spare key and enters his (their) house. When the sheriff discovers they're still married, though, he holds up his hands and calls it a domestic dispute. Jake won't sign the papers, he says, because she's turned into a a high-class, highfalutin, effete snob. Ok, those are my words, not Jakes, but you get the picture. Our little girl has some growing up to do!\nMuch of the plot has to do with culture clash - Melanie walking down Main Street gabbing on a cell phone, Melanie in a honkytonk bar shootin' pool while women with babies linger nearby. This is all that Melanie left when she escaped from her tiny hometown seven years ago to make it on her own, and naturally at first she can do nothing more than turn up her nose at everything in the hamlet.\nAh, but of course she's due for her comeuppance, and that's where Jake and the rest of the town come in. Someone must be Taught a Lesson, else it wouldn't be much of a movie. Jake refuses to sign the papers so Melanie can be Taught a Lesson. \nA movie like this has to be taken for what it is - a dumb comedy. It doesn't pretend to be anything fancy or all-important. It's not self-involved or overly pensive. It's a simple plot driven by simple characters, buttressed by a traditional soundtrack.\nThe movie's buoyed by some appealing performances, but Witherspoon's isn't one of them. I've often considered Reese Witherspoon to be nothing more than a flavor of the month blonde, because she offers no real nuance to her acting - everything's broadly done. Her characters in Legally Blonde, Election, and Sweet Home Alabama bear striking similarities. Sure, maybe she's being typecast, but if that's the case, perhaps she needs to try something that'll stretch her talents a little.\nNo, the best performance is by Josh Lucas as Jake. Lucas's piercing eyes and laid-back grin serve him well as Jake, whose upbringing and background belie (in the eyes of Melanie, at least) a wealth of intelligence, wisdom, and depth. Lucas is very appealing here, knowing but not omniscient; able to love but stubborn - much like the stereotypical southern man, come to think of it. Lucas doesn't come off as a typical pretty boy, though, unlike Dempsey as Melanie's intended. Even so, this is a major improvement over the Patrick Dempsey we've seen in the past (Loverboy, Meatballs 3, Run, Mobsters). He's assured and polished, just not highly developed.\nThis is a popcorn film that's aimed at people looking for a few good chuckles. With any culture-clash movie, you're bound to get some laughs because the viewer is apt to be on one side of the cultural fence or the other and therefore will find something to which he or she can relate. Happily, the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, as well it shouldn't, considering the characters are cardboard cutouts and the plot is predictable.  This kind of simplistic movie usually works fine, but the abrasiveness of Melanie brings the whole film down a couple of notches."}

Sullivan's very effective at his job, and he's equally effective in keeping his true occupation from his young sons. On one fateful night, however, son Michael (Tyler Hoechlin) stows away on one of his father's business trips and witnesses a slaying. Knowing the boy has seen far too much, Rooney's own son decides to kill him - but gets the wrong boy (not to mention his mother).\nSo the Michaels young and old are on the run. Sullivan wants to get back at the man who killed his family, and that journey can only lead to one man - John Rooney. \nThere are several problems with this movie. The first is - surprisingly - in the casting. Hanks isn't wrong for the part of Michael Sullivan, but there's also no real need for him to play the part, either. He's okay, but he's just not as effective as Tom Hanks usually is. For someone who's such a great and accomplished actor, Hanks had no need to take on this role, which conceivably could have been played by most actors in America.\nPaul Newman isn't any better. I know, sacrilege! Newman's been in Hollywood for a long, long time, and he's one of my all-time favorite performers. But the man's getting old. I don't mean he's aging gracefully, although he had been doing that for many years. I mean he looks old - in this movie, he looked very haggard and weary, as if he had been working on the movie nonstop for seven months. There's none of that old fire and passion we've come to expect from Newman. There's one scene in particular near the end in which his character confronts Hanks's character, and - no lie here - he sounded like he was on Death's door.\nOh, I know. He IS an old man. Newman's 78 years old, now. But I've never seen him look and sound as bad as he did in this movie. The last movie I saw him in was Message in a Bottle (1999), in which he played Kevin Costner's cantankerous father. And he was very, very good in that movie. He was funny, self-deprecating, engaging, and magnificent - aging gracefully, if you will. But this movie's like the anathema to Message.\nImagine, a movie with Hanks and Newman! New guard and old guard! It should have been a real meeting of the thespians, a chance to compare the styles of two of the greatest ever to walk onto the silver screen. But it's a major disapointment, this acting summit. Hanks is earnest but a little insincere, and Newman looks like he's walking in his sleep.\nWhat makes this movie even more disappointing is the fact that it was directed by Sam Mendes, who wrote and directed American Beauty (1999). This is his first film since Beauty, but there's none of the nuances of that masterpiece evident in this one. Was he just happy to work with acting legends? \nThere are some interesting, almost random funny moments, as when Michael, Jr. learns to drive the getaway car (they're on the lam, remember), but overall it's a bleak, uninspiring film.  At least the title is appropriate, as \"Perdition\" means \"eternal damnation,\" which is what watching this movie sometimes felt like."}

Down goes Igby!", "content": "This is the movie that proves that Macaulay Culkin isn't and wasn't the best Culkin actor. Kieran Culkin, now 20 years old, is spot on as the iconoclastic Jason \"Igby \" Slocumb, Jr., wild child in a very odd family. Think Malcolm in the Middle in which everyone, including Malcolm, is a bit wacky. No, wait, calling the Slocumbs wacky isn't quite fair. Let me explain.\nMother Mimi (Susan Sarandon) is a snobby upper-crust matriarch who's dying of breast cancer. Brother Ollie (Ryan Phillippe) follows in her footsteps - except for the dying part, of course. Father Jason (Bill Pullman) is suffering from schizophrenia and resides in a sanitarium, though we see him in the occasional flashback.\nBecause of Igby's upbringing, he's transformed himself into a sort of rebel against everything. He gets kicked out of public schools and private schools alike. In desperation, his mother sends him to military school, which works for a while.\nSo Igby's grown up in a lifestyle of opulence - he has money, he has all the material obsessions anyone could want, and of course he wants something else:  nothing. He wants to escape the clutches of his domineering mother and protective (to a fault) brother. He wants to be his own person, see his own sights, and live life as best he can. Trouble is, he's penniless until his mother dies.\nIgby's travels take him far and wide, partially aided by the benevolence of his obscenely wealthy godfather, D. H. (Jeff Goldblum). This enables him to escape, for a time, from his schools and his family.\nSo what's the point of all of this \"escaping,\" you ask? After all, he's part of the elite of society, and although escaping from it sounds like fun for a time, is it worth a 90-minute exposition? I think it was, at least in this particular case. I've never been a strong fan of costume dramas - which is what this is, sans period costumery - but I think that the idiosyncrasies and overall oddness of Igby and his family make up for the familiarity of the script. Culkin, in his first \"adult\" role (I remember him best as the youngest child in \"Father of the Bride\") is very well cast, showing us that acting is just as important as being cute and cuddly - in essence, he was able to do what his older brother Mac couldn't, and that's act after hitting puberty. Kieran Culkin's no longer the cute little kid, and that's good - it should work in his favor, not hamper him. \nTrue, the script is a little pedestrian, but there are just enough oddball moments to keep the viewer interested. Sometimes screenwriters will try to make a character as weird as possible, and that just leaves the viewer cold, with no way to relate to the character. Igby's character works because he's believable and because he's not infallible."}

We drop it off, pick up our little claim ticket, and then go shopping for an hour or so. But for the photo technician, who sees hundreds and hundreds of daily life pictures, each snapshot is a glimpse into another person's world, whether it's a birthday party for an eight-year-old boy or softcore porn for a local entrepreneur. \nSeymour Parrish (Robin Williams) has been developing photos at the SavMart for many, many years. He's cheerful and friendly to his customers (and he does consider them to be \"his\" customers), and he knows his stuff when it comes to the technical aspects of the job. See, Sy's no mere clerk, although that's how you and I and most other people see him; he's a qualified, experienced technician. So much so that he gets into a brief shouting match with the guy who delivers Agfa developing equipment over a minor discrepancy in the machine.\nSy lives alone; he's middleaged and has no friends or close family. He doesn't even have a dog. What he does have, though, is the opportunity to live his life through the pictures his customers have taken, from birthday parties to sex games to vacations to any and all events in people's lives.\n\nThere's one family in particular through which Sy lives vicariously the most often: Nina and Will Yorkin, with son Jake (age 8). Sy's been developing the Yorkins' photos sinec before Jake was born, and he's been able to watch the boy grow.\nThis might seem to be a normal obsession, right? At least as normal as obsessions can be, anyway. But Sy, as you may have guessed, is a little different. He has an entire wall in his house devoted to the Yorkin family. Over the past decade or so, whenever he's developed prints for Mrs. Yorkin, Sy has made a copy for himself. As a result, there are thousands and thousands of photos on the wall from the Yorkin family.\t\nWhen the store manager (Gary Cole) discovers the discrepancy between the number of prints produced and the number that have been actually paid for, he confronts Sy, and the downward spiral begins. Sy's obsession with his surrogate family intensifies as he descends even deeper into madness.\nBut he's not just a creepy loner, although that's a big part of his character makeup. Sy feels a certain kinship with the family - at least with Mrs. Yorkin and Jake - and also feels protective of them. So when he comes across some damaging photos, that descent into madness accelerates rapidly.\nIs this a good role for Williams? In his recent turn in Insomnia, he was creepy and not at all the hyperkinetic funnyman we all know, and he was very effective at essaying deep emotions. The same holds true here. In fact, I think this is among the best work Williams has ever turned in. He's mesmerizing as Sy, making him not into an unfeeling monster but rather into an obsessive man with a warped sense of values. \nThe other actors are well cast, too, especially Gary Cole as his boss and Connie Nielsen as Nina Yorkin. But it's Williams's show, and while in olden days he might have turned this into a tour-de-force, pull-out-the-stops performance, in One Hour Photo Williams takes a very effective subtle approach. He underplays Sy just enough to let the audience know what he's feeling and what his motivations are without beating them over the head with it.\nThe story moves along very well, and the film is exceptionally photographed (so to speak). The original music by Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek is fantastic and - best of all - appropriate to the movie, which is a rare treat."}

But danger's afoot for the boy wizard. Before the start of his second year, Harry is visited by a House Elf named Dobby. Dobby warns Harry not to return to Hogwarts, but of course Harry doesn't heed his warning. Besides, he must escape from the clutches of his cruel, nasty adoptive family.\nSo Harry's busted out from his imprisoned bedroom by Ron and his brothers in their flying car. It occurs to me here that this is a movie that might be just a little bit far out and trippy if viewed while under an influence not quite the same as reality. Ron's flying car takes the boys back to their family's house; unlike Harry's adoptive parents, Ron's parents are both magical practitioners; purebred magicians, if you will. It is with the Weasley family that Harry returns to the school.\nBut alas and alack! Ron and Harry miss the train back to Hogwarts! Ah, the flying car; that'll do, that'll do. Naturally, they almost crash into the train with the car, and actually do crash into a particularly nasty gigantic tree on the grounds of Hogwarts. Eats cars, you know.\nThat's just the beginning, though. The boys, joined by their friend Hermione, learn that people are being petrified for no discernable reason at Hogwarts. Who's to blame? Is it Snape, the professor with an obvious disdain for Harry? Is it Malfoy, the slicked-back blonde bully? Or is it the newest professor, Gilderoy Lockhart? The early evidence points to Harry, of course, and Hagrid, the Gamekeeper.\nHarry and his pals must follow the sometimes obscure clues to find out who's responsible for this skullduggery. What's worse, the headmaster, Professor Dumbeldore, is under pressure to find the culprit. And for some reason, there's this creepy whispering voice traveling through the halls of Hogwarts that only Harry can hear - and, for some reason, he can now talk to snakes? Does all of this tie in together, somehow?\nWell, of course it does. The appeal isn't the end result, it's the journey. This is about as good as the first Harry Potter movie, full of the same mystical charm, although the kids are growing up a bit (the boys in particular are hitting puberty, what with their deepening voices and all). I haven't read the books, but from what I'm told the movie follows the second book rather closely. \nA real treat for sure is seeing all of the veddy excellent veteran British actors in the cast: Kenneth Branagh,  Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, John Cleese, Robbie Coltrane, Julie Walters, Alan Rickman, Miriam Margolyes, and Richard Griffiths.\nThe Chamber of Secrets is about what you'd expect from a Harry Potter movie; it has style, substance, verve, and audacity. The latter is because the movie dares to be as good as the original, if not better. All too often the sequel to a hit movie tries to rest on the laurels of the first film, not venturing out on its own. While it's evident that Chamber of Secrets is part of a series, it's also an excellent standalone movie.\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is rated PG for \"scary moments\"; in fact, there are some gross ones, as well. Which means your kids'll love it! The movie is 161 minutes long, so stock up on the popcorn."}

As most people are aware, there are three books (The Return of the King is the final in the trilogy). There are scenes in the second book that will appear in the third movie, and vice versa. This is perfectly reasonable, in my opinion, as it would be difficult - and perhaps not nearly as entertaining - to present the movies in exactly the same order as the books.\nThat said, there are some major plot deviations in The Two Towers, scenes and situations that appear in none of the books. If one has read the books, this can be quite disconcerting, as one might be expecting the movie to follow the basic plot of either The Two Towers book or The Return of the King book. If one hasn't read the books (but did see the first film in the trilogy), this might not be so disconcerting - one might not even notice a problem. So this isn't a complaint, exactly, as much as it's an observation.\nThe movie picks up right where the last one left off. Now, I'm going to assume here that people reading this have seen The Fellowship of the Ring. When that movie concluded, the original Fellowship had lost two (Boromir was slain by orcs after attempting to gain The One Ring, and Gandalf fell into the abyss beneath the mines of Moria), and the remaining seven were separated. Frodo, the Ringbearer, and his servant Sam have decided to continue their quest alone and are making their way to Mordor. Their fellow Hobbits Merry and Pippin have been kidnapped by those orcs that had slain Boromir; the orcs are under orders to capture alive any Halfling, since they don't know which one has The One Ring. Aragorn the Ranger, Gimli the Dwarf, and Leglolas the Elf are now tracking the horde of orcs, hoping to rescue Merry and Pippin.\nThe first movie clearly belonged to Frodo, who unlike most of his companions is slight, timid but fun-loving, hardly the hardy adventurer. He alone is entrusted to carry the eminently corrupting Ring to its demise in Mount Doom. But the second movie shifts focus to another character, one who was seen only very briefly in the first movie: Gollum. Gollum has a long history with the Ring, and he's now a complete slave to it. He wants it, his Precious, back in his possession. He joins up with Frodo and Sam to lead them to the Black Gate, the terrible entrance to Mordor itself, home of Sauron, the maker of the Ring (who desperately wants it back). Gollum likes Frodo, but he's plagued by split personalities; one side of him wants to help the Hobbits, the other side wants to kill them and eat them - and regain The Ring. It's interesting to note that Gollum, unlike the other major characters, is completely computer generated. This isn't all that new in and of itself, but it's Gollum's emotional expressions that make you think he's as real as the actors playing Frodo and Sam. In fact, director Jackson had Andy Serkis (who voices Gollum) act in the scenes with Sam and Frodo, then had him digitally removed and replaced with a computer-generated Gollum. The result is much more seamless than your run-of-the-mill computerized character.\nBut the story's not just about Frodo and his quest. Sauron knows the Ring's out there, and that a Halfling has it, but he has other matters to attend to. His goal is to wipe out mankind forever. That might be tough in today's world, but in Middle-Earth man was just gaining a foothold; elves and the like had ruled for eons. Saruman, as seen in the last movie, has been breeding legions and legions of superfighters, mutant orcs called Uruk-hai. The Uruk-hai are sent to attack the kingdom of Rohan, which has already been attacked from the inside through a silver-tongued advisor to the king, a Wormtongue (Brad Dourif). By casting a spell on the king, Theoden, Wormtongue is able to render him invalid; his kingdom is shortly weakened. Wormtongue is working for Saruman, who's working for Sauron (even though he thinks he's working for himself). In addition, the kingdom of Rohan has been set against that of Gondor, the other remaining Man kingdom. Together, they might be trouble for the Enemy; separate, they can be picked apart.\nOne of the most prolonged scenes in the movie is the battle at Helm's Deep. After being removed from his spell, Theoden takes his people there for shelter and safety, determined to fight, aided by Aragorn, Leglolas, and Gimli. The Uruk-hai, some ten thousand strong, attack. There have been many excellently staged epic battle scenes in cinematic history, but they all seem to pale to the extravagance and sheer power of this one. It's an awe-inspiring scene, guaranteed to make one cheer.\nNow, as I said, there are some differences between the books and this movie. I don't mind if certain scenes or sequences are left out, because you can only cram so much into a three-hour movie. But when scenes appear in the movie that never appeared in any of the books, I have a problem. These books have been around for a long time, and it just seems foolhardy to add plot that doesn't need to be added, while at the same time omitting plot that seems necessary. I won't go into details here about what \"new\" scenes are in the movie that aren't in the books, but I was scratching my head after a few of them (and I had just reread The Two Towers a month or so ago).\nThere's even less attention paid to female characters this time around. Arwen, the Elvish beauty who had a thing for Aragorn in the first movie, is seen in dream sequences only - although this is indeed an important plot point, as it explains Aragorn's motivations a bit more lucidly. There's a new female character as well: Eowyn, the daughter of the Rohan king, who (surprise, surprise) also has a thing for Aragorn.\nThere are some funny moments as well, most of them involving Gimli the Dwarf, who appears to be along for comic relief - even more so than in Fellowship. This can, however, have the unintended consequence of marginalizing Gimli's character; after all, he's a strong, steadfast, and tough Dwarf, yet he's pigeonholed into a \"comic\" character. The chemistry between him and Leglolas the Elf is excellent, however.\nOne thing that we must all be thankful for is that the movie does shift away from Frodo himself. Elijah Wood continues to prove he's a terrible actor, incapable of expressing emotion adequately. As the story wears on, Frodo is supposed to get weaker and more beaten - although at times he can rouse himself to complete his quest. But Wood always has that scared look, that deer-caught-in-headlights look, the look that says, \"Why am I here with these actors?\" The performance is flat and ineffectual. And although the focus of the movie as a whole does shift away from Frodo, because his scenes basically involve just him, Sam, and Gollum, Wood's inadequacies are that much more accentuated. Luckily, these scenes are dwarfed (pardon the pun) by the battle scenes.\nIt's never easy to make the middle movie in a trilogy - you want to build on the first movie and lead to the third. Remember Back to the Future II? Wasn't quite as charming as the first one or as action-packed as the third one. It was just kind of there. The Two Towers suffers this indignity, to an extent. Unlike the first one, there's no opening narration that gets everyone up to speed, and like the first one, this one just sort of .... ends. And not necessarily in the same manner as the second book did, either.\n\nThis movie isn't as good as The Fellowsip of the Ring, but it's still very, very good. I'm giving it three-and-a-half stars out of four, but bear in mind it was a tough three and a half to get. It's not as bad as a three-star movie, but it's not quite the masterpiece of the first movie, either."}

At the end of the first movie, Kay neuralizes himself, erasing all memory of his MIB adventures, choosing instead to retire from active duty and leaving Jay to handle those mean ol' aliens all on his own.\nAs MIB II begins, Kay's now a postmaster. Yep, you read that right, a postmaster. In a small town. Wny, he's about as removed from alien adventurin' as one could get. Meanwhile, Jay is BAOC (big agent on campus) in the land of MIB, answering directly to Zed (Rip Torn).\nWhich is all fine and dandy till some oversexed strumpet (Lara Flynn Boyle) from outta space lands on Earth (okay, so she's not really female or human, but rather takes the guise of a model in a victoria's Secret catalog) to find some special light that was supposedly left there back in the day. If she/it finds the light, the planet is doomed. So she takes MIB headquarters hostage. I mean, after all, who wouldn't?

Trouble is, Kay can't remember a darn thing, being neuralized and all. He doesn't even remember being an agent.\n\nCan Jay deneuralize Kay? Can they both save the world? Will Lara Flynn Boyle ham it up as the evil temptress, or will she try to save her career and turn in some decent work? YES! YES! NO!\nThis is truly a popcorn movie, although I forgot to eat popcorn while watching it. It's the kind of movie where you do other things while watching the DVD. You look up every now and then, see alien guts being spilled or hear witty repartee, and then go back to what you're doing. It's not a thinking man's movie; it's more of a slouching man's movie.\nAnd that's just fine. That's what the original movie was, after all. Smith and Jones are excellent and appealing; they have great chemistry onscreen. Think Gibson and Glover in Lethal Weapon, or Dreyfuss and Estevez in Stakeout. Boyle's a good foil, but she's mostly ineffectual. After all, it's the boys' show."}

Kind of like an old sweater that has a few holes in it but still fits okay.\nSpeaking of holes, a James Bond plot is never something that should be examined too closely. One might then discover unfathomable peculiarities; it's best to sit back and enjoy the ride, as they say in my favorite theme parks.\nDie Another Day begins very well - Bond is captured during an operation in Korea. He's been set up, you see. Okay, so that kind of thing happens a lot to these superspies, but this time he's set up and captured and... and tortured! Yes, Bond! No, you don't get loving, lingering looks at Bond being tortured, so it's a quick 14 months in captivity.\nIt's not giving away much at all to let you know that he does escape. This is Bond, after all. It's not likely he'd be kept for the duration of a film.\nBond's stripped of his 007 title, and he sets off to avenge his wrong. His travels take him to Iceland, where he runs into a sinister mastermind who's doing something nefarious that will likely bother the heck out of a lot of people. Bond manages to pick up enough of the baddie's plans to thwart them.\nBut all of that is just an excuse to see the other two big draws in Bond movies: the girls and the gadgets. Halle Berry appears as Jinx/Miss Swift, who may or may not be on Bond's side. Seems she shows up at the same places he does. Oh, and it's lust at first sight. Bond also much somehow seduce the public-relations director for the bad guy. Do you think he's up to the challenge? She's a bit of an ice queen, too - her name is Miss Frost.\nThere's a lot of snarkiness and sly putdowns, and sometimes these get a little tired. Sometimes we get beat over the head with crappy puns. But if you put that aside and instead concentrate on being entertained, you'll be fine. Pierce Brosnan's growing into the role rather well - after all, while he's not Connery, he's also not Dalton. And he's better than Roger Moore and that other guy, the one who played Bond one time only. I'm speaking of George Lazenby, who starred in perhaps the worst Bond film of them all, On Her Majesty's Secret Service.\nIs this a bad movie? Nope. Is it a Bond movie? Yep. Is it a good Bond movie? Sort of. Let's compare this not with other action movies but with other Bond movies. It's better than A View to a Kill and Moonraker, but not as good as From Russia with Love or Goldfinger. It's serviceable Bond, par for the course Brosnan has set for us."}

That's the basic premise behind this horror thriller, one of the few scary movies out there that carries a PG-13 rating. See, there's this videotape, and anyone who watches it gets a phone call as soon as they're done. A voice says, \"You have seven days.\" And seven days later, you're deader than David Caruso's movie career. So what's behind these weird deaths? To find out, the mother of a teenager who apparently watched the tape (along with several other ill-fated friends) asks her sister Rachel (Naomi Watts), a newspaper reporter, to look into the matter. Rachel has a little boy named Aidan (David Dorman, looking a lot like a Culkin brother), who was close to the suddenly deceased teen. Rachel's travails take her to the stereotypical isolated cabin, where the group of teens stayed, and she discovers the tape. And watches it, of course, as I'm sure we all would. Does she also have seven days? Will she die of fright? And what of her cherubic, quiet son? And how about the neo-hippie, Bohemian ex-lover Noah, whose expertise in video production she needs? Rachel and Noah - who also watches the tape, against Rachel's wishes - find out more and more about the tape's origins and especially about the various specific images on the tape. You see, anyone who has taken a film class in college has seen student or arthouse film shorts that are steeped in abstract art. The images on the tape, very evocative and eerily mesmerizing, are all tied in together somehow - but how? What begins as an investigation of a seemingly harmless urban legend spawns a hysterical, desperate search for survival. It'd be one thing if Rachel had just been able to find out who was behind the tape - you know, a kind of \"I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for that snooping reporter\" thing - without actually watching the tape. But she HAS to watch it, and we have to watch along with her. There are some truly disturbing moments on the tape, and there were plenty of people shuddering in the movie theater. The main problem with the movie is that it never makes one think it's real. Sure, movies aren't documentaries, but a movie is much more enjoyable when the audience really feels as if they're in the movie, or at least feels as if the movie could be happening. But The Ring doesn't quite hook its audience; instead, it feels disconnected, as if - surprise! - you're watching a movie. This is not to say that the characters are not endearing or well-developed, because they are. Rachel is an excellent heroine - she's very smart, can think on her own, she's inventive, curious, creative, and adventurous. (She's also gorgeous, but that aspect isn't played up at all, refreshingly.) And Aidan is a wonderful multilayered character - like many things in the movie, Aidan is not always what we see. Is he a just a quiet, smart kid? Does he know about The Ring? Director Gore Verbinski does a great job in setting the mood; what Rachel feels, we do, although we still realize that what's happening is happening on screen only. There's excellent atmosphere, including a creepy scene with a little girl in an insane asylum; it's all very lurid. Watching Rachel piece the mystery together, while racing the clock, is fascinating - but again, it's like watching runners in a marathon on TV. You can see them sweat, and you can see them gasp, but you can't feel the pain they're going through, either physically or mentally.   The pacing of the movie is also above average - truly suspenseful moments are drawn out, and the real terror isn't seen, but imagined. As with The Sixth Sense, the act of building tension in a scene can really make or break a horror/suspense movie. Lesser films show you everything, and that's why they're lesser films.   So what's the bottom line? Is this a movie worth watching? Yes, it is. It's not the full-blown horror classic it wants to be, but it doesn't miss the mark by much. And the scenes on the infamous videotape have to be seen to be believed. It is a movie that'll haunt you for a few days or weeks? Probably not. It has a lot of evocative images, and it's well acted, but it lacks a heart."}
< {"rating": "1", "date": "6 August 2002", "title_id": "tt0286106", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "Stop! Turn around! No entry!", "content": "On one level, Signs is about those weird crop circles that appeared in various places in the 1970s. On another level, it's about faith and how people can find their own faith severely tested.\nBut first, the crop circles. Who made them? Aliens, or humans playing a prank? In the present, the same mysterious circles are appearing throughout the world, including on a farm outside Philadelphia. The owner of this farm is Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), a former priest who renounced his faith when his wife was struck and killed by a driver who fell asleep at the wheel. Graham lives on his farm with his two kids Morgan (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin) and his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), and they all get along right fine until one weird morning when the kids discover that part of their corn crop has been flattened  - in a perfect circle.\nWhat could this mean? Well, it's not giving anything away to explain that the film goes the aliens-are-communicating-with-us route; but as the second layer of the film might indicate, this isn't just about humans versus aliens, it's about having faith that one can weather a storm.\nOlder son Morgan immediately jumps on the it-must-be-aliens bandwagon, and he obtains a book on UFOs at a local bookstore. Soon, wouldn't you know it, he's got his sister and his uncle believing aliens are here, and they're up to no good. Morgan explains that the circles are the aliens' way of making a map, and in due time he and his family are wearing those dopey tin-foil hats that crazy people put on to keep aliens from reading their minds.\nNow, I want you to stop and reread that last part: They put on tin-foil hats so the aliens can't read their minds. Sure, I know what you're probably thinking - this movie's done in a campy, 50's sci-fi kind of way, where nothing seems terribly real, but it's still entertaining. That would have been fine, but that's not how this movie was presented. Every nuance, every step, everything in the movie is presented as deadly serious - even the stupid tin-foil-hat thing. People in the theater laughed when things seemed amusing, but the laughter was misplaced; there wasn't anything terribly humorous in the entire movie.\nFirst, let's look at the characters. Graham is a strong, stoic type, but he dearly misses his wife (her death is needlessly recreated - sure, it had a lot to do with the issue of Graham's faith, but it was still pointless) and probably isn't as good of a parent as he'd like to be. His brother Merrill is a former minor-league baseball player who's a few sandwiches short of a picnic lunch.  Much is made out of Merrill's dopiness (including a scene in which it's revealed why Merrill is not playing major league baseball), but I'm not sure why.\nMorgan and Bo are relatively interchangeable with other child characters. Morgan's a know-it-all, pushy and obnoxious. Oh, but we're supposed to think that has to do with his dad's lack of faith. Or am I looking too much into it? And Bo is just the sort of cutie-pie you'd expect, complete with those gosh-aren't-I-adorable facial and verbal expressions (you've no doubt seen the promos for the movie: \"There's a monster outside my bed, can I have a glass of water?).\nThe characters are poorly developed, and they're not played very appealingly. Yes, I realize Graham is supposed to be a sort of hero with some notable flaws, and these flaws will be exploited at some point during the movie. And perhaps this is a movie about redemption, sure. But was it necessarily good writing to have Graham do bold, heroic things in one moment, and then be utterly clueless and indecisive in the next? And if so much was made of Merrill's slow-wittedness, why wasn't it capitalized on? How come he didn't figure into the overall theme of faith more than he did?\nAnd the kids! In one scene, they're scared; in another, they're almost authoritative. Both characters have less depth than an Etch-a-Sketch doodle. I kept expecting Graham to yell at them - just once - or discipline them in some way, at some point. Nope, never happened. Both actors playing the kids were a bit wooden, too - they couldn't decide whether to deliver their lines in a flat robotic monotone or to overemphasize every other syllable.\nThe pacing was pretty inconsistent, too. There were scenes in the cornfield that were excellently done, typical of an M. Night Shymalan movie (he did The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, too); these scenes evoked real terror and suspense. But there were many scenes that just plain didn't make a whole lot of sense, at least in terms of the rest of the movie. At one point, the family goes into town; almost nothing that happens there is terribly important, and what is important should have taken just a few minutes. Not so. Those scenes dragged on and on and on.\nI haven't even touched on the whole aliens aspect of the plot. Yes, there are aliens, and yes you do see them. Let me introduce Mr. Shymalan to a new concept called special effects. Since you undoubtedly had a budget, perhaps you could have given us more than some dude in a wetsuit. I realize that the alien appearance was secondary to the real theme of the movie, but please - none of that aspect was even remotely believable.\nAs in the worst movies, this film had a high quotient of \"Oh, come on!\" moments. You know, when you're watching a scene and can't help but think, \"Oh, come on!\" These are scenes that test one's credibility, much as Graham's faith was tested. There were contrivances, there were red herrings, and there were serious screenwriting missteps. I lost count at how many times I said, \"Oh, come on!\" during the movie.\nThis must go down as the worst M. Night Shymalan movie, and it also has to be one of the worst that Gibson's done in a long time. He wasn't right for the role, and even he couldn't make much sense of an implausible plot surrounded by nonsequiturs and terrible pacing."}

Austin Powers returns after being an International Man of Mystery and meeting up with The Spy Who Shagged Me. The always hip Mike Myers reprises his tour-de-force role, playing multiple roles, including Austin's archenemy, Dr. Evil; and the loquacious, foul Fat Bastard.\n\nThis time around, Austin's just been knighted by the Queen of England - and his dad (a notorious no-show) isn't there to witness the great event. But no matter, soon Austin's off to stop the nefarious world-domination plot of Dr. Evil. Austin's transported to 1975 in a chic time machine and meets up with Foxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles), a fellow agent. Foxy works for Goldmember, a sinister villain who happens to run a trendy disco club (where Foxy sings, of course). Goldmember's famous for his love of gold; his name stems from the fact that a certain part of his anatomy is golden, owing to a horrible smelting accident.\nAustin and Foxy know that Goldmember has been working on a plan for Dr. Evil, and they're sworn to stop him. That's about all of the plot you need to know now. There are some twists and turns, some absolutely hilarious. Along for the ride are, as in the past films, Seth Green as Scott Evil; Robert Wagner as Number Two, Michael York as Basil, and Verne Troyer as Mini-Me. Adding to the mayhem is Michael Caine with a somewhat smarmy bit as Austin's itinerant dad (although he's a bit under-used; just about any actor could have done the same in this role).\nThe first thing one asks before seeing this film is, \"Will this be as entertaining as the first two films?\" The answer is yes, my friends, yes it is. There are a zillion jokes, and they're largely hit and miss, but those that hit are very funny. One of the misses is actually a hit, too - the opening sequence, which is a movie about Austin Powers - but not starring Austin as Austin, but rather an even more recognizable face, in one of many celebrity cameos.\nAny movie that has you rattling off its catch phrases as you depart the theater is a good movie, in my book. I kept saying, \"Oh, behave!\" even though there was no one else in the car. I even looked over at cars parked next to me at traffic lights, with my eyebrow raised and my mouth widening into a you-know-what grin. Yeah, baby, yeah! Wanna... shag?\n\nGoldmember's a lot of fun. Oh, don't worry, it's not a thinking man's movie. It's gross and disgusting - farts and eating your own skin play into the plot. The jokes can be a little on the ribald side, but there's nothing much you should warn your kids about. For the most part, if your kids loved the first two Austin Powers films, then this one's fine for them to see.\n\nNow, the cast. Myers is excellent as always in his multiple roles - in fact, I think there was more of him on the screen this time around than in the past, but that might have just been my own perception. Knowles, who's basically a novice when it comes to acting (she sings with the group Destiny's Child), is very appealing - spot on, as the Brits would say. \"My name is Foxy Cleopatra, and I'm a whole LOTTA woman!\" she tells Austin when they meet. Foxy's decked out in a big golden Afro wig and platform shoes - boy, who misses the fashion of the 70s, huh? - and peppers her speech with a lot of period slang.\nOnly on celluloid could a guy with bad posture, terrible teeth, no dancing ability to speak of, a somewhat annoying bray, and a crooked haircut get all the hot women. I mean, look at this guy! In the first film, he got Elizabeth Hurley; in the second, it was Heather Graham. And now it's Beyonce Knowles! Who's next? Madonna?\nThere were a couple of slow spots, but not very many. This one was a lot of fun, highly enjoyable."}
< {"rating": "5", "date": "1 July 2002", "title_id": "tt0258463", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "Still-Bourne", "content": "Matt Damon stars as a young man found floating in the middle of the ocean by some French fisherman. He has no memory of who he is, but he does have a weird computer chip implanted in his hip and two bullets in his back. The chip contains a number of an account in Zurich, and there he finds a safety-deposit box with multiple passports, a lot of money, and a gun.\n\nThe young man chooses the identity of Jason Bourne from the box. But who is Jason Bourne? The money and the IDs, along with his supersonic reflexes and hand-to-hand fighting skills, seem to indicate that he's not your typical car salesman. For whom does Bourne work? Is he an assassin? A good guy? A bad guy? And who's following him, anyway? \nBourne hightails it out of Zurich, heading to Paris in the company of Marie (Franka Potente), who accepts his offer of $10,000 to drive him (and another $10,000 when they get there). And of the course of the bulk of the movie, Bourne tries to reconstruct his life - and his identities.\n\nThe movie is based on a Robert Ludlum potboiler thriller, and was made into a TV movie in 1988, with Richard Chamberlain as Jason Bourne. Having not read the book yet, I had no real expectations of the movie. Matt Damon, however, did strike me as a little too young for the role. He's a good actor, and this is a good role for him to work on his acting chops, but he just didn't do it for me in this movie. Damon can be appealing at times, but he's still relatively early in his career, and just not the heavyweight that this role seemed to demand. He seemed very unsure of himself (although, of course, Bourne's very unsure, not knowing who he is or what he's become), veering at times from strong-willed action hero to puzzled milquetoast. \nAs Marie, Potente isn't half bad - she's actually very good, and she gets better as the movie progresses. She's a wanderer without a real home, much like Bourne, and Potente does a fine job of essaying her character's change from someone being forced on a mission to a faithful sidekick, of sorts.\n\nAnother problem is the lack of chemistry between Damon and Potente. The scenes they shared - and there were plenty - should have been sizzling, but they pretty much died in terms of chemistry. Luckily, there was plenty of action surrounding them to make up for this failing. \nThe worst problem, however, was the directing itself. Doug Liman (Swingers) is a pretty good director, but this was his first shot at a spy thriller. Too bad he dropped the ball - the pacing is absolutely leaden throughout much of the film. Either a lot of things were happening - which can be good, as it disguises plot holes - or nothing was happening. If providing a sense of atmosphere was the goal, the film did not succeed. \nThe writing itself was pretty crisp, although the characters were a little flat (and, aside from the two leads, they were caricatures, including Cooper's Machiavellian bad guy). The explosions and car chases were great, but that's become the norm for these films."}
< {"rating": "9", "date": "24 June 2002", "title_id": "tt0181689", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "Nearly flawless Cruise vehicle", "content": "John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the chief of Precrime, a futuristic law-enforcement program that allows authorities to stop murders - before they occur. In a nutshell, three beings called Precogs (short for \"Precognitive\") are able to foresee all killings, usually a day (or less) before they occur. They can identify the killer and the victim, as well as the time of the murder (to the second); it's up to the Precrime team to figure out exactly where the murder will occur based on the Precog visions.\nIt's a system that's never wrong. The Precogs only see crimes that WOULD have happened, not murders that might have happened. In other words, premeditative killings. (Why can't the Precogs see other crimes, such as rapes? Because of, as Anderton put it, \"the nature of murder\"; that is, murder is an act unlike any other crime.)\nAs a result of Precrime's efforts, murder in Washington, DC has diminished rapidly - down by 90%. People don't even think about committing murders anymore; the system is that much of a deterrant.\nWhich makes it ripe for a setup, doesn't it?\nEnter Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell). He's with the Justice Department, on orders from the Attorney General, and he wants to examine Precrime a little more closely. He knows no mistakes are made, but he wants to know why. He's reluctantly given a tour of the facilities by Anderton, and he's even allowed to see the three Precogs.\nShortly thereafter, the red ball that indicates the name of the guilty rolls a familiar name - Anderton himself. The next ball, showing the victim, reveals a name unknown to Anderton himself. He doesn't recognize the name, but he's supposed to kill the man in less than three days.  Needless to say, he runs; needless to say, his Precrim teammates follow.\nThis much you would have gathered from the endless promos for the film. It looks, on the surface, like a standard Tom Cruise they're-out-to-get-me movie. In fact, when I saw previews of this movie, that's exactly what I thought. The man's been set up like a bowling pin in movie after movie.\nBut hold on! It's a lot more complicated than that. Anderton's task is not only to find out the connection between him and the victim but also to find out who would want him to kill the man - and why. It's a trip that takes him through some of his own darkest memories (his son was kidnapped, never to be seen again, as a young boy at a public pool).\nAnderton is not your typical hero figure, either. He's hooked on the new drug of choice, which is consumed in the same way an asthmatic would breathe on an inhaler. He tortures himself nightly by viewing old discs (home movies) of his son and his wife, who left him after the boy's disappearance.\nLuckily, though, it's not a movie that leans heavily on making things up as it goes along, much like Cruise's last opus, Vanilla Sky. It's full of twists, torturous but not murky. Characters from John's past figure prominently into the plotline, but it's up to him to decide how much importance any one person has in resolving his inner and outer conflicts.\nThe movie is also filled with wonderful special effects, the kind that enhance a film, rather than simply detract from its essence. It doesn't depend on these effects to pull it out of illogical missteps, either. Director Steven Spielberg, with this movie, rebounds nicely from the travesty of A.I. to produce what that alternate-reality movie failed miserably to provide: a real, believable plot powered by appealing, plausible characters. The story, based on a Philip K. Dick short story, keeps Anderton on his toes, and the audience along with him. The difference between this movie and many other pretenders is that Minority Report makes the audience care what happens to Anderton at each step of the movie. With many other films, the viewer sort of gives up on the character, either because they can't relate to him or her or because the pacing of the movie is so turgid as to prevent anything but ennui.\nAnd Cruise is perfect in the role. Absolutely perfect. When I saw the preview for this film, I thought the movie was trying to turn Tom into another Arnold-like sci-fi hero (Schwarzenegger's Total Recall was also based on a Dick story). I doubted seriously Cruise's ability to get down and dirty with a role, and pull it off. You may recall he was disfigured in Vanilla Sky; here he goes along a similar route, but his motivations and nuances are perfectly captured. The atmosphere created by the elite cinematography and the dazzling characterization from Cruise himself were the highlights of the movie."}

His father Buck (Peter Boyle) is long retired and a near-invalid, using a walker and leaning on an iron lung. His son Sonny (Heath Ledger) is a novice guard. Hank and Sonny work together on Death Row and are among the guards responsible for the executions (Hank's in charge).\nThe first thing that strikes one about this particular group of men is the level of racism that's apparent in each one. Buck's the worst - he screams at young black kids who happen to wander onto \"his\" property (all three Grotowskis live together) and is liable to spout off some hateful rhetoric at any time. Hank's not a lot better, but his feelings seem tempered in contrast to Buck; he seems more weary than angry. And Sonny is actually friends with that same neighboring black family whose kids come over every now and then.\nThus the line of racism is significantly watered down as the generations progress. This is not to suggest that Sonny is an angel, or that Buck is the absolute devil. Sonny and Hank share the same hooker (though not at the same time); all three men drink, smoke, and cuss like sailors. In short, they're simply not nice folk.\nWhile Hank and Sonny are transporting a prisoner to the electric chair, Sonny takes ill and can't continue.  Because of this, the prisoner (who had bonded a little with the compassionate Sonny earlier) suffers a little during his execution. Enraged, Hank attacks his son in the locker room after the execution, and the other guards have to separate them.\nThat's one relationship being examined - that of Hank and Sonny. The other is the more important one, however. The widow of the executed prisoner, Leticia Musgrove (Halle Berry), is trying to make ends meet as a waitress. But her car constantly dies on her, and after being late to work repeatedly, she's fired - shortly after her husband is executed. She has one overeating kid to feed, too. She does get another job as a waitress, but has to ditch the car when it dies a final time. Walking home in the rain, her son (who has to come with her; can't leave him home to binge) his hit by a car. Hank happens to be passing by, and with some reluctance (remember, he is racist, if not as bad as his father), he stops to help. \nThere's a wonderful dichotomy between the relationship between Leticia and her son and that between Hank and his son. Milo Addica and Will Rokos, who wrote the screenplay, weave a very effective tale that manages to keep all of the characters interesting and relevant. What makes Hank act the way he does? What are Leticia's motivations? And it would be very easy for the actors to portray the characters as nothing more than stereotypes - Hank the nasty, racist white male, and Leticia the vulnerable, victimized African American woman. But both Thornton and Berry rise above their characters' limitations - Hank's not the devil he might think he is, and Leticia isn't the angel that a lesser actress might make her out to be.\nIt's also worth mentioning that each of the two leads has something shocking and powerful happen to them near the beginning of the film, before they really meet. These two events have a huge impact on the characters - you might call the events \"life-altering\". The events allow us to see actual change in the character. Not sudden change, which can be jarring and unrealistic, but gradual, authentic, eminently believable change.\nThe performances by the leads are nothing short of sensational. Berry won the Oscar for Best Actress for her work here. Yes, you read right - Halle Berry. She of The Flintstones, Swordfish, and being married to David Justice fame. See, this is what happens when you give a good actress a great role. The best actresses will rise to the level of the role; the mediocre actresses will sink below it, collapsing under its weight.\nThornton has a tendency to pick offbeat, idiosyncratic roles, albeit usually with a Southern twist. His Hank is not a carbon copy of your stereotypical Dirty White Boy; he's a multilayered character with charm and evil mixed in. The film doesn't make him out to be a complete hero; just a flawed one. By the movie's end, he has come to grips (a little) with his failures and his shortcomings.\nBerry and Thornton have a great supporting cast in Boyle and Ledger. When you think of a hateful, misanthropic, misogynistic demon, you don't think of Peter Boyle, who's turning in great comedic work on the TV show \"Everybody Loves Raymond\". But after this movie, you sure do. Great job. And Ledger - well, I know him best from The Patriot, as Mel Gibson's oldest son. In that movie, he was tough, but he was still a boy in a world of adults. That boy's grown up, and Ledger proves his mettle as an actor in this role.\nThere will be some who find this movie too slow; granted, if you're looking for action, this won't appeal to you. But it's an excellent story, and not as simplistic as it may seem on the outside. It's very well written (meaning that there are few plot holes), and ably directed. You may be fascinated, as I was, with the character development from beginning to end. Things are not - pardon the expression - treated as black-and-white issues; there are varying grays that are resolved and not resolved by movie's end."}

But has he?\nTwo years earlier, John's wife died from injuries sustained in a car wreck, and before she died, in an apparent delirium, she had been etching weird drawings. Could her drawings have some connection with this town?\nBased on true events, The Mothman Prophecies follows John through his search for the truth. People in the town report seeing a strange being - are they lying, or are they misinterpreting? Are they simply seeing UFOs, or is there more to the story? Intrepid reporter that he is, John wants to know more - although of course his thirst for knowledge is accompanied by a need to know what happened to his wife (why did the car crash?).\nThrillers such as this one are hard to come by. It's not exactly a horror movie, but there are more than enough creepy moments to send a few chills reverberating through your body. It's a film that relies less on special effects than on such quaint ideals as character motivation and development and atmosphere. In fact, this movie's just brimming with atmosphere. We've all seen those cheesy movies in which a car runs out of gas along a desolate country road, and then BAM - some serial killers make dinner or belts out of the hapless occupants. But in this case, the monster is hardly ever seen, thereby heightening the scares.\nAt the centerpiece is Gere as Klein. I've never, ever been a Gere fan; it seems to me he has one expression. He's never been terribly emotive and has been known in recent years more for the age disparity with his female costars than for anything else (they get younger, he stays the same old dude). Call him ruggedly handsome if you will, but vacuity is never really appealing.\nBut this is not your typical Gere at all. He definitely turns in the best work of his career. Sure, he was appealing in Pretty Woman, but it was Julie Roberts' movie. Officer and a Gentleman? Ok, but that was Lou Gosset Jr.'s movie. Primal Fear? Red Corner? Runaway Bride? No, no, no. This is acting on a ledge for Gere. It's a true departure from the romantic comedies and the sly psuedo-mystery/dramas. Ordinarily, I would think such a movie would expose Gere for the terrible actor he is. But I would be wrong. This movie was so well written and directed that Gere rose to its level, rather than sinking it. That's a huge credit to him as an actor.\nNow, I need to differentiate between good acting and appeal. An actor can look good or be charming in a role and still be a bad actor; by contrast, an actor can look uncharming and turn in a great performance. But what's key is how the actor draws the audience in - do they sympathize with his plight? Are they on his side? How good of an actor he is will answer that question.\nGere's Klein starts out as an average joe, and then we get to see him slowly descend into madness - we even descend a little with him. That vaunted atmosphere is so vibrant and realistic that we turn when he turns and feel things he feels. This is an absolute hallmark of excellent filmmaking (by Mark Pellington, whose only other big film was 1999's Arlington Road). The writing is crisp and eminently believable, and the acting in addition to Gere (including Laura Linney, Debra Messing, and Will Patton) is simply superb. And don't forget the prophecies part of the title, either; this \"Mothman\" entity issues warnings to whomever it deems worthy. Which sounds good, as long as one can interpret them correctly. Apparently, many have not.\nThe story is based on actual events that took place in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, but this is no Amityville Horror story. With Amityville, one could distance oneself from the experiences of the family involved; we could say that it would never happen to us, it was only a movie. This is a little trickier with The Mothman Prophecies. It's a creepy, tingly movie that gets under your skin and crawls all over your heart."}

While chasing a possible suspect, however, Dormer accidentally shoots his partner, with whom he had had a recent argument, in a dense fog.  Rather than admit his own guilt, though, Dormer tries a coverup, thinking that no one could know what really happened. But someone did see - the man Dormer and his partner were chasing.\nWhat follows is a taut cat-and-mouse game. Walter Finch (Robin Williams) knows what really happened in the murky fog, and he'd like to help Dormer cover it all up - but for a price. And in addition, the shooting of Dormer's partner is also being investigated, separately, by a novice detective named Ellie (Hillary Swank), who idolizes the veteran cop. Something's got to give - Ellie's a great young mind, and it'll only be a matter of time before she figures it out, right?\nEvery movie, save for the mindless, faceless action films, must have some kind of hook for the audience, something to make it unique. In this case, it's the fact that Williams is playing a bad guy - an atypical role. And it's a great role for him, too, as he does a fine job getting to the meat of the character. Pacino's got a good character to play as well - think Serpico - and he's at his best while underplaying thinking man's roles (okay, I'm not forgetting his younger, wilder days as Michael Corleone, but his best work as a pure actor are with these roles). Add in the beautiful Alaska scenery and the fact that it's light out for much, much longer periods than it is for those of us in the continental U.S., and you have quite the setting for a modern film noir, so to speak.\nThe title comes from the fact that Dormer simply can't sleep after he's accidentally (or was it an accident?) shot his partner. He's haunted by images of his dying partner; racked with self-doubt, he also has trouble sleeping because of the endless light in Alaska, resorting to taping his shades closed and placing objects in front of the window to make it darker. And because of his inability to sleep, he becomes very strung out, unable to think clearly.\nThis movie is from the director of Memento, which was a fascinating film noir in its own right, expertly written and directed. Because Memento was so good, I did have higher hopes for Insomnia. Insomnia isn't nearly as good as Memento, but it's still a very well done, intriguing psychological thriller with an excellent cast."}

He lives with his aunt and uncle and rotund, snotty cousin, who thoroughly despise him and make him live in a cupboard below a staircase. And all looks quite lost until the day Harry receives an invitation to attend the prestigious Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and he's carried away by the giant Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane).\nHarry quickly learns that his mom and dad were a witch and wizard, respectively, and that they died while protecting him from the superevil Voldemort (also known as He Who Must Not Be Named); but Harry also learns that there's something about him that protects him from Voldemort. With his trusted new friends Ron and Hermione, Harry must find out what's in the trap door at Hogwarts that's guarded by a three-headed dog named Fluffy - and that certain bad guy or guys wants to get a hold of. \nAs serious as the plot seems, this is a most fanciful movie. It's quick paced, so as not to let the little kippers fall asleep, and is full of all of the dazzling effects you'd expect from a wizards and witches movie. It has quite a few things going for it (it did make a zillion dollars, so it must have something going for it), including a brisk, crisp script that's pretty close to the book, excellent performances from top to bottom, and those omnipresent effects that by now are fairly workaday to most of us.\n\nAuthor J. K. Rowling insisted that all of the cast - or at least those with speaking roles - be British, and as a result we get some of England's finest: Richard Harris (who's actually Irish), John Hurt, Maggie Smith, Ian Hunt, John Cleese, Richard Griffith, Julie Walters, Coltrane, and Alan Rickman. It's a magnificent roster, and each actor appears to be having a great time playing dress-up and spouting some downright hilarious lines.\nThis is a popcorn movie. Is it a date movie? Um, no. Your date might think you're an idiot if you sit down to watch this. But it IS a great movie to watch with your kids, and you might even get them to read the books. And hey, anything that gets kids to read something thicker than a pamphlet is usually a good thing. \nPlus the special effects merely enhance the show; they aren't the show itself. The real star is the precocious Radcliffe (who's been signed to a few more Potter films, by the way) , who essays the young magician perfectly. Too often kids come off as snotty or impossibly cute in movies; Radcliffe is neither, and neither, by extension, is Harry Potter. I've seen too many films in which the kids are nothing more than glorified brats, even when they're the heroes - but not our fair Mr. Potter, who saves the day through his courage, wits, and intelligence. Oh yes, and love."}

Well, look what we get. A convoluted, disinterested absurd piece of pablum that's not worth the celluloid on which it was filmed.\nVanilla Sky is about a dashing young publisher named David Aames (Tom Cruise) who has two women in his life - his \"buddy\" Julie (Cameron Diaz) and mysterious new woman Sofia (Penelope Cruz), who just happens to be his best friend's girlfriend. David feels he's being stalked by Julie, who wants more than sex, but he can't keep his eyes and hands off Sofia. You can see this is just heading for trouble.\nMuch of the plot centers around a violent car crash in which David emerges with a disfigured face. What happens after that is quite surreal - kind of like floating in a dream in which at once everything and nothing seems to have meaning. Under such circumstances, one can twist logic and reality into whatever one desires (in this case, \"one\" would be the screenwriter). Anything can happen and be justified. That's great, but it doesn't always make for a good movie, just as free association doesn't make for a good novel.\nTo begin with, Cruise himself seems miscast, although ironically so. He's the kind of movie actor who much of the world sees as the cocky, arrogant, preening archetype of male stars, always worried about how they look. And yet here he is with a horribly ugly face - is he trying to tell the world, \"Look, I can play creepy-looking, too!\" No, Tom, you can't.\nAnd for at least the third movie, I hear Cruise utter these words, or a variation: \"I've been set up!\" He sure gets set up a lot - see The Firm, this one, and the upcoming Minority Report, to name three. What it all goes back to is his characters' inability to believe they themselves have done anything wrong, ever.\nSecondly, there's a huge lack of chemistry between any of the three leads, especially between Cruise and Cruz. I'm sure there are legions of people who believe Penelope Cruz is the cat's pajamas, but don't count me among them. I didn't find her particularly attractive or alluring in the movie. I won't waste space picking apart her obvious physical issues, but please - let's not place her on some goddess pedestal. But for a couple that apparently fell for each other off the set, Cruise and Cruz don't seem particularly enamored of each other on it. Yes, they make goo-goo eyes to each other. Snoresville.\nAnd that plot! It's one thing to have twists and turns, each leading to more questions and mysteries, and it's quite another to have each twist cancel out the last twist. The movie kept negating itself. I know it was trying to show that the line between dreams and reality can be seriously blurred, but you can't have each scene render the last one irrelevant. Instead of being clever, all this does is confuse and frustrate the viewer.\nAbout the only real spark of life comes from David's best friend Brian, played by Jason Lee. And you know, when Jason Lee's the only one making things happen, you know you got yourself a crappy movie. There are supposed heavyweights in this movie - Cruise, Diaz - and your best performance is by Jason Lee of Mallrats and Almost Famous (another Cameron Crowe movie, like this flop)? Geez!\nI'm glad I didn't see this in the theater, although I might not have been so critical if I had (you know, it's the classic \"I spent $8 on this, so I'm gonna like it!\" rhetoric). I don't think Cruise's career is in any kind of jeopardy, as evidenced by his usual $20 million paycheck. He might want to develop an additional facial expression or two, however.\nThis is a bizarre, pointless movie that seems to take delight in its tortured script, wallowing in its own nonsense."}

What peril over yon hill awaits these merry travelers?\nManny is the linchpin of the trio. He's a lone mammoth, staying put when all others of his kind (as well as of any other kind) begin their yearly migration to a more arid climate. Manny is morose and a little bitter, but this is quickly recognized as a facade for a warmhearted mammal. He initially wants to stay a lone mammoth, but he's soon joined by the ever-jabbering Sid, who's a little short on both brain and brawn power. When a baby human is left behind by his dying mother, Sid convinces the immovable Manny to help transport the tyke back to his family.\nThe two are joined by Diego, a saber-tooth tiger who was in on the attack on the family and tribe of the young human. Diego's been ordered to retrieve the baby by the head tiger, who wants to do all sorts of nasty and unspeakable things to the infant. Diego's plan is to ingratiate himself with Sid and Manny, offering to take them to the area where they can meet up with the human tribe. Which is fine with Manny, who just wants to be rid of the kid - and Sid.\nIce Age, then, is a good old-fashioned buddy pic. The three disparate animals, each outcast in very subtle ways, form a bond that has a common goal. Along the way, they face dangers more of the nature type than of the predator type, and each saves and is saved. But this isn't a movie about great moral lessons; it's a damn hilarious laugh-a-minute cartoon. It's aimed at kids, of course, although the style of animation (it looks a little closer to Toy Story than, say, Looney Toons) can be appreciated by adults, too. \nBut what makes this such a cool movie is that the writing and the timing of the humor - and it's heavy into physical comedy - are impeccable. Sure, it's easier to do this with animation than with live action, but any movie at which I can laugh out loud, unprompted, at a near-constant rate is a surefire winner. Of course, at this point most kids have seen this - pardon me for being one of the last - but if you can still spot it in the theater, please do go."}

The fear of the unknown, conventional wisdom holds, is the ultimate fear. We do not fear the dark because it is dark; we fear it because of what it masks.\nThe Others harkens back to those oldtime scary movies, a haunted house movie that answers some questions, invites many more, and always keeps you on the very cusp of collapsing into hysterics. It's not just a neat ghost story told well; it's practically dripping with atmosphere.\nGrace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) lives in a gigantic old mansion with her two young children, Anne and Nicholas, waiting for her husband to return from World War II. The kids have developed a sort of photosensitivity disease, and cannot be exposed to any light more than that of a candlelight. This leads to the house being shrouded in darkness much of the time, and Grace even goes so far as to direct that no door may be opened without the previous door being closed, so as to prevent extra light from shining on the children.\nGrace hires a troika of housekeepers and handyman to help around the house and with the kids, but the three older people seem... well, a little off to her. And soon the Stewarts come to believe they are not at all alone in the expansive manse, as daughter Anne insists she has seen and spoken to a little boy named Victor.\nWho's behind the spectre appearances? Is it the hired help? Are the kids fibbing to their stern mother? Or is it all in the mind of Grace herself? Adding to the confusion is the return of Mr. Stewart to the house - like the help, he seems more than a little bit off-center. What is going on?\nThe mood is positively eerie, and it's accomplished by a pronounced lack of musical accompaniment. In most horror movies, one hears a melodramatic chord or two, leading up to the victim being slaughtered. Not in The Others. Silence is deadly and heightens the tension and suspense immeasurably.\n\nThis is probably Kidman's finest work, and in my mind it mostly erases the painful memory of watching her attempt to act in Eyes Wide Shut. Stripped of the baggage known as Tom Cruise, Kidman is simply superb, mesmerizing the viewer to the point of feeling a deep empathy for her plight. The plot's no slouch, either, full of twists, including an incredible denouement. As ghost stories go, The Others is one of the best I've ever seen."}

From Limbo", "content": "A clarvoyant inspector works on the famed Jack the Ripper murder cases in Victorian era London. Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp) can best be described as troubled, as he is haunted both by his own psychic abilities and his dependence on absinthe. As destitute prostitutes are murdered and eviscerated, disemboweled, and worse on the streets of the extremely poor Whitechapel section of the city, Abberline tries to discern the culprit - it's a learned man, he concludes, one with a distinct knowledge of medicine. Smart lad, that. \nAs Abberline becomes more and more involved with the case, he also becomes more involved with one prostitute in particular whose group seems to have been targeted, Mary Kelly (Heather Graham). From the start, one can tell that Mary and Abberline will hook up, because she is the only prostitute who does not look downtrodden and, well, like a bucket of mud. (As a point of fact, love interests never look like buckets of mud, unless the story is about a cure for looking like a bucket of mud, or something.)\n\nAt any rate, as Abberline investigates further, he runs into his ultraconservative, image-conscious boss, who even asks him to destroy evidence and suspends him (how come so few police chiefs and the like actually act in concert with their detectives and officers on the screen? How come the cop has to go beyond regulations to get at the truth?). Abberline does have the help of his colleague Peter Godley (the always-reliable Robbie Coltrane), but in general he's on his own. Can he solve the crimes?\nDepp attempts to disappear into the role, and for the most part he succeeds, right down to what sounds to me like an authentic Cockney accent (but what do I know?). The problem is, the story's weak, and when the lead actor's just trying to blend in, the movie comes off as rather pedestrian. In other words, folks, you've already seen this movie in one form or another. There are some twists, but they're minor ones. It's a rainy, cold, dark, dreary movie, much like I imagine London itself was back then (and perhaps still is, at times). There's simply not much unique with this movie, and it could have been just as well done with lesser-known stars. Graham, in particular, is wasted here - she's a fine actress, but she's left to do little more than be a victim.  In addition, the ending is pretty unsatisfying, although the killer is named."}
< {"rating": "8", "date": "20 May 2002", "title_id": "tt0121765", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "A satisfying mixed bag", "content": "Most of you who have even thought about watching this movie have seen some comments by critics. While it is a good idea to judge movies by your own standards, sometimes you can avoid stinkers by listening to what the critics specifically dislike and like. And, of course, if their dislikes are similar to yours, you can follow their lead.\nHere are comments from some critics, followed by my own assessment:\n1. The acting is horrible.\nThis is true, somewhat. Of all of the lead actors, only Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi) is at least passable; Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker) and Natalie Portman (Senator Padme Amidala) are both pretty awful. McGregor seems to be playing Alec Guinness (who, of course, originated the role in 1977's Star Wars), and this has been perceived as a knock on him. Personally, I think it was the wise way to go. We all know that Obi-Wan dies in Star Wars (Episode IV), so what McGregor was trying to do was kind of morph into Guinness, to make it easier for us to take the transformation from McGregor in the upcoming Episode III to Guinness in Episode IV.\n\nChristensen, at first glance, seems woefully miscast and overmatched. One of the knocks on him is that he just comes off as your typical teenager (in the movie, he's 15). The critics sometimes fail to remember that Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker in Star Wars was just as petulant and moody, so this is more of a character issue than an actor issue. However, Christensen's line readings are atrocious, and some of the writing of his character is banal. In one scene, for example, he rails against Obi-Wan to Senator Amidala - how he's underappreciated by Obi-Wan, how he doesn't get to do nuffin, and so on. Real fascinating stuff - not. And the scene drags on a bit too long, making the character move from gritty angst to just plain obnoxiousness. Of course, bear in mind that Anakin does grow up to be the evil Darth Vader, and the lad's fits of pique are George Lucas's way of showing us how he's already struggling with the Dark Side of the Force.\nPortman was excellent in Episode 1, but she's completely flat in this one. Sometimes people unfairly compare her character to Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). Fisher brought spice to the character, whereas Portman brings a more regal attitude. Yes, she's a can-do Senator (formerly Queen, don't ask how). Bringing different things to the table is fine, but again - remember that Amidala will be Leia's mother, so some of the virtues found in Leia should appear, you would think, in Amidala (and in Anakin). In addition, the chemistry between Christensen and Portman is completely nonexistent. You'd find more sexual vibes between a nun and a eunuch. This is definitely the result of bad casting - your lovers HAVE to appear to love each other, and they were very unconvincing. I could see the audience wincing each time Anakin and Amidala began to talk in that low voice that's supposed to essay passion. Snore!\nSamuel L. Jackson, who plays Jedi Master Mace Windu, gets a much larger role here than he had in Episode I, and he even gets to kick ass, himself. Great to see Sam wielding a purple lightsaber! One of his generation's greatest actors - and is anyone saying he's slumming? Hell, no. Was Alec Guinness slumming? Or Peter Cushing? Or the indomitable Christopher Lee (interesting note: in the past several months, Lee has appeared in two of the highest-grossing films, both epics, Attack of the Clones and Lord of the Rings, playing characters that are disturbingly similar)? Sam Jackson rocks. He just plain rocks.\n2. It's poorly written.\nI can't agree with this assessment - I thought it was pretty well written. One benefit to seeing the first trilogy after the second is that we can see origins more clearly: If X happens in Episode II, we know that explains Y in Episode IV. I liked a lot of the little details - the beginnings of Boba Fett, for example. And if you look hard, you'll see Greedo from the first Star Wars in there, too.\n3. It's FX-driven.\nIt sure is, and I'm glad it was. Now, when Star Wars came out, everyone was all agog over the effects, because there had never been anything like it before, and the movie showed a long-distant vision of the future. But here in 2003, we've seen a lot of space movies and a lot of not-so-special effects. The novelty's worn off a little, and we're not as enthralled. But don't get me wrong, the effects in this movie are excellent; they're just not unique anymore. (Still, as one critic noted, the ship that's bringing Amidala to the conference sounds like it's running on propellers... what's up with that??)\nOf course, in lieu of a million space fights, we get a lot of lightsaber-play. If you remember your Jedi history, all of the Jedi were wiped out during the Clone Wars (Obi-Wan explains this to Luke in Star Wars). This movie leads right up to those wars, and many of the Jedi in this movie don't make it through to the end. But man, while they're around - lots of great fights. In fact, the greatest Jedi of them all, Yoda, gets to kick ass, something that could never be done in 1977, or 1980, or 1983. In fact, the scene pitting Yoda against the evil Count Dooka (Christopher Lee) is magnificent, almost worth the admission on its own.\nAt any rate, although the movie is loaded with effects, that's not the only reason we're watching. The truth is, many of us have bought into the mythos of Star Wars, and dammit, we care about these characters. And I think our curiosity about some things was satisfied by this movie.\n\nOne of the best indicators of a movie's quality is the feeling one gets as the movie concludes. Do you feel happy or satisfied? Good. Frustrated? Bad. Looking for more? Great. And that's where Attack of the Clones, despite its Grade-Z subtitle, succeeds magnificently. You want very much to find out what happens to the gang in Episode III. A movie can enjoy no higher praise than to leave its audience wanting more."}

I don't care if that one room's outfitted like Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants; if you limit your setting, you're asking for yawns. But that's what Panic Room does. Sure, there's a lot of action - such as it is - outside the room - but even what isn't contained within the ultrathick walls of the safe place is contained within the relatively small house itself (or maybe just the ultrathick walls of the screenwriter's mind).\nThe gist of the story is that Meg Altman (Jodie Foster), who's recently been divorced from her husband, a very wealthy pharmaceutical dude, is buying this upscale brownstone in Manhattan for her and her generic kid (although not a cute generic kid; looks like they ran out of \"cute\" at Child Actors R Us and had to settle for not-so-cute-but-oh-so-spunky). Even though the fee is more than she's willing to pay and even though it's a little weird looking, our plucky heroine throws caution to the wind and buys the place. And immediately moves in - which, you homeowners know, happens with all the frequency of a loan getting approved quickly.\nThe place has this complicated security system - it doesn't look all that large, frankly, but the system separates the house into zones, all \"armed\" at night. Sounds safe, right? When the house was being shown to Meg, she noticed that the master bedroom was smaller than it should be - surprise! There's a hidden room! Oh, what fun! What's it for, you ask? It's explained to Meg that if someone breaks into the house, she can get to the room and call the police from the handy-dandy not-connected-to-the-main-line phone; even if the main line's cut, you see, she can still call Officer Bob.\n\nNow, I don't know about you folks, if, while being shown a new place, I am told that the house has an awesome \"safe room\" in case someone breaks in - I'm getting the hell out of there. Wouldn't that tell even the biggest dunce that there's a crime problem in the area? I mean look - there's a friggin' security system! They're saying that a) people will break in, b) the security system won't do squat, c) you can't call the cops from the main line because they'll show up next week, so yay! We have this neato safe room for you.\nSo to begin with, the premise is mired in utter stupidity. In fact, I sit here dumbfounded by its stupidity.\nNaturally, the first night Meg and her daughter Sarah are sleeping in the house, someone breaks in. Three burglars are there to recover something from the panic room's vault, but of course they don't expect anyone to be in the house. Okay, common mistake. One of them, Burnham (Forrest Whitaker), almost decides to call off the thing, since people are in there and he's got this thing against hurting people, and all that. But don't worry, he's soon talked out of it by Junior (Jared Leto), the nominal head of this happy bunch, which also includes the unexpected Raoul (Dwight Yoakam - didn't he used to have a music career, or something?).\nWhoosh! Meg and the youngster rush to the panic room, where they proceed to panic.\nA lot of contrivances abound. For one thing, Meg's claustrophobic, so she has problems dealing. For another, Sarah is diabetic, a fact that plays an unfortunate major role in the movie. Can Meg save her child before the bad guys get to her? Oh, can she?\nYou know, just as an aside, I remember when Forrest Whitaker was just starting out in show biz. Remember Good Morning, Vietnam? That boy made some great career moves - Smoke was another. He's a great supporting-role kinda guy. It's just a crying shame this movie depends on him so heavily. He's the only one - yes, only one - who turns in even a decent performance. And since he's a bad guy, I should have been rooting against him, right? Ha! Guess again, Dr. Watson. I was hoping Burnham would escape.\nJodie Foster, on the other hand, gives one of the most constipated performances of a lifetime. Did she check out her contract before agreeing to this crap? This woman's won OSCARS, for crying out loud! Geez, they couldn't get Ann Archer to do this role? Or Christine Lahti? Or Kathleen Turner? Or anyone else whose career has slowed down a bit?\nEleven people, including me, were in the theater when I watched this movie. Eleven! It's a new movie, too! And because there were 11, I tried my darndest not to laugh out loud at the moronic dialog, inept direction, and incompetent camerawork. Really. I tried hard. But failed. I mean, I didn't want to embarrass myself, much as the actors onscreen were embarrassing themselves.\nOh, and to add more insult to the whole shebang, the director is the same guy who brought the creative Fight Club and Seven to the big screen. Talk about slumming!\nThis turkey is rated unwatchable. The movie was somehow allowed to rise from somewhere in the murky bowels of Mother Earth to fester like a cold sore in the mouth of the American audience."}

His house is away from everything else - not a neighbor for miles, the lawyer tells them all - lending a supposedly eerie atmosphere to the murky, muddled script.\nArthur is joined by his lovely daughter Kathy (Shannon Elizabeth - you might remember her from being scantily clad in the American Pie movies), his morbid young son Bobby (Alec Roberts), and his son's nanny Maggie (Rah Digga). The mother died in a fire, a fact that's brought up more than once throughout the movie. It's all about ghosts, you see, just in case you were misled by the film's title. Ghosts and souls and fun, uplifting stuff like that.\nAt any rate, the family gets this house, but weird things happen even before Arthur signs the paperwork. For one thing, there's the wacky dude named Rafkin (Matthew Lillard) who palled around with ol' Uncle Cyrus (played by F. Murray Abraham - remember when he won an Oscar for Amadeus? Poor guy can't catch a break now, generally playing heavies, but this is a new low for his career). Seems Rafkin knows more than a little about these weird goings on. So what's it all about? There are thirteen ghosts, collected there by Uncle Cyrus, and there's also a whole buncha money, safely stowed inside a whole horkin' ton of traps.\nBut Arthur and his clan just want to get out of the house, which sealed itself shut as soon as possible. The ghosts don't want them to leave, y'see, because they're basically ghosts of Really Bad People (oh, and they can only be seen through use of these nifty special glasses). Naturally, the kids get lost, separated from their dad who must, with the dubious help of Rafkin, somehow locate them before they're tortured and killed by the spirits.\nThis movie is about 95% screams - and no, that's not a good thing, no matter how enamored you are of slasher films. The plot is simplistic and is largely unnecessary, given the massive budget for effects (I'm reluctant to call them 'special'). There's much shrieking, probably so designed to distract the viewer from the unending, undying crappiness of the film itself. Forget the acting - there is none. These people take every cliche from the Great Book of Horror Movies and overact their way to stupendous boredom. It's a lesson in ennui, which is tough when you're trying to make a horror movie. One fun pasttime for those watching the movie is to see how dumb and gullible the characters are. This is a time-honored tradition; ever sit down and watch a cheesy 70s horror movie, pointing out the utter stupidity of the Dumb Blonde who comes back to the cabin to find none of her friends around, then proceeds to take a shower - with the bathroom door open? Sure, we've all done that. That's about all you can do with this waste of time, too. In the grand pantheon of horror movies, it's pretty awful, albeit slightly better than that benchmark of Crappidom, Blair Witch Project II: Book of Shadows."}

That in itself is an unusual sentence - not the Oscar part, but the \"corrupt\" part, as Washington rarely plays bad guys. But his Alonzo is most certainly a bad guy, out on the streets not for the greater good but to further his own interests. Even so, while Alonzo's not the most moral of characters, Washington makes him so multilayered that you almost root for him to persevere. Ethan Hawke plays rookie cop Jake Hoyt. Ok, he's not a rookie cop, exactly; he's been on the force for something like 14 months. But he wants to do bigger and better things, so he's signed up for Alonzo's elite narc squad.\n\nAlonzo puts Hoyt through the paces - visiting snitches, shaking down people, doing the drugs they confiscate (or at least making Hoyt do them). Through it all, Alonzo seems mean and cynical, but also worldly and supremely intelligent. He's not just some megalomaniacal renegade cop who's king of his own world, or even some Johnny Law with a 'tude. The viewer wonders what's up Alonzo's sleeve: Does he have plans for young Mr. Hoyt? Is he just playing with him? Or is he just completely nuts? You just plain never can tell with Washington's portrayal, and that's why he deserved the Oscar. Always keeping the audience guessing, Washington makes sure you don't pigeonhole his character as purely evil. \nThe events that take place during the day (as the title suggests, all of the action is confined to one day's work) imply that they're all leading up to something - the audience just doesn't know what. If Alonzo is bad and is looking out for himself, what kind of denouement can be expected? If he isn't completely bad, is he going to say the day's just been one long lesson for his newcomer? \nThe crisp script by David Ayer never lets up, relentlessly pounding the viewer with these and other questions. Moral ambiguity is a delicious plot device, but only if the script is well written. There's hardly any lag in Training Day, so that if there were any plotholes the viewer would gloss over them quickly enough. The movie's hard hitting, full of life and excitement, complete with plenty of twists. You can never get completely used to anything in the movie, because few things are as they seem.\nThe one exception to this is Hoyt himself. Maybe he's supposed to be an Everyman; more likely he's just a wide-eyed innocent being corrupted by the Big Bad Veteran. Hawke has the wide-eyed look down pretty good, which is a bit of a comedown from a guy who played a supercool dude in 1994's Reality Bites. It's the meatiest role Hawke's had, and he seriously flubs it. But since he's playing opposite Washington, and since this is Washington's movie, Hawke's inadequacies are easily overlooked, as well they should be. Having said that, there's no way Hawke should have been nominated for an Oscar, as he was. What were people thinking? That Washington was as good as he was because he had Hawke to play off? Hardly. It's an ineffectual performance; Edward Norton would have been a far better choice - and he could have walked home with that Oscar, too."}

The basic plotline for his breakthrough hit Clerks was a lot like this short play I wrote in the late eighties. No, he didn't steal it from me (although we're both Jersey boys!), but still they were eerily similar. Oh, and he's a huge movie buff, too - check out all of his in-jokes and clever casting. There's a decided New Jersey edge to his movies, which is always cool.\nThe characters of Jay and Silent Bob have appeared in each of Smith's movies, played by Jason Mewes and Smith himself. They're great characters, because while the plots of the movies change, they don't. And they're well characterized, too; even though Jay's coarse language would put a longshoreman to shame, he's caustically funny, obscene but hilarious. And Bob - well, he's silent, except for one soliloquy in each movie. He's the conscience of the picture, y'see. And Smith's perfect for his own role.\nSo finally the two get their own movie, begging the question: Are the characters strong enough to warrant their own film? Could they carry it?\n\nAnswer: Hell, yeah.\nJay and Silent Bob, who have been barred via restraining order from hanging out in front of the convenience store in Clerks, find out that a comic book based on them is being made into a movie. Now, you and I might want a piece of that movie pie, but Jay and Silent Bob are more concerned with the plethora of insults being hurled at them on the Internet, mainly by overactive teenagers. So they set off on a cross-country crusade to stop the film at all costs.\nActors who have appeared in previous Smith films, including Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, George Carlin, Joey Lauren Adams, Brian O'Halloran, and Jeff Anderson have roles in this one - in fact, Affleck and Damon play themselves (Affleck has two roles). Other stars, like Carrie Fisher, Judd Nelson, Mark Hamill, and Will Ferrell, have small roles as well. It's a fast-paced road movie, as the duo run into myriad characters, including the gang from Scooby Doo and a band of female jewel thieves. \nSmith tosses everything in here he could think of, although there's probably more on the cutting room floor that didn't make it. As I said, there are plenty of inside jokes that reference previous Smith films and parody countless other Hollywood movies (Star Wars, The Fugitive).\nHaving watched all of Kevin Smith's movies (and being from New Jersey, which doesn't hurt in this case), I hardly ever stopped laughing during this entire film! I thought it was a stitch, a laugh riot. It was a lot better than it deserved to be."}

The old gang he ran with back in the day wants him to pull off another job, so they send Don Logan (Ben Kingsley) from London to encourage the relaxed former bad guy. But Gal's out of the game, y'see, and he says no. Repeatedly. Retired, he says. Done, he says. Trying to go legit, he says. Don't they always try to go legit? And then the Big Boys want them to pull of One Last Heist, or some such nonsense? And so the old fart straps on his hoodlum scowl and gets to work. They never stay straight, these guys.\n\nSo much of the dialog in this movie is utterly incomprehensible, at least if you're not from England. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but don't the British speak English? The Cockney dialects are unintelligible, at least at the beginning. I suspect that once you get used to the accents, you can pick up at least some of the words, but for my money this is a movie that should have had extensive subtitles. As a point of reference, in Snatch (2001), Brad Pitt's character was an Irish gypsy who spoke a completely unrecognizable dialect - it was so muddled that even the other characters had no idea what he was saying! This movie's a lot like that, only the joke's on the audience, not the characters.\nIt's violent, and it does have its twists, which are both usually good points in a movie of this genre. The movie received quite a bit of acclaim when it came out in the theaters because of Kingsley's performance (this ain't Ghandi, a role he perfected with an Oscar in 1982); however, I don't see his work as fine acting - I see it as overacting. He's hammy, not nuanced. People see a lot of energy, which Kingsley surely brings, and assume it to mean the guy's acting up a storm. Well, chewing scenery is acting up a storm, too - just not good acting. \nThe rest of the cast is relatively faceless, including Amanda Redman as Gil's ex-porn-star wife (I just wanted to use the words \"porn star\" in this review somewhere!). None of them stand out above the others; Kingsley only stands out on the basis of name recognition. I'm a little amazed that this received the praise it did, particularly for Kingsley himself. It's not solid entertainment at all, and not worth the bucks to see it, although the plot does scamper along pretty well. But because of the poor enunciation (for Americans, at least), the complexities of the plot never come to light, frustrating the viewer."}

In this one, the \"Pinocchio\" is an advanced robot who looks and acts like a real boy. David (Haley Joel Osment) is the first of his robot line to have actual feelings, and naturally he runs into problems reconciling these emotions with his logical side.   David is purchased by the Swinton family as a sort-of replacement for their son, who lies in stasis, stricken by an incurable disease. Mr. Swinton (Sam Robards) buys David to help his wife deal with the stress of losing their son; but it's kind of the same as buying a new puppy immediately after one's dog has been killed. Monica Swinton (Frances O'Connor) doesn't quite know what to make of the new addition to her family. She resents the intrusion, and doesn't know how to treat David. Unlike traditional serving robots, David is designed to be a cute little kid, which means he doesn't just sit back and wait for orders to be given; he's supposed to be more interactive and proactive, learning as he goes. David develops a real love for his adoptive mother. But when the younger Swinton actually is cured from his disease and returns home, things get very complicated. It's soon clear that David's days with the family are numbered. Monica knows that if David is returned to the manufacturer, he'll be taken apart, and she's also grown fond of the boy robot. She takes him to a huge forest where decommissioned androids and other robots wander, thinking he'll be better off with those of his own kind. But David's love for his mother outweighs all else, and through all of his adventures - in which he meets up with fellow robot Gigalo Joe (Jude Law), his one goal is to return to his beloved mommy. He is under the impression that he can somehow become a real boy, Monica will take him back and they can all live happily ever after.\n If you're in the mood for absurdist cinema, this is a treat. The special effects, which were nominated for an Oscar, really are good. But special effects aren't as special as they used to be, now that most big-budget films have them in some way. True, the makeup (by past Oscar winner Rick Baker) and costumes are excellent, but the story and acting, sadly, are not. Each scene elicits an \"oh, come on\" reaction, as it tries to top the previous scene. \"Look at me! Look at me!\" the scenes practically cry out. It's a self-absorbed mess. The theme's not a new one, but the makers of this piffle tried way too hard to make the story different from all of the other \"I want to be a real boy\" movies; there's a fine line between quirky and unbelievable.   Yes, you should suspend your disbelief for this movie; you should suspend it, expel it, and forget you ever had it. There's plenty that doesn't make a bit of sense, and a really schmaltzy ending. It tries its damnednest to pluck at your heartstrings, playing out more like a cheesy disease-of-the-week TV movie than a serious, heartfelt film.\n Osment's not bad, under the circumstances. One great thing about playing a robot is that one can give a poor performance, and it'll seem believable. There are also a few celebrity cameos that were completely unnecessary, although I won't ruin their surprise by outing them here.\n Most of the middle portion of this film (which clocks in at over two and a half hours) is deadeningly dull, and none of it was worth the megahype that DreamWorks mustered up for it. This is a good movie to leave on as you fall asleep."}

It ranks up there with Don't Look in the Basement, Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead, and Don't Tell Her It's Me (all real titles). The title's not terribly descriptive, but it fits in with the plotline itself, which is pretty faceless.\nDouglas must be used to these roles by now, the domineering, I'm-in-charge, alpha male. He's played a powerful lawyer (Disclosure), a powerful financial genius (The Game), a powerful drug czar (Traffic), and the powerful leader of the free world (The American President). He basically sleepwalks through this movie, phoning in a pretty lethargic performance that adds no nuance to the character.\nIn fact, the movie's a lot like Mercury Rising, which starred Bruce Willis as a renegade FBI agent protecting an autistic boy who had broken a supersecret government code. Will Nathan get the code from his traumatized patient in time to save his girl's life? With this type of movie, that question's no more than pure rhetoric. If you're at Point A and can see where the end of the movie (Point B) is, then the only way the movie can distinguish itself is to provide a gimmick. That gimmick is that the code that these evil bad guys (led by a superficially menacing Sean Bean) need is locked in the screwed-up mind of Elisabeth Burrows (newcomer Brittney Murphy), who isn't autistic but is so traumatized by the murder of her father years ago that she hardly speaks to anyone and reacts violently when approached. On top of all of this, Nathan's stock pretty wife Jessie (Skye McCole Bartusiak, looking like Sela Ward) is stuck in their apartment with a broken leg. (And you know, when a character has something slightly off-kilter about them, that quirkiness will play a role in the movie, somehow. It's like when a guy has a lisp - and then it turns out that the bad guy has a lisp, too. These things are hardly ever put in for no reason, you see.)\nOnce we've established that the Bad Guys have the daughter and that the wife is stuck in bed with a cast, then we know Nathan must solve it on his own. To make sure, the Bad Guys tell him not to go to the cops. They don't need to say this, though; the Hero never goes to the cops. Too dangerous. Who'd believe him? And so on. So our stalwart, prominent psychiatrist goes it alone, for only he may save the day. Snore.\nMaybe it's Douglas, and maybe it's the shallowness of the supporting cast, but in so many of his movies the other actors seem to melt away. Sometimes it's because he's off the wall, a ham who doesn't chew the scenary so much as swallow it hole and regurgitate it onto your TV. (It's the Michael Douglas show! No wait; that was a different Mike Douglas.)\nThe wonderful thing about characters with mental issues is that you can make those problems do whatever the script requires, with no real nod to logic or cohesion. These characters can be manipulated to fit any plot stupidities, including the dopey actions of the main characters. Don't Say a Word falls easily into this mold. And any movie that leans heavily on one gimmick isn't much of a movie, unless the characterizations and performances are well above par for the genre. They're not.\nThis is drivel best relegated to the bargain bins at Blockbuster. From start to finish, there's not one true note to be found. Suspend your disbelief? You need to suspend it and then kick the chair out from underneath it. This movie doesn't approach credibility; it's a mere tourist in the land of reality."}

If your spouse was killed by a drunk driver, you'd probably not rest easy until the jerk was caught - if then. But most of us would let the cops do their job, even though we anxiously await results and some sort of closure. But see, that's the key. You'd wait there, a bundle of nerves. Arnold Schwarzenegger goes to Colombia.\nGordy (Ah-nuld) is a heroic fireman in Los Angeles. He's late to pick up his wife and kid at the doctor's office, and BLAM! A bomb blows up the whole area, killing his wife and son (there were dignitaries in the area that Colombia terrorists were targeting). The CIA knows who the bad guy is - he calls himself El Lobo - but the catch is that no one's ever seen his face. But Gordy has. He saw him seconds before the bomb went off (although of course, he didn't know then) and therefore becomes the only American to be able to recognize the Numero Uno Bad Guy.\nFiguring that El Lobo's hitailed it back to Columbia, Gordy follows. He sneaks in as only Ah-nuld can, through Panama. This marks Schwarzenegger's wandered south of the border, following Commando (1985) and Predator (1987). He's a man on a mission: to find and dispense of the man who murdered his family.\nThis is certainly one of those movies you wouldn't believe if it were shown as a true story, and that's partly because some of the stuff Gordy does lies somewhere beyond the realm of credulity. But that's somewhat beside the point. You don't watch this movie as if it were a documentary, you watch it as if it were a cartoon, which it surely is. Heck, even the acting's cartoonish.\nGetting into Columbia isn't easy, but of course Our Man has a plan, and even when things go awry, Our Man somehow triumphs. Because he can do that, you see. It just wouldn't do to have him be anything but a superhero. If you or I or anyone else tried half the stuff Gordy did, we'd be caught, gutted, and disemboweled before the first commercial on NYPD Blue. But not Gordy, who's tougher than steel.\nBut one thing worth mentioning is that this movie wouldn't work with just any beefy actor. The fact that that audience buys into the whole \"Arnold-as-Superman\" thing is a testament to his appeal; if you didn't believe Gordy could do it, you'd have no movie to watch.\n\nThis movie was held back from release following the September 11 attacks, and some of the parallels are eerie. There's an attack in the movie on American soil. How would we have reacted to that scene prior to September 11? Probably wouldn't have raised an eyebrow over it. Now, however, the scene is viewed in a whole new context. That scene - and the subsequent violence - are now lent a distinct air of reality and believability, further buttressed by the inimitable secure personality of the giant Schwarzenegger.\nArnold returns to his tried-and-true Predator-Commando-Terminator roots here, and he pulls it off quite well, considering he's now over 50. A twentysomething couldn't do the stuff he's doing in this movie. Okay, so maybe his double's doing a lot of it, but still - the man's still in great shape, doing what he loves to do and what we love to do - kick major bad-guy ass.\nI'm giving this movie relatively high marks because I like this kind of movie - a fast, violent action movie. If this isn't your cup of tea, you might want to scale the rating down a notch or two."}

Or remember in Parenthood, when Steve Martin's kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he'll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.\nJohn Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He's socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.\nBut John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia's a tough disease, folks - it's still not fully understood, and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium, as doctors struggle to find a cure.\nRussell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says \"Russell Crowe\", you'll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all, he's playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role, and he's unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one, because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors, this is the kiss of death, because then they're exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe; if anything, this proves once and for all that he's a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him, but I think that when actors are labeled as a \"hunk\" - their skills as actors aren't seen as very substantial. Hey, looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck, and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.\nAnd he ages well, too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time, ending with Nash's acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy; he looks completely genuine. And that's the essence of Crowe's performance. It's sincere, never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise, elegance, and is utterly astounding in the role.\nHis supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be; in most roles, she's the eye candy. But this role had meat to it, and she held her own. It wasn't an easy role to play, and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies, that one moment, that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.\nAnd yes, this does have some very, very touching moments. The final scene, while predictable (even if you don't know the outcome in real life), will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes, I'll admit it, it got me right here. But it's okay; I did that old 'guy-crying-in-movie-theater' trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid, you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously; people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly, but at least they won't think you're a girly man.\nAt any rate, it's certainly one of the best movies of the year. Everything's in place: the direction, the photography, and especially the acting."}

What made that film work was that it was low budget (and therefore more realistic) and that the gore was so... well, so disgusting, for 1974. But the best part of the movie was that it was a popcorn movie - the kind where you'd warn the people in the movie not to go downstairs, and so on. It's pure escapism. Jeepers Creepers fits into this mold. It's an escape movie. You don't watch it to learn things; you watch it for plain old mind-numbing entertainment. \nThe movie is about two siblings driving along a long, quiet country road on their way home from college. A madman in a big, souped-up, customized truck tailgates them, then runs them off the road. Later, they see him dumping something down a huge pipe. And sure, they stop to investigate. I mean, wouldn't you? \nAs in many escapism movies, the characters consistently do profoundly stupid things, like climb down the pipe, don't go for help, don't get the heck out there like right now, and so on. It's the old Scooby Doo mentality; let's solve this puzzle, huh gang?\nFor much of the movie, I laughed heartily. But hey! you say. It's not a comedy, is it? Right on, it's not a comedy.

That's not a good quality to have in a horror movie, folks.\nSo I had a good idea of how I was going to rate this movie. \"Pretty cheesy,\" I thought to myself. \"Effects aren't bad, acting is, kind of forgettable.\"\n\nBut then the final 20 minutes or so came. And man, let me tell you - this is some serious fear. The final few scenes are better than anything else in the movie put together. There's dramatic tension AND good effects.

Like director Baz Luhrmann's earlier Romeo and Juliet, this one leans very heavily on style. And when one leans heavily on something with little substance, one falls firmly on one's face. Which is what this unfortunate movie does.\nIt tries hard not to be dull and boring, and in doing so eschews any semblance of nuance. Everyone and everything in this movie is loud, boisterous, screaming to be heard about the maddening din. Sure, this might be 1900 Paris, but if it was, I bet they had a run on Excedrin the following morning - if there ever were following mornings. I don't doubt people were as debaucherous as this; they surely are now in some circles.\n\nA naive young writer (Ewan Macgregor) enters the world of the artists in Paris at the turn of the 20th century and quickly falls in love with an alluring chanteuse (Nicole Kidman). That's great. A love story is fine. But sadly, Macgregor and Kidman have less romantic chemistry than a can a tuna and an angry kitty cat. Each is a respectable thespian in his or her own right, but such talent is completely overwhelmed by the roar of the madness. Kidman can be very effective in much quieter roles, such as Dead Calm, Malice, and To Die For, but really most anyone could have played this particular role (provided they were tall and had 7-foot legs). Macgregor's been in some good films, both small (Trainspotting) and large (Star Wars Episode 1). Both would have been much better off passing up on this junk.\nThe original was an inspired musical featuring some fine tunes. This one is a mish mash of pop hits from the 1970s to the present, often sung at inopportune, inexplicable times (and sometimes not even in the song's entirety). There's plenty of visual goings-on, however, for the viewer to forget the music sucks. Admittedly, the cinematography is superb, eliciting images upon images; there really is some magician behind the camera for this one. But rather than being a masterpiece in and of itself, the camera artwork merely overwhelms everything else about the movie. If I wanted to do nothing but see compelling images, I'd go to an art house and gaze at Monet for a few hours. Or, in the case of this flop, Peter Max or perhaps early Andy Warhol."}

Even if you've never read any of the books, the story is woven in such a delicious, viewer-friendly manner that even the most curmudgeonly of us will appreciate the tale.\nThe Lord of the Rings trilogy (actually four books, if you include the prequel The Hobbit) tells the tale of the quest to return an all-powerful (and all-evil) ring to the fire from whence it was forged in an effort to destroy it forever. \nJ. R. R. Tolkien's books are very rich with detail, particularly with historical detail. The world of Middle earth is populated by all sorts of creatures, and man is not yet the dominating species. In Tolkien's world, sorcery, might, and pastoral settings all exist  together, albeit not always in perfect harmony. \nThe first several minutes of the 178-minute movie (subtitled The Fellowship of the Ring, the title of the first book in the series) describes the terrible history of the One Ring. If someone had not read the books, it might be difficult for them to comprehend the story; thankfully, the startling special effects and brisk storytelling make it all worthwhile and informative.\nIn short, here's how the tale unfolds. Back in the old days, the ultimate evil being Sauron forged a series of powerful rings. Some he gave to the Elvish race (known for their wisdom). Some he gave to Men. Some he gave to Dwarves (known for their strength and courage). But there was one Ring that was designed to bind all of the others together, to be as strong as all the others combined. With this ring, one could rule all of Middle Earth. But the evil Sauron was defeated by Men, and his hand (well, the hand of his physical being) was chopped off; a Man recovered the Ring, but fell prey to its power. The Ring eventually sunk to the bottom of a river, where it was recovered by an eerie creature named Gollum, who also fell prey to its allure. And from this creature, the tiny Hobbit Bilbo Baggins acquired the Ring, not knowing its power and keeping it to himself for 60 years. Bilbo gives the Ring to his nephew, Frodo Baggins.\nWhen the Ring's existence is confirmed, a meeting involving all of the creatures of Middle Earth is convened in the Elvish home of Elron, the lord of the Elves. It is decided that the Ring must be returned to the peak of Mount Doom, where it must then be cast into the fires that made it (and where it can be unmade). Frodo volunteers for the horrible task, and representatives from each of the major species in Middle Earth are assembled to aid him in his quest: Aragorn and Boromir from the land of Men; Leglolas the Elf; Gimli the Dwarf; Gandalf the wizard; and the Hobbits, Frodo, Samwise, Peregrin, and Merry. These nine are chosen to travel the great distance to the land of evil, and cast the ring back.\nQuite a daunting task, isn't it? And while all of this is going on, the evil of Sauron is aware that the Ring exists, and he is preparing his armies for his own quest - recover the Ring at all costs. \nLuckily, the good guys have some all-stars on their side. Gandalf (played very memorably by Ian McKellen) is more than just a circus magician - he's one of the most powerful wizards in history (that's not common knowledge at the outset, at least not to the naive Hobbits, but it's apparent rather quickly). Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) is more than a mere Ranger, he's also of noble blood, and has the courage of a thousand lions. These two leaders are the soul and minds of the Fellowship. But the story's focus is on the tiny Ringbearer, Frodo. You see, carrying this ring isn't quite the same as, for example, carrying a wedding ring up the aisle to the about-to-be-wed. Frodo is drawn to the ring but still has such amazing inner strength that he can stick to his mission. He knows its power, and as he gets closer and closer to Mount Doom the pressure of carrying the jewelry is absolutely overwhelming. It's as if you or I walked around the office carrying a Volkswagen.\nBesides the story, there are two other intangible stars at work here: the special effects and the makeup/costumery. There's one particular scene in which Gandalf rides a giant bird (an eagle, perhaps) to safety. My mind immediately assumed this could happen; but upon reflection I believe that this was wizardry of another time, another example of the magnificence of special effects. Some of the scenes are absolutely jaw-dropping. The Fellowship must travel through the Mines of Moria; they tackle the precipice of a giant snow-covered mountain; they hike over marshes and through forests. And at no point does one think that all of this is make-believe.\nAnother asset is the cinematography. Gandalf is a human, although a tall one in the books. The Hobbits are halflings, or little people - they're much smaller than humans. Their homes are smaller, and Gandalf has to duck to enter. But side by side, Gandalf and Bilbo look exactly as they should - Gandalf perhaps six feet tall, and Bilbo perhaps four. Not bad when you consider both roles are played by grown men (Bilbo is played by Ian Bannen)!\n\nAnd the acting! Mortensen as Aragon! John Rhys-Davies as Gimli the Dwarf! The great Christopher Lee as Saruman the White, a fellow wizard of Gandalf! Sean Bean as Boromir!  \nAnd the actresses are even better. Liv Tyler as Arwen the elf and Cate Blanchett as the Lady Galadriel are absolutely stunning. These are not just beautiful women playing ethereal roles; their screen presence is off the charts. \nThe only downside to the acting is Elijah Wood as Frodo. Throughout the movie, he looked like a deer caught in headlights, constantly stunned and shocked. Wood's never been a particularly good actor, and his limitations are unfortunately readily amplified by this major role. But he's not horribly miscast, either. Most of the time, the action in the movie is so intense you forget what a dull performance he's turning in.\n\nI've read all of the books, so of course I knew what to expect here. The friend I went to the movie with had not read the books, so I asked her if she found it boring, uninteresting, or confusing. She answered in the negative, surprising considering the length of the film. But here's something you can expect, if you've not read these wonderful books. There are three books, of course, and the other two movies have been filmed already. The ending of this film does not tie everything up neatly (as the first book did not). The filmmakers faced a very difficult task in ending the movie, and they chose to stick with the book's ending (which I certainly will not reveal here). But please, if you watch this film, realize there are two more to come, and that the ending of this is also the beginning to the next one. \nThere are plenty of intense scenes in the movie, probably too intense for very young kids. This is NOT a children's story (the books certainly weren't, either), although it's one that can be enjoyed by all. If I had kids, I would be reading these books to them as often as possible. This is epic storytelling at its absolute best. There is never a slow moment in the movie (or the books). The movie is a masterpiece, one of the finest examples of moviemaking we've seen in a long, long time."}

No problem.", "content": "Thank goodness for popcorn movies. Okay, so this one doesn't completely qualify, as at certain moments during the film the brain is encouraged to wake up and breathe a little, but it's still an exciting escapist movie. The plot centers around a massive heist - three major casinos in Las Vegas, all robbed simultaneously. \nThe ringleader is Danny Ocean (George Clooney), recently sprung from the big house. He has an ulterior motive for robbery (well, other than the $150 million); seems his ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts), who left him while he was in stir, is now with the owner of the three casinos, Harry Benedict (Andy Garcia), a suave, cool, egomaniac. He looks like he's been patterned after Steve Wynn, who owned (still does, probably) many casinos in the desert and who was always at odds with his eastern rival, Donald Trump.\n\nSo Danny's out, and he has a plan. Plans are always good. He first recruits old pal Dusty (Brad Pitt), who's busy teaching poker to nincompoop Hollywood actors. Dusty and Danny get together the rest of the gang, sprawled all over the country, including the Malloy brothers (Scott Caan and Casey Affleck); Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon), a novice whose dad worked with Danny; Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner!); demolitionist Roscoe Means (Don Cheadle, sporting one heck of a cockney accent); Yen the acrobat (Shaobo Qin); Frank the blackjack dealer (Bernie Mac); and their financial backer, Ruben Tischkoff (Elliott Gould!). \nIt's a game cast, and it looked like they all had a lot of fun making the movie. I was surprised to see old hands Reiner and Gould in this one, especially since so many Gen-X people are involved. Reiner's character is a lot like that of Lawrence Tierney in Reservoir Dogs, except that Sol's not in charge of anything (and, in fact, has to be coaxed out of retirement). And Gould looked to have put on about 70 pounds - whether that's padding or he put it on for the movie, I'll never know. \nThe rest of the cast did a fine job. The best performances were by Pitt, Damon, and Clooney. But Julia Roberts - well, she had no chemistry with the man she was with (Garcia), none with the man she had been with before (Clooney), and none with the camera. In fact, she looked terrible in closeup, as if someone had strapped her down and injected her lips with about 10,000 cc's of collagen. I know she has full lips, but sheesh! Plus they were supercoated with this Mary Kay lipstick that only served to enhance the gaudy image.\nThis takes the basic plot of the original 1960 movie (starring the Rat Pack, with Sinatra in the lead) and reworks it a little. It's more stylish, more elegant, more thrilling than the original, and how often can one say that?\n\nBut of course the real story's the caper. They have to bust into the vault, get this money - and it's in CASH, mind you - and walk out. No one's ever come close. This is a movie where you definitely have no problem rooting for the good guys. It's part robbery thriller, part Robin Hood, part Mission:Impossible. It's well-written, although it's not as multilayered a film as some of Steven Soderbergh's other movies, such as Traffic, Out of Sight (with Clooney), Erin Brockovich (with Roberts), or even sex, lies, and videotape. But it really is a blast."}

The workers at the company get the energy by emerging from kids' closets and scaring the beejeezus out of them. The subsequent screams are then bottled and used to power Monstropolis.\nThe company's top scarer is James P. Sullivan, aka Sulley (voiced by John Goodman). His sidekick/best friend is Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal). Here's how it works. Doors from kids' rooms appear from a giant warehouse in the company's behemoth building. The scarer opens the door and steps into the kid's bedroom and scares the heck out of the little tyke. As the screams come, they fill up empty canisters, the kind in which one might find helium for balloons, which the sidekick keeps at the ready. Then the monster steps out, the leaderboard reflects the changes (they're very competitive there, you know), and another door is procured. The sidekick takes care of all of the paperwork. But kids aren't getting scared the way they used to, and there's a power shortage afoot.\nThere's one huge rule, though. Never come in contact with one of the kids, or any of the stuff from their rooms. The kids are toxic and will kill you on contact. (At one point, a particularly gruesome monster comes out of the room with a tiny sock velcroed to his fur; an emergency is declared, and a crack Kid Detection team races in to decontaminate the scene - and the monster, who gets quite a nasty shave. It's all innocuous enough, but it's also reflective of current events, although the movie was certainly written a while ago.)\nOne evening, Sulley offers to do the paperwork so Mike can go on a date with his beloved Celia (Jennifer Tilly). There aren't supposed to be any doors left on the floor after hours, but there one is, and Sulley's just inquisitive enough to open it. Whoops! A kid comes out. Hilarity ensues. Sulley races to get Mike, and they both panic. I mean, think of it! A KID, there in Monstropolis! They fear for their lives! And of course all the while the kid, whom Sulley names Boo, is being a cute, adorable, curious little rugrat. \nThis film was done by the Pixar people, the same nice folks who brought Toy Story and A Bug's Life to you. The animation is wonderful, although I'm not sure it's quite on par with Toy Story as far as the monsters go. The animation of the little girl, however, is fabulous. The animators must have kids of their own, because every nuance I can think of that a little kid would have was captured beautifully in this movie. \nThe actors providing the voices are a lot of fun, too. Whoever cast John Goodman and Billy Crystal is probably suffering from a dislocated shoulder from patting themselves on the back so much. The two stars have great chemistry, bordering on Laurel and Hardy-ish.\nThis is a bellyacher of a film, although admittedly it's not one that the intellectual snob would particularly enjoy. While the audience is the teeter-totter set, there is no overabundance of flatulence jokes - in fact, there aren't any. This is good clean (literally) fun."}

Sure, we'd put some men in space, but no one had landed on any foreign worlds. We imagined, through the voices of such authors as Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov, interstellar travel and advanced civilizations. But all of that seemed to be part of the distant future in 1968.\nHere were are 33 years later, and while we haven't traveled to other galaxies or met any other civilizations (advanced or otherwise, Whitley Strieber's experiences notwithstanding), we have put a man on the moon and are hard at work on the international space station. In short, in 33 years we've come a long way, baby.\nAnyone who has seen the original 1968 Planet of the Apes knows that the ending is a real kicker. I certainly won't give it away here, because there's an entire generation that hasn't seen the movie and most certainly should. Suffice to say that the original is unique, not simply another sci-fi flick.\nThe new one is termed a \"rethinking\" of the original. Tim Burton, who gave us Edward Scissorhands, Batman, PeeWee's Big Adventure, and Sleepy Hollow,is the director here, and the film is full of his stylish touch.\nMark Wahlberg is Captain Leo Davidson, an astronaut in 2029 on a small space station that is conduction experiments on chimps. An electrical storm strikes, and a chimp is sent out to survey the cause. When the animal does not return, Davidson launches himself - against his commander's orders - to find him. Next thing he knows, his space pod is crash landing on an unknown planet inhabited by talking, aggressive apes - with humans as slaves.\nDavidson is captured by the apes along with other humans, but escapes. His plan - get back to where his pod crashed, find his GPS-like device that will allow him to locate his mother ship, and get back home. But it's a long way back to the pod, and he suddenly has thousands of apes after him.\nLuckily, he has on his side Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), a kindhearted ape who feels empathy toward the humans. Ari, of course, symbolizes animal lovers on Earth; she cannot understand why her fellow apes treat their humans so badly. \"We can learn much from them,\" she claims, but her claims fall on deaf ears. Davidson, with the help of Ari, leads a small band of refugee humans (including the Daena, played by the delicious Estelle Warren) to his pod, where he makes some startling discoveries, none of which will be revealed here. (If you've seen the original and know the surprise ending, the discoveries Davidson makes are as intriguing as that ending.)\nHot on the trail of the astronaut and his friends is the evil General Thade (Tim Roth) and his fiercest warrior Colonel Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan). The makeup jobs on all of the apes are astounding, and the actors are completely unrecognizable under their disguises. The general has been told by his ailing father (an uncredited Charlton Heston, who starred in the 1968 original) that humans, in the time before time, humans brought violence to their planet; now that apes dominate, humans must be destroyed.\n\nAs with the original, this is a fascinating treatise not only on how we treat  other animals but on how we treat ourselves. Is it truly accurate to say that humans are civilized and the apes are the savages? The film actually makes you think about such things, but it's no philosophical hodge-podge of mumbo-jumbo. It's a exciting, powerful movie, worth watching on just about every level."}

It's also applicable to this movie, as one is probably better off not having a brain when watching it - or, if one is in possession of a brain, it'll be all mushy and spongy afterwards.\nCan you see where I'm going with this? Swordfish is profoundly stupid, with profoundly stupid characters doing profoundly stupid things. It's an insult to anyone's intelligence.  While you watch it, your brain turns to jello.\nNow, granted, this happens with a lot of current action movies, but this one sinks so quickly and so authoritatively into the great abyss of suckitude that you can hardly pause to catch your breath. Oh, but wait - it's not so exciting that you actually lose your breath.\nGabriel Shear (John Travolta, sporting yet another goofy hairdo), is a megalomaniacal hacker with oodles of cash. He's reclusive but dangerous; he hires world-famous hackers to break into bank accounts and steal money electronically. He's ruthless, too, caring more about his single goal (which is thankfully revealed midway through the movie) than about other people's lives, no matter how many are lost.\nShear picks up ex-hacker Stanley (Hugh Jackman), who went to prison for hacking into the FBI and setting back their computer system two years. Stanley's forbidden from seeing his evercute daughter by his trailer-trash, porn-star ex-wife, and he lacks the cash to fight the custody in court. Can you see where this is leading?\nShear sends one of his top lieutenants, Ginger (Halle Berry) to pick up Stanley, and she convinces him to sign on. It's a simple gig - he gets $100,000 just for meeting Gabriel, and he can walk away if he doesn't like the deal he'll be offered. Right. Like anyone in a movie like this would say no to that. If Stanley were really bright, he'd sense right off that Gabriel is a Bad Guy - people don't just give $100,000 away for a meeting, you know. But Stanley's not too swift, so he goes along. Presumably he also goes because Halle Berry asked him nicely.\nAt any rate, Stanley accepts the cash to go visit Shear, who needs someone to break an encrypted network in 60 seconds. I'm not going to bog down this review with technical lingo about how Stanley accomplishes it, mainly because I have no idea. The way hacking is almost always portrayed on the silver screen is by having one disheveled (usually young, although Stanley's in his early to mid-thirties) hacker type really, really, really fast, hitting a million keys in about 15 seconds, then dramatically hitting \"enter\" and looking triumphant. So Stanley has to pull off this kind of feat, under enormous pressure (in more ways than one).\n\nNow, by this point you're supposed to be sympathizing with Stanley. He's the good guy, right? He's doing this against his will, right? And he only wants to see his daughter, right? The screenwriters don't leave much out when making Stanley out to be a solid Good Guy. Heck, the only reason he cracked the FBI computer was out of a sense of goodwill. So he's a hacker with a cause.\nOrdinarily, you'd think a movie about hacking into computers would be dull - and it would be if all we had to look at was a computer screen. So Shear crashes some cars, takes hostages, commandeers a bus and a helicopter, and so on. It's kind of like Speed, but not ON speed, if you catch my drift. There's only so many of the same old crashes and smashes before the ol' consciousness decides to take an extended nap.\nOn the video and DVD boxes for Swordfish, there's a warning about the violent content. The warning notes that the movie was made before September 11, 2001 and that there are some scenes in the movie that might be unsettling for some people. I'll save you the trouble - those scenes are when Gabriel acts like a terrorist overtly, rather than just subtly (you keep expecting him to do an evil laugh), and while it is possible people who lost loved ones on September 11 might feel a little uneasy with them, I think they'd react more strongly to the mind-numbing stupidity of the entire movie. Why focus on just a couple of scenes when the whole thing is like a giant drone bee, buzzing endlessly and saying nothing?\nA quick look at the cast. The good guys look good, the bad guys look bad. Ginger's on the fence - is she good? Is she bad? Is she both? Do we care? Halle Berry hasn't had a good role in a few years, but this one should have been easy for her. It just seems to me that the sole reason for having her there was for her to look pretty. She's not bad at that - and even does a gratuitous topless scene - but lends little in the way of substance to a movie that was already sorely lacking it. Jackman's not bad, but he's not nearly as commanding as he needs to be. It's another one of those movies where the criminal is a much stronger character and overwhelms that of the good guy.\nParents: There's a lot of violence in the movie, and although most of it is cartoonish, some of it might hit too close to home. Most adults can see through violence in movies with no problem, separating it from reality, but kids don't always have that ability."}

The movie is told in flashback, as Pollock's story has been illustrated by a Life magazine article (complete with pictures) covering his career to that point. When the movie begins, the artist is living with his brother in a tiny apartment and occasionally exhibiting a piece or two at local galleries. Then fellow artist Lee Krasner (Marcia Gay Harden) discovers his work and puts her own career aside in order to help further his. The couple falls in love and moves to the Hamptons so that Jackson may concentrate more on his work than on his drinking.\nThis works for a while, but as with so many geniuses, Pollock's life is never rosey. Even when Peggy Guggenheim (Amy Madigan) champions him, he still turns to booze. And folks, when Jackson Pollock gets drunk (at least according to the movie), he gets mean. Violent. Enraged. And even sober, he seems a little off-center, like he was smacked with a two-by-four once when still in his formative years.\nAs with many biopics, there are cliches. But most people's lives have cliches - it's only when we see the cliches in a movie that we even consider them to be cliches. Jackson rises, he falls, he fights with the people who are trying to help him, and so on. This doesn't make any of his life seem less real, however, mostly because of a stellar performance from Harris (who also directed). Harris's Pollock is multilayered, but he's never portrayed as a nice guy to whom bad things happen; some of his misery is self-inflicted, and some is well deserved. But at the same time, Harris doesn't demonize Pollock; he's shown to be human, just not humane. It's a fine line that most actors find very difficult to tread, but somehow the veteran actor pulls it off.\nAs his wife, lover, muse, and agent, Marcia Gay Harden is absolutely mesmerizing. You may recall that she won the Oscar for Best Supporting Oscar for her work here, and she undeniably deserved the accolade. She turns in a performance that really belies her mostly unsung acting career. Even better, the chemistry between Harris and Gay Harden is fascinating;  you can easily believe they're lovers and fighters in real life.\nAnd Jackson's paintings are not given short shrift, either; one would not have blamed the producers for showing less of his work and more of the actors interacting with each other, because expressionist art is extremely subjective, and the producers do run the risk of people saying to themselves, \"Sheesh, my kid could paint better than that!\" Well, too bad. Maybe someday that kid will get a great biographical movie, too."}

Whether this man is a real person is never made clear, but Romulus's rage toward him certainly isn't. He also hallucinates that his late wife is giving him advice and what-for, and that there are things in his head that tell him what to do. Yes, by almost any standard, this guy's a little wacked in the head.   On Valentine's Day, Romulus looks outside his cave and sees a young man frozen to death in a tree. The police, after investigating, determine that the man wasn't quite in his right state of mind (since he was hardly dressed for winter and had been seen running around in that attire); but Romulus is skeptical, since a friend of the dead man claims a famous local avant-garde artist, David Leppenraub, killed him. Romulus's estranged daughter is a precinct cop, but of course she won't listen to the ravings of anyone, even her dad. So he sets out to do his own detective work.   This does make for an interesting movie, especially since Romulus's prowess at the piano makes a few appearances. But other than Romulus himself, this isn't much more than a standard detective story, one in which the 'detective' isn't even directly involved with the crime.\n Jackson is the entire show here. Just like Jodie Foster in Nell, Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, and even James Belushi in Homer and Eddie, a character with severe mental issues is the main focus. But unlike those other characters, Romulus actually uses his 'deficiencies' to help him solve the murder. It's not as if Jackson puts up a sign - \"I am deranged, therefore I am turning in a magnificent performance\".  Too often, actors (not necessarily those named above) use a mental handicap as a crutch for their character. This really isn't the case with the gifted Jackson, who performs exceedingly well, giving a powerful, galvanizing performance. Each word is dripping with energy. Even if the character of Romulus wasn't intended to grip you by your conscience, Jackson's work would have done the trick. Usually, one can detach oneself from a movie, kind of watch it from afar, maybe even guessing ahead who the killer is. But Jackson's so good, you can't really do that.

(The group was kicked out of a similar New Hampshire town during filming; they had to build an old mill, but when they were kicked out, the town held the mill for ransom.) Waterford, VT is the perfect little town, and the company quickly begins to work. Director Walt Price (William H.

Chaos invades the town, which alternately meets the challenge with bemusement and an eye for opportunity.\nPrice has a lot of problems on the set.

His leading man (Alec Baldwin) has a bad habit of hooking up with underage girls (\"Hey, everyone's gotta have a hobby,\" he's fond of saying). His timid but honest screenwriter (Philip Seymour Hoffman) can't write, since the company's lost his trusty old typewriter. \n\nAnd to top it all off, the town has no old mill. None. It had one, yes, but it burned down in the 1960s during a spate of mysterious fires. So to fix the problem, Price demands that Joe the screenwriter rewrite the movie to reflect the lack of a mill, which of course means changing the title. \n\nMamet does a wonderful job lampooning his own industry, and from some of the performances you get the idea that these folks aren't acting as much as being themselves. Baldwin, for example, has long had the reputation of being a bit self-centered on the set, and the machinations of Price and his producer, Marty (David Paymer), are fun to watch. \nThis is a lively film. There's plenty going on, although a lot does center on the problems and issues of Joe (who's hardly ever called that in the movie; he's usually just referred to as \"the screenwriter\"), who falls for the pretty and talented Ann (Rebecca Pidgeon), the organizer and main impetus for the town's stage troupe. Hoffman's portrayal is sincere and believeable, and his interaction with Pidgeon is a real treat. Mamet's known for using the same actors in his movies, and Pidgeon and Macy are both regulars of his stock company. Some of the best directors employ this tactic, as it build loyalty among a group of actors. If you're comfortable working with someone, then you might want to keep working with them, and if the smoothness of this movie is any indication, Mamet worked pretty well with his excellent cast."}

They get the idea watching the Keanu Reeves movie Point Break and then watch movies like Reservoir Dogs and Dog Day Afternoon to figure out how exactly to pull the caper off.\nNow, I know what you're thinking. Sounds like a cutesy family movie, right? The kind that warms the cockles, wherever they are. Well, almost. It's a dead-on, surprisingly hilarious comedy, with perfect off-center performances and a crisp, honest script.\nThe last cheerleading movie I saw (and quick, can you name more than a couple anyway? Didn't think so) was the Kirsten Dunst comedy Bring It On. This one blows that out of the water, out of the atmosphere, and out of the solar system. There's no moralizing. There's no good-girls-are-right, bad-girls-are-wrong lesson. Heck, we're talking about teenage girls pulling off a robbery! And one thing that could have sunk this movie early on was a character change. You've seen movies in which a character, faced with a new set of circumstances, does a 180-degree turnaround on how they've behaved up to that point. In this movie, you'd expect the girls to suddenly become flawless professional robbers. Not so. And while their plan has its faults, it's still a plan, buoyed by the vacant aphorisms of their leader, the pregnant and chipper Diane (Marley Shelton). Sing-songy and ebullient, the kids squabble among themselves but, in the true spirit of cheerleading and gosh-darn Girl Scout-like togetherness, they pull together as a team. Hip! Hip! Hooray!\nDecent cheerleading movies are hard to come by. Come to think of it, so are any cheerleading movies. Oh, not that I'm looking, but I can name only two off the top of my head: Bring It On and the legendary, overlooked (okay, just kidding) 1977 opus Satan's Cheerleaders. But the latter's pep squad was in college, so it's different. But I digress.\nTruth be told, there's not a dull moment in the movie. Diane's knocked up before the prom by her dimwit football-hero boyfriend. This guy's so stupid he gets himself fired from such seemingly unfireable jobs as fast-food employee and other glamorous retail employment opportunities. See, in the real world, he'd be upset that the luster had worn off his diamond of an image, having to work with geeks at the video store. But he's a dope, blissfully ignorant. He knows but one thing - that he loves Diane - and being such a dullard is supremely helpful to the film (and isn't easy to do; kudos goes to James Marsden in the role).\nIn short, a real hoot. We've seen many bank robbery movies with their own twists and idiosyncrasies; this one's one of the better ones to come down the pike. Go team go!"}

He forgets things a few minutes after they've occurred. This is caused by emotional and physical trauma he suffered when he once woke up in the middle of the night and saw his wife murdered by asphyxiation. Now Leonard's determined to figure how who the killer is.   To combat his ailment, Leonard takes photos with an Instamatic camera and writes a sentence or two on the back of the picture. He snaps pictures of people whom he's not sure if he just met - and he's also never sure if they're friend or foe. Among the players are Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), the latter of whom supposedly lost a loved one in a similar matter and who therefore feels a sort of kinship with the traumatized Leonard. The most fascinating aspect of this movie is that it's shot out of sequence. Because Leonard's memories are pretty much kaput (he can clearly remember everything up to the murder, but not subsequent memories), we actually get to see the same scenes a couple of times. No, it's not repetitive. Here's an example. Scene fades in, and Leonard is running through backyards, cutting, juking, zigging, and zagging. He suddenly says - for we can hear his thoughts - \"Ok, where am I? He spots another man running nearby. \"Oh,\" Leonard thinks, \"I'm chasing him,\" and he starts to move in the other man's direction. Oops - the man suddenly charges back at Leonard. \"No, wait... he's chasing me!\" Leonard thinks. And in another scene, we see the events leading up to that particular chase, as well as events after it. It's up to the viewer to place them in the right order, but seeing the scenes out of sequence, I think, is very useful here. Things are clearer when they're revisited with more information. Now, when Leonard writes on the back of the photos, what he writes is influenced greatly by whatever has happened just prior to the photograph's creation. This complicates things greatly; if he thinks someone's a nice person, he'll snap the picture and write on the back that they're a nice person. But later, he'll look at the picture - without remembering anything - and take the words at face value. If it says he liked the person, then the person's good, even though he might not have known much about that person.\n There are infinite twists to this movie, and the ending is fantastic. You may know right off that this is no ordinary who-killed-my-wife caper, but you will have a tough time predicting the outcome."}

You'd go see Porky's, you knew you were gonna see some T&A. Oh, and maybe a small heartfelt lesson about how people are generally good, even those who are different from us, as long as we have the same goal of getting laid in mind. Those were such wonderful days! Now, everyone's more jaded, even (especially) the kids. You show a kid the shower scene from Porky's, and he'll love it, but I bet after the first few viewings it won't be as much fun. Kids need something new all the time. Now, American Pie is an R-rated film, so at least the intended audience isn't the teen crowd, exactly, but then neither was Porky's (or any of its knock offs). The cast from the original American Pie is reunited. The time is now one year later, and the gang's home from college for the summer. Jim (Jason Biggs) still has his sexual hang-ups. Remember Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), the band-camp girl? Jim went to the prom with her, and she didn't talk to him after that. But don't worry, she's at band camp again and figures prominently in this movie. It seems Nadia, the exchange student whose escapades with Jim made the Internet, is back in the country and is ready to hook up with our hapless lead character. What to do! Jim still has no experience. The guys try to help him out by renting a lakeside cottage for the summer. Meanwhile, Stifler's (Seann William Scott) still trying to hump everything in sight; Oz (Chris Klein) is remaining celibate while his girlfriend Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) is in France; Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is still lusting after the legendary mother of Stifler, after their much-talked-about union at the party in the first movie; and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is aching after his breakup with Vicky (Tara Reid). There have been no drastic character changes, either; everyone's as you'd expect after a year of college. Which means, of course, that all the guys are hornier than a sex addict in a penny whorehouse. But that's what drives raunch comedies - the testosterone of single-minded males.   As in real life, although the males in the movie have grown up, they still think like high school kids. (And someday this nubile cast will learn that that particular characteristic never really leaves the male of the species!) But while the theme of the movie is sex, sex, and sex, hidden under the layer of bombast and teenage oversexdrive is a theme of tenderness and fallibility. When kids graduate high school, they think they know it all. \"Bring life on!\" they chortle with glee. \"We know it all!\" But there's a certain vulnerability that everyone feels at some point, and that's the issue of sexual conduct for the first time. And here's where American Pie 2 deviates from other raunch films. In those yesteryear movies, there was always tremendous pressure for one schlub to get lucky once and for all. I'm talking huge peer pressure! But in this movie, while all of Jim's friends want him to get laid, they never, ever make him feel like he's below average or beneath them because he's not experienced what they have. And that, to me, makes this a very special movie - although, rest assured, it's still as raunchy as the first one.   In addition, the ending is so unlike those earlier raunchfests that you actually sit there and admire the screenwriters for not, for once, pandering to the least common denominator.   But hold on! Don't look at me like that! You're thinking that if it has good intentions and good messages, how much fun could it really be? Trust me, if you enjoyed the pastry coitus in the first movie, you'll get a kick out of Jim's misadventures in this one, too. The writing is way above par for movies in this genre, and the cast is both lovely to look at more than capable in their deliveries and actions."}

This movie not only tugs at your heartstrings, it rips the strings out and whips you with them. Subtlety ain't this film's strong suit.\nNicolas Cage plays a slick Wall Street powerbroker (the only kind in Hollywood, and probably real life as well) who has it all: money, money, money, and power. Jack Campbell's lacking a family, but he doesn't see that as a bad thing. He's also driven, obsessed with improving the company he works for - he even schedules a \"crisis meeting\" on Christmas Day. This guy's got balls, all right. He's making loot hand over fist, and he's probably on his way to an ulcer or a heart attack before he hits fifty.\nOn Christmas Eve, he gets a phone message from an ex-girlfriend (Tea Leoni). Years earlier, the two of them had made a decision crucial to their lives - he went to England to intern with a prestigious bank, and she went to one of the finest law schools in the country. This facilitated their breakup, but since Jack's made out rather well in the interim, he pays the call little mind. Then that night, he stops by a convenience store to pick up some egg nog. An irate lottery player (the always reliable and watchable Don Cheadle) pulls a gun on the clerk behind the counter. Jack offers to buy the man's lottery ticket in an effort to calm the situation, and even attempts to rehabilitate the hoodlum. \"Cmon,\" Jack tells him, \"everyone needs something.\" \"What do you need?\" Cash asks him. Jack considers the point, then replies there's nothing he needs. \"Ok,\" says Cash, \"but just remember, you got yourself into this.\" Hmm.\nThe next morning, Jack wakes up in bed with the lovely, the delicious, the married-in-real-life-to-David Duchovny Tea Leoni. And he has two kids. And a dog. And whoa! This isn't Jack's life, is it? He doesn't like kids! And here they come, bouncing on the bed he shares with Kate. It's Christmas Day, after all. But Jack's in shock. He panics, grabs the keys to their minivan (Hey! Where's his Porsche?) and dashes off to the city. What's going on?\nSeems Cash is some kinda sorta angel or something (it's never really explained), and he's offering Jack a \"glimpse\" of what his life would have\nbeen like if he had stuck with Kate back in the day. Now, those of us who are of a certain age do wonder from time to time what life would have been like if different decisions had been made. Jack's problem is that his wonderment is now his reality. And it's most certainly not the reality he's looking for! The Single Jack is a hedonist who recognizes only responsibilities to his job. The Married Jack pays more attention to his familial responsibilities.\nSo we have a general fish-out-of-water scenario. Jack knows he's Single Jack, and naturally he has neither knowledge nor memory of life as Married Jack. He doesn't know his friends, his in-laws, his co-workers (he works as a tire salesman!), nothing. He doesn't even know where he lives! Ah yes, mad hijinks ensue. It's like in that Jim Carrey movie The Truman Show - the audience is in on the joke, but the lead character has no idea. See Jack stumble over gettin' jiggy with his wife! See him mumble greetings to friends he doesn't know! See him stand with his mouth agape most of the time, trying in vain to absorb everything.\nAnd, of course, see Jack wrap things up neatly. Too bad it's a two-hour sojourn into schmaltz, though. The problem with the movie isn't that it's sentimental, it's that it's a preachy film, desperate to teach us that Marriage Is Good. And think about it - how many guys do you know are married to someone who looks like Tea Leoni (and is a nice person, too), who goes to work at a tire place with a song in their hearts, who has a loving family with two perfect kids? This life doesn't exist, and damn this movie for making the married versus single issue seem so black and white. Single >bad, marriage = good.\nThe best sentimental films teach lessons with such subtlety that you don't realize you've learned anything until well after the closing credits have rolled. The worst of these films takes a lesson that most people know anyway and proceeds to whack the living crap out of you with it. Ok, ok! I get it! Married life = good things. Got it, ok. And thankfully, Jack got it, too, or we'd still be watching this drivel."}

Played out in the Goodfellas vein, there are characters with colorful personalities to match their colorful names, including Franky Four Fingers, Bullet Tooth Tony, One Punch Mickey O'Neil, Boris the Blade, Turkish, and Brick Top. Stylish and violent - but not in an off-putting way, if you're a fan of the genre, Snatch is all about ice, doublecrossings, fights, guns, blood, guts, ah, the fun never ends.   Brad Pitt plays a pugilistic gypsy (he's \"One Punch\") who delivers a wonderful engaging performance, speaking his lines in an almost unintelligible dialect. You see, everyone in the film (except for Dennis Farina, who plays Cousin Avi from the U.S.) is British. If you've never heard any Briton speak other than the high-class West End junk that the Queen uses, you'll be in for quite of a shock here. But once your ear gets tuned in to the accents, you'll be fine. (Of course, Pitt's Mickey was given that garbled tongue as kind of a way for the writer to poke fun at Britain's own dialects, which are understandably tough for non-Britons to decipher.) There are fixed fights, botched robberies, a dog who may have eaten a diamond, carnivorous pigs, and a getaway driver who has trouble getting away. You remember when Quentin Tarantino reintroduced the caper-gone-bad genre with movies like Pulp Fiction and reservoir Dogs? This one carries the torch a little bit further, and it's carried by a solid ensemble cast that includes Academy Award winner Benicio Del Toro (Frankie Four Fingers), Farina, and Pitt. The rest of the gang you might not recognize, but they're also not characters that simply dissolve into a scene, either. You know the kind - in a subpar gangster movie, all of the hitmen look alike. Not here. This is a cool, fun action film with panache and a touch of humor in the right places (sick humor, though)."}

At the time (as now) it was the definitive expression of the timeless story of Count Dracula. There have been, of course, endless renditions of the 1896 Bram Stoker tale; however, Nosferatu was unique in that the medium of cinema was extremely new in 1924, and the maker had to deal with prejudices against this newfangled form of entertainment, which had to compete with the written word. Now, of course, a new Dracula film need not compete with the original story; it only needs to compete with earlier versions on film. This movie explains the story of how Nosferatu was produced. The director, F. W. Murnau (John Malkovich), is filming his masterpiece in Germany (the widow of the story's author refused to sign the rights to the story, so they couldn't film in Transylvania or use any of the names in the book). His choice to play the part of the vampire Nosferatu is Max Schreck (Willem Dafoe), a beastly, hideous man who will appear to the cast and crew only in character (an early example of Method acting, to be sure). Shreck will not travel or bunk with the company; he will live only in the cave dwelling that the film's protagonist, Count Orlac, calls his home. With a leading man that eccentric, it's no wonder trouble appears on the set. People get sick, others appear listless and not quite into their work. Still, the tenacious Murnau pushes on. He must get his shot! His film must be completed! And as it progresses, he slips a little further into his own world, and Schrek - who, it has been said, played perhaps the ugliest vampire in film history - assumes more and more control over the direction of the movie (although not literally).   Dafoe is unrecognizable in makeup, but the sinister creepiness he brings to most of his roles is evident here. It's an accomplished actor who can play a part in full makeup and still make the role distinguishable from... well, from some chump in a lot of makeup. Dafoe's excellent here, and his interplay with Malkovich is galvanizing. Their scenes together are like an actor's class on How To Emote and Project. There are times when each actor appears to ham it up slightly (or, in the case of Malkovich, more than slightly), but the two of them together constitute a casting coup. This is a wonderful little film, yet another that didn't quite get the acclaim it deserved. The atmosphere is both rich and compelling, both essential qualities for a film that's all about vampires from long ago. This is not a movie that's high on special effects, either; don't expect to see a lot of flash and fancy. It's also a homage to silent movies and to old-time horror films in general. It's a minimalist film in terms of set itself, but much is done with so little."}

The ornery Monkeybone represents all of Stu's repressed feelings, you see. This is not uncommon among cartoonists or comic-book artists (or, for that matter, any artist); the product on the page is often the result of the demons within the artist's tortured soul. Anyway, Stu has a lovely girlfriend named Julie (Bridget Fonda), who just happens to be a doctor. Monkeybone's about to hit big, and Stu's friend/agent (David Foley) is trying his damnedest to merchandise the hell out of the uncontrollable penis with legs. (There's a not-so-subtle symbolism at work here, of course; Stu represses his emotions, including all sexual feelings, and releases them only in the form of Monkeybone on the page.) The day that deals for the commercialization of Monkeybone (reluctantly by Stu, of course) are made, tragedy strikes. A freak car accident leaves Stu in a coma, although somehow his girlfriend escapes unharmed. So there he is, lying in a hospital bed. Trust me, folks, there's comedy afoot here. We're only now getting to it. While clinically dead, Stu finds himself in Hell. Everyone down there knows him, because he's suffered through nightmares for many, many years (and they've served to inspire him in his artistry, too). In 1991, there was a movie called Cool World that covered some of the same ground. In that film, cartoonist Gabriel Byrne ran into all of his old creations - in this one, Stu finds that the denizens down there have been audience to his nightmares since they began, and they've been counting on him to churn out more. Keeps 'em alive, apparently. Oh, but just to complicate things, Julie the doc has found out what causes nightmares. Actually, I guess that actually makes things nice and simple, not more complex. What's worse, down in Hell (actually, an offshoot of Hell called \"Downtown\"), Monkeybone is quite the center of attention, and even has a standup act that humiliates the reserved and introverted Stu.   The movie really consists of two main parts: Stu down in Hell (although not quite dead yet in real life), trying to find a way back up; and Stu back on terra firma, trying to Save The Day. What connects the two parts is that the nefarious Monkeybone, who's ostensibly been helping Stu to get an \"exit pass\" has actually schemed to return to the land of the living himself - in Stu's body. So that's where the hijinks really begin; at least, that was the plan. Once Monkeybone gets back up there, things seem to fall into a familiar plotline, which is a shame. There are many scenes down in the underworld that are positively funny, including Whoopi Goldberg as the Lord of the Dead. Oh, and some good bits with Grim Reaper recruits. And the sets! VERY good, fascinating stuff. If you're a fan of scenes, how things look - set design, set decoration, the whole bit - then this movie has oodles of eye candy. It's very well designed. And here's a bit of praise for someone I thought I'd never give it to: Chris Kattan. See, after Monkeybone returns to Earth in Stu's body, Stu has to find a way back up there himself. He's sent back in the body of a gymnast who was just killed in a car wreck (broken neck). The scenes of Stu waking up on the dissection table then being pursued by a mob of angry pathology doctors anxious to get his organs (which, of course, were supposed to be donated) are priceless, as is the bit of how Stu quickly copes with his broken-neck problem. There's a lot to look at here, and although the characters themselves are rather cardboard (and Fraser himself, while amiable, might be a little miscast), I think this was an overlooked movie. It has everything Cool World had back in 1991, except it also has (pardon the pun) a soul. This one made you like Stu and root for him, which is (of course) essential to any silly comedy. This one's just a silly comedy with some bite to it."}

Once the USSR became a major world power, there was an intense battle of wills on the parts of both the US and Russia not to get into another war. While previous wars had been fought using conventional warfare, it was common knowledge that the next one would involve nuclear weapons, and would probably be the last war anyone would see. In October of 1962, the Soviets planted missiles on the Communist island of Cuba, a mere 90 miles away from Florida's coast. Those of you who were sentient beings in 1962 must have been apoplectic when you heard that news. Imagine! The Red Menace, which had up till then been as distant as Mars, was now parked in your front yard, tooting the horn. It was probably enough to make you quake in your boots. Americans aren't accustomed to reacting in such a manner, of course; we're the big, bad tough guys of the world. And while up till then a full-blown nuclear attack might have seemed as unthinkable as the Cubs winning the World Series, all of a sudden it was very possible. And people were terrified. But by the time the public found out about the missiles, the White House had been working on the problem for a little while. This film captures the inner-circle machinations that President John F. Kennedy and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy orchestrated to avert thermonuclear war. Was Krushchev seriously trying to initiate a war? Was he trying to scare the US? Was he basically saying, \"We can park these missiles right here and there's nothing you can do about it,\" basically making the US look bad to the rest of the world? It was among the most gripping time period's in the brief, eventful history of the United States. The future of not only the country but of the entire world was teetering, and one false move on the part of the level-headed thinkers in America would plunge it into the abyss. To complicate matters, there were two letters purporting to be from the Soviet leader: Were they both fakes? Was the first real, and the second a fraud? Should the US denounce both? And of course, there were certain military leaders in the US who wanted nothing more than to blow the Reds off the planet. The movie is filled with a virtual no-name cast. Bruce Greenwood plays the president, and he was convincing and powerful in his performance. Steven Culp plays Bobby Kennedy, volatile but shrewd, the ultimate diplomat. The only real \"name\" in the cast belongs to Kevin Costner, who plays political advisor Kenny O'Donnell. He has the same good-old-boy accent he sported in JFK, but he was a little more emotional than in most of his films. A good move on his part, I'd say. The madness of near-war is an infection to which these prime players seemed immune. It's movies like this that remind one that politics and war planning are not simple textbook exercises; they need to be cultivated from the heart and leashed by the brain."}

Before I saw this movie, I had visions of Meg Ryan, America's Sweetheart, being kidnapped by terrorists bent on depriving the world of primo coffee. Sadly, though, Meg's not kidnapped. That honor goes to her onscreen hubby, Peter (David Morse), who's working on building a dam (under the direction of the usual Evil Oil Company) somewhere in South America. Local rebels blockade a road and pick up David, and after learning he works for a rich American company, take him hostage.\nCrowe's Terry is called in to talk to the bad guys. He's had a lot of practice doing this, just as Crowe's had a lot of practice playing steely, stoic guys who Do the Right Thing all the time. And just as Ryan's had a lot of practice playing cutie pies. During filming of this movie the two stars had an affair. Remember? I was on the edge of my seat for several minutes as I waited for the next engrossing episode of Meg n' Russ. But I digress.\nWhile Peter's held captive, he's tortured a little. He's deprived of food, water, etc. Oh, and he's mocked incessantly in Spanish by the Number One Bad Guy. I almost expected the Number One Bad Guy to reveal his evil plans, but I was disappointed on that front. But the torture Peter suffers is nothing compared to the endurance required for the viewer to watch Crowe and Ryan attempt to act. Movies like this only prove that Meg Ryan is incapable of acting in movies that do not showcase her \"cute\" image. Put her in Sleepless in Seattle, and the country falls in love with her. Put her in a movie with a more serious plot, and she's just ballast.\nAdded to Ryan's incapabilities was the one-note performance by Pamela Reed as Peter's sister. I can't blame Reed entirely for her abrasive performance, however; like that of Lorraine Bracco in Medicine Man, the annoying aspect of the character comes at least as much from the screenwriters as it does from the rather constipated performance.\nBack in the early 1980s, the movie Missing covered some of the same territory, although without a negotiator. In it, Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek search for their son and husband (respectively) who is feared to be kidnapped. The characters have never liked each other, being polar opposites on many issues. Yes, their characters found a way to work together to reach the same goal, but it wasn't a clean, perfect working relationship, either. The characters grew during the course of the film. That's good writing. Here, the predictable happens, some of it terribly ludicrous. Here are some facts: Peter is in captivity for over 120 days (as evidenced by messages of \"120 days\" and such on screen). Ryan's Alice tries any way possible to get him back (her husband's company won't help, with no kidnapping insurance!), and eventually \"settles\" for Crowe (why is it that the hero is always The Last Hope?). But even though Alice wants Peter back.... Well, I won't give anything away, but let's say her actions are not congruent with that logic at all.\nWhile Terry is stoic and an all-around get-the-job-done kind of guy, he's not terribly exciting, either. Sure, you argue, but he doesn't have to be. He's so cool that he can just sit back and think things through. But hey, this guy never even raises his voice, let alone lose his temper. Which is great if you're looking for a methodical accountant, but an action hero? And don't tell me he's not supposed to be an action hero - stuff gets blown up. That not only screams \"action movie\" to me, it wears an \"action movie\" hat with a t-shirt that says \"Kiss me, I'm an action movie\". Let's not pussyfoot around here, folks. This is an action movie with a librarian as its hero.\n\n\"Oh,\" you say, \"but it's ok. He just looks so damn fine! I don't care about his actions, I just wanna see that smouldering hunka hunka burning love!\" Oh, he smoulders, all right. But you know those forest fires that burn below the ground, where you only see smoke coming from the earth? He's like that. And you know what? I'll look at those fires on The Weather Channel, then quickly pass on by. Smoke is smoke, but flames are an interesting thing to watch.\nThis is a junky film. But I will say this - David Caruso, late of NYPD Blue and a failed movie career, is aces as Terry's comrade in arms, Dino. Way to go, David! But everyone else? Ick. Hope they don't need to put this on a resume."}

I feel secure enough in my maleness to say that. In fact, I can say it with pride. He's one DAMN fine man! Woooooo hooooooo!   Oops, got carried away there. But it just goes to show you that even we devoutly heterosexual guys realize he's kinda hot. And that's important for this film to work. Mel plays Nick, an incredibly sexist, egotistical, arrogant, womanizing ad-agency executive. He's the kind of guy who guys want to be and who women want to have. This might explain his popularity a little. Nick's all set to get the big promotion he feels he deserves - to Creative Director of his ad agency. His boss and mentor Dan (Alan Alda) calls him into his office for a talk. Nick's all ready for the big news. Can't wait for the corner office on the 44th floor. And then Dan drops the bombshell on poor Nick. Not only isn't he getting the promotion, Dan's hired someone else to take the job! And not only that, it's a woman! So now our poor spoiled boy - who has seen women as either sex objects or hired help, and sometimes both - has to report directly to a woman. Oh, poor, poor Nick. Yes, I can practically hear you ladies out there, just oozing with empathy for this lost soul. A fine comeuppance, you're thinking. He's getting what he deserves, you think. His new boss, Darcy (Helen Hunt), in her first staff meeting, hands out kits to each of the ad people that contain \"feminine\" products (such as lipstick, padded bras, eyeliner, stockings, and, of course, wax). She wants the company to start paying more attention to the female consumer, noting that billions of dollars were spent by females the previous year, and none of that cash went to their company. So Nick takes the stuff home and, drunk on wine, tries it all on. Has to keep his job, you know. And minutes later, a freak electrical accident involving a bathtub and a hair dryer leaves Nick with the most dubious of gifts: the ability to read the minds of women. Hmm. I don't know about my fellow males, but I'm not sure I want to read the minds of women. As if reading their minds would help me understand anything! But poor, poor Nick. He hears EVERYTHING women (even a female poodle) are thinking, with the predicted madcap hilarity. But it's spooky for our favorite chauvinist. What's he to do? Well, he IS a chauvinist. So he uses his newfound ability to steal Darcy's ideas and present them as his own! What a guy! The movie wouldn't be all that wondeful with only one plot going on around Nick, so we get the added pleasure of him having to \"watch\" his 15-year-old daughter while his ex-wife is on her honeymoon, of him dealing with a semisweet, semipsychotic coffeehouse babe, of him dealing with a mousy coworker/underling. It's all presented to make Nick's life look chaotic, although there are few people who wouldn't trade places with him in general (except for that mind-reading thing). I mean, let's face it. He's attractive to women, has money, and... well, what else is there, really? So how does this comedy of telepathy end? It's not unpredictable. Knowing that Nick is stealing Darcy's ideas, how do you think he'd resolve his situation? And knowing the peripheral plots, how do you think he'll tie them all together?   Because of Gibson's seemingly endless charm (like Cary Grant, he can simply grin sheepishly and win hearts), this movie stays afloat. He has a capable, if not distinguishable, supporting cast. Oh, and check out the six-pack old Mel's sporting. That's what the good life can get you: a personal trainer and a lifetime supply of Tae-Bo tapes."}

It was said to be a masterpiece, compelling, with luscious scenes and magnificent cinematography. \"Goodie,\" I thought. \"I can't wait to see it on video.\" Well, it's here. And I have just finished watching it. Those of you who have known me or who have been on this list for a while know my feelings about foreign films in general. I usually don't like to read subtitles, because it detracts from my enjoyment of the film. When I learned that this movie was dubbed, I was more interested, because I did not wish to be distracted from the striking visual scenes.\n However, the problem is that the movie's not terribly good. One major knock against Hollywood films - and a justly earned knock, too - is that more attention is paid to the special effects of a film than to the story. Well, newsflash - that knock applies to some foreign-made films as well. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a delight, as long as you don't pay attention to such trivialities as plot or character development.   Remember those old martial-arts films with Bruce Lee (and even the newer ones with Jackie Chan) that featured hilariously bad dubbing? Those movies were infamous for their dubbing. The tradition continues! That's one strike against the film. Oh sure, you must be thinking, of course the dubbing doesn't seem as flawless as it would be if the actors were using their natural voices. That's to be expected. But it wasn't that the dubbing didn't match up with the facial expressions of the actors, it was that the readings were absolutely soulless. The readings are usually terrible! And when they're not flat and uninspiring, they're overly dramatic. If this was a purely American enterprise, people would have hooted at it. The plot concerns the disappearance of a mystical jade sword, owned by the great warrior Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat). Li decides to give his sword to an old friend, but the sword is soon stolen by a mysterious assassin and her protege. Soon the protege has the sword, Li is fighting everyone in sight, people die, and there's a lot of mysticism. I might be oversimplifying the plot a little, but considering how needlessly complicated the plot is to begin with, I think I'm doing you all a favor in that regard! It is certainly true that the action scenes are unbelievable. You've all doubtless seen the commercials where one attacker walks up the side of a building. That's only the first trick to come out of the bag. As a martial arts film, this is a Picasso. But for those of us who prefer multilayered movies, ones featuring more than just a smattering of nominal plot devices, this is fingerpainting more suitable for a refrigerator."}

Nowadays, however, kids aren't as gullible. So for the past few years, studios - including but not limited to Disney - have come out with some very cool movies that have appealed to both children and adults. Toy Story was a pioneer in this field, although it's not the only one. Follow the evolution to Antz and A Bug's Life, and finally you come to the present masterpiece, Shrek. Shrek is a giant green ogre (voiced marvelously by Mike Myers) who lives alone in a swamp. Every now and again the people from a nearby village try to oust him (shades of Frankenstein!), but he scares 'em away right proper. But unbeknownst to Shrek, the evil Lord Farquaad (don't read it too quickly in front of kids!) has banished all \"fairy tale creatures\" from the forest and placed them on Shrek's swamp. Imagine his surprise! (The creatures include knock-offs of Pinocchio, the three pigs, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and so on.) And to add insult to his further injury, a charmed, talking donkey named Donkey (voiced by the inestimable Eddie Murphy) wants to be Shrek's pal. To get the creatures off his land, Shrek goes to the source of the trouble - Farquaad (John Lithgow). The evil one, after Shrek beats the beejezus out of all the lord's knights, tells Shrek he will get rid of the fairy tale creatures if the ogre will go on a quest for him. The quest, it turns out, consists of Shrek journeying to a far-off castle and rescuing a fair princess (Cameron Diaz). Oh yes, and slaying a dragon, too, to get to her. Does this sound like the typical kids' film so far? And of course, Donkey must tag along. One of the best trends in recent yeards regarding these animated movies is that when producers get celebrities to voice characters, they give the celebrities free reign to improvise a little. Murphy is hilarious, audacious, and absolutely riotous as Donkey. He easily steals every scene he's in, which is most of them. Murphy's as funny here as Robin Williams was in the original Aladdin, a wild, untamed bundle of energy and raucous humor. He drops a couple of mild double-entendres and the requisite flatulence jokes and a whole bunch of pop culture references. Lithgow is wonderfully sneering as the short-statured lord, both despotic and self-serving, but one of those Snidely Whiplash-type characters who always seem to be muttering under their breath, \"Curses! Foiled again!\" Diaz has a lovely voice, tenuous when it should be, strong and mighty when it should be. But it's Myers as the humble and yet garrulous Shrek who's running things here. He's at times petulant, antisocial, and moody, but also courageous and very knightly indeed. There are some who have quibbled about Myers' using a Scottish accent for Shrek, but according to reports the actor (who's from Canada) was originally supposed to do a Canadian accent. Personally, I think the Scottish one's a lot better. This is great whiz-bang fun, and the in-jokes never let up. Watch it all the way through!"}

And with them as always is Evelyn's brother Jonathan (John Hanna), who acts as the film's Comic Relief. But there's a newcomer: the 8-year-old son of Rick and Evelyn, Alex (Freddie Boath). The gang's brought back into more hair-raising experiences when a dig unearths a rather cool-looking chest that contains a sacred bracelet. Naturally, once the family gets back home to London, the first thing the little imp Alex wants to do is open it. And put the bracelet on. \nTurns out that whoever wears the bracelet is shown a series of famous pyramids, and only by going to each one in succession can he or she know what the next destination is. What's the point, you ask? Well, at the end of this whole thing our old buddy Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) is gonna defeat the Scorpion King (Dwayne Johnson) and take the king's army and conquer the world. I know, it sounds like Steven Somers (who wrote and directed) has been reading too many comic books. But this is the kind of movie that you don't examine too closely, at least not the plot.  The point is simply that there's an adventure afoot, and it's up to Our Hero to save the day.\nRick, Evelyn, Jonathan, and Alex, joined by Ardeth Bay, the protectorate from the first film, encounter a series of mind-boggling special effects, all wonderfully done on someone's computer. Hey, don't get me wrong, they look real neat, like that giant waterfall and those freaky pygmy skeletons. The problem is that they're all stolen from other movies! The waterfall is a simple ripoff of the last Mummy movie, and the skeletons look a lot like the little demons in Gremlins. \nOne fatal mistake the movie makes is in introducing the typical Annoying Little Kid. This is what singlehandedly sunk another wonderful movie, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1989) had a then-very-young Sarah Polley, and this one has the aforementioned Freddie Boath. Both actors speak with a thick Cockney accent and both have a tendency to get into mischief. But you know that all credibility is tossed kicking and screaming out the window when, in the very first scene, Rick and Evelyn bring little Alex to a spooky temple in their search for this chest, and wouldn't ya know it, they leave HIM out by the entrance. \"Stay here,\" they tell him. What kind of a parent brings their kid to a place like that? Ok, ok, I know it's a movie, but there was simply no reason to have this kid in the movie. He may be a good actor, but the character was unnecessary, unwieldy, and unlikeable. He was also a bit like young Anakin Skywalker from Star Wars, only not as cool. Now Alex had a few good lines and generally acquitted himself nicely, but he was more of a liability than an asset. If anyone should have played the role of buffoon and put the bracelet on (thus incurring all sorts of supernatural wrath), it should have been Jonathan, who was a wonderful surprise from the first. But alas, as is sometimes the case with casting people, they fall in love with cute little kids. Bah!\nDon't make the mistake I made and overexamine the movie. I saw some really dumb things, but most of them are inconsequential. There's one I'd like to point out, however: Rick, Jonathan, Ardeth, and Alex are running from the front of the outside of their house around to the side, where their car is. They RUN around the corner, and then the next shot shows them slowing down to a slow walk. Why? So they can discuss what's happened, what they're going to do, and so forth. Never mind that Evelyn's been kidnapped. Never mind that they were all frantic not 1 second ago, and suddenly when they go around the corner, they have time to chat? Sheesh! Such stupidity! Such bad editing!\nThis very poor man's Indiana Jones isn't terribly inventive, even in its special effects, but it still is roundly entertaining. You could do far worse for two and a half hours."}

(Salinger published the English-class standard Catcher in the Rye way back when, and has done little since, choosing the life of a hermit instead.) He lives in a tenement building in the Bronx in New York, always peering out from his small apartment at the pickup basketball games below.   One of the kids who plays in those games near Forrester's apartment is Jamal Wallace (Robert Brown), a talented high schooler who carries a C average. Well, \"carries\" is the right word, because Jamal is apparently a lot smarter than his grades would indicate; he's well-read and articulate. But having great grades in an inner-city school is apparently not cool, so Jamal holds back.   So the boys playing their games see Forrester watching them, and they make up stories about the place - it's the domain of a ghost, of course. And on a dare, Jamal climbs up the side of the building to check out the mysterious ghost - and winds up leaving his bag. Naturally, Forrester goes through the bag and reads Jamal's latest compositions and marks them all up. And that's how the two meet - Jamal comes back after getting his bag tossed down at him and seeing the critical comments from Forrester, and they strike a deal: Forrester will help the young lad with his writing, and Jamal won't mention Forrester's identity to anyone. Jamal, on the advice of school counselors, begins to attend a private college (on a scholarship, of course), and he runs into Professor Crawford (F. Murray Abraham). Anyone who's attended college has had a teacher like this - pompous, arrogant, snooty. And of course, since Forrester is acting as Jamal's muse, problems ensue about that oldest of college problems - plagiarism, not alcoholism.   Will the recluse stand up for his friend and leave his apartment building? Will Jamal be vindicated? Will Jamal help the school win the basketball championship? Geez, all this film was missing was a sick mother or a wisecracking best friend. Oh wait - we DID have the best friend, played (and played very well) by Busta Rhymes.   This movie is absolutely exploding with cliches, and most of the characters seem to be one-dimensional. But it's Brown who stands above everyone else, who makes this more than just another mentor-student movie. His timing is impeccable, his delivery astonishing, and his talents should - repeat, should - take him miles from this movie. He's so good he makes even Connery look like just another old fart, but I think Connery mailed this one in. Even so, his character is too coarse to be interesting, and I wound up not giving a rat's ass about him. Unfortunately, his situation is supposed to be one of the driving forces of the movie."}

Billy's father is headstrong and medieval in his worldly outlook, as he only wants manly things for his son. But Billy sees something more in the poetry of ballet, and he wants more than anything else to be as fluid and graceful as those sinewy dancers.   Having established the conflict of the story from the outset, the movie takes us through Billy's struggles to complete his ballet training privately (under the tutelage of Mrs. Wilkinson, played by Julie Walters). It's a great idea for a movie, really, because of the stark contrast between the outside world of Billy's neighborhood (which exists under the spectre of an ominous protracted workers' strike, of which Billy's father participates) and the inner workings of Billy's decidedly unmanly mind.\n However, the film is hit or miss. If the viewer allows himself or herself to become fully wrapped up in Billy's predicament, much as one would approach a soap opera, then one will fall for this unabashed schmaltz-fest with no problems. But for the more cynical among us, the movie fails in that it plays out virtually every Hollywood cliche imaginable; the only true original notion in the movie is the basic \"boy wants to be a ballet dancer\" ideal. Here are some tried-and-true portions of the movie: Boy wants to do something against dad's wishes. Boy's dad is a tough-as-nails cretin, stolidly stupid but somewhere, deep inside, he loves his boy. Then there's the unforgiving teacher (Mr. Miyagi, anyone?). And the Impossible Dream. The list goes on and one. When I first popped this in the ol' DVD player, I accidentally set it to play in French (at least I think that's what that was...) Then I stopped it and switched the settings. Guess what? The overwrought Cockney accents are, at times, absolutely indecipherable. It's like watching a foreign film, only not as full of deep meaning.   In short, this can be a real snorefest if you're not ready to become one with the plight of poor Master Elliot. If you are, more power to you; time for you to dust off that old copy of Love Story. But if you're like the rest of us, skip it unless you're suffering from sleep deprivation."}

Imagine the slight! You've worked extra-special hard at your job for so long, preparing for a Great Big Important Job, only to have your promised position handed over to a monkey! You can see why Frank might be a tad upset over this.\nMore than 40 years later, the boys are long in the tooth and are doing just about anything but working for NASA. Frank's enjoying retirement. Hawk is a cropdusting pilot. Jerry designs roller coasters. And Tank's an ordained minister. Ah, but NASA needs them! Seems Russia has this old satellite orbiting Earth that's going to fall to terra firma in about a month. And since it's such an old beast, it has design plans that came from Skylab - which, conveniently, Frank designed. And, also conveniently, he's the only one who can fix this satellite and bring it in safely, rather than have it crash to Earth. (Apparently, that would be bad. Don't ask why.)\nBob Gerson reluctantly asks his old nemesis Frank to help him out, and Frank says he'll fix the problem - but only if he can go up. Oh, and his team. Gerson agrees, and the Daedulus team - Frank, Hawk, Tank, and Jerry - train for their mission. Did I mention they're really, really old? So you get your share of Ensure jokes and false-teeth hee-haws. Granted, it's a one-joke premise, but it's such a darn good one.\nAnd the characters are fun, too. Hawk's a devil-may-care tough guy, a persona Tommy Lee Jones has played many, many times. Frank's a cranky old man, cantankerous and crotchety ,but a true leader. Jerry's a womanizer - and my goodness, he's gotta be over 70. Only the character of Tank seems a little less detailed than his compatriots, although I'm not sure if this is just slacker writing or an intention of the screenwriter.\nThe plot is a little predictable, and if you've seen any movies over the past 20 years or so, you'll recognize a lot of twists before they become twists. See Armageddon, Deep Impact, Mission to Mars, and Red Planet for some ideas - or go into this one a little fresher, with wide-open eyes.\nEither way, you'll be entertained. The four leads in this movie are a LOT of fun to watch, and if you've followed their careers at all, it's a hoot to see how the actors have evolved since their early days. They have gone from iconoclasts of society to plaster icons (a phrase that was once used to describe The Beatles, only in reverse). Sutherland played a lot of rebellious sorts during the turbulent 1960s-1970s, and had achieved leading-man status by the time Klute came out in 1974; now he plays authority figures, such as in JFK and The Puppet Masters. Eastwood got his start with spaghetti Westerns, then shot to the bigger time as Dirty Harry - but he remains a tough guy, doesn't he? Revered by society, but he still looks like he doesn't give a damn. Garner went from Maverick and innocuous Doris Day movies to the tough but urbane stylings of Jim Rockford; now he plays dignified, intelligent characters. And Tommy Lee? Ok, so he's still the barnstorming, hell-raising fool he's always been. I didn't even think he was old enough to be in this movie, although he sure had me convinced by the time the film was over.\nIn short, good solid fun."}

Touche, mon frere.\nAll would be wonderful if Leo could just go straight, but those things never work out that way. Hey, Michael Corleone couldn't go straight in Godfather III, so why should this loser? He'll be good, he promises. He'll get a job at the railroad station with his uncle Frank (James Caan). Only that doesn't quite work out, either; his old pal Willie (Joaquin Phoenix, wooden as always) wants him to work with HIM in the railroad yards.

The boys from the old neighborhood, those knockabout  toughs of yore, involve Leo in bad things. The funny thing is, Wahlberg plays him as this innocent naif who seems as clueless as Little Orphan Annie might have been in the same situation. There are times when he appears crime-savvy, but for the most part, a wide-eyed state, mouth agape, is the character's trademark.\nWahlberg seems to be sleepwalking through this escapade, and his supporting cast - strong as it is on paper - is no better. Burstyn has a thankless dying-mom role; Faye Dunaway plays her sister. You'd be hard-pressed to see a lot of life from either actress. Caan is becoming more of a caricature of his old-time tough-guy self; he's still fun to watch, but his performane is a little too one-note for me. And we also have Charlize Theron as Willie's fiance. Could someone please tell me WHY this young lady took this role? She looks horrid, and the role's not nearly meaty enough for her to enjoy. In short, anyone in the world could have performed the character, and Theron herself didn't add anything to it.\nWith that tremendous cast, and with a small amount of hype involved, I expected a far better film. This one is moody, somnabulent, and dull; a vapid pastiche of overwrought and underwhelming performances."}

At present, he's a shambling, shifty, scruffy, sloppy, disheveled college professor in the field of creative writing. In the morning, his wife leaves him. \"I lost a wife today,\" he later tells his agent Crabtree (Robert Downey, Jr.). To which Crabtree responds, \"You'll find another. You always do.\"\nGrady has a student living at his house (she was there before the wife left, so yes, it's platonic). Another student, James Lear (the ineffectual Tobey Maguire) is obsessed with death and can recite in alphabetical order the names of famous celebrity suicides. Then there's Grady's mistress, the chancellor of the college (Frances McDormand). Oh, and there's a blind dog who hates Grady, too. And a transvestite. And so it goes.\nAnyone who's ever written something, whether they've been assigned to do so or just want to do it of their own volition, has at sometime or another had a problem getting started. With this review, in fact, I didn't know where to begin. Once you get started, you're ok. Well, Grady's problem is quite the opposite. He has a different kind of writer's block, you see. He has diarrhea of the mind. He's been working on this book for five years. He has accumulated over 2,000 pages. \"The ending keeps getting further and further away,\" he says in voice-over narration. Grady can't seem to finish his novel not because he can't figure out what to write but because he can't stop writing.\nHis agent, Crabtree, is in dire straits. Grady's all he has left, and in New York the other literary agents laugh at him. He comes to Grady's school during Word Week, an English Department-sponsored gathering designed to be a way for some of the brighter writers to sell their works to attending agents. Crabtree is a well-developed figure, too, and it seems to me that Downey Jr. was probably the wisest choice to play him. Downey Jr. turns in a magnificent, understated performance that's the backbone of the film.\nMaguire, as the critical character James, takes underplaying to a new level. He delivers his line in an almost-catatonic, droll monotone. Granted, there are several scenes in which this makes sense, but not all the time. Maguire's mannerisms are as deep as a puddle, and this is nothing new for the so-called wunderkind. I saw him in Pleasantville and The Cider House Rules, to name a couple, and in neither was he more than mildly interesting. With that in mind, I was not disappointed in his work here.\nMcDormand is excellent in her brief scenes as the chancellor. She's assuredly one of the best actresses working today, as her work here and in Almost Famous attests. She's strong, iron-willed, charming, angry, petulant,and loving. A perfect foil for Douglas' Grady.\n\nAnd Douglas himself is a lot of fun. He's so much the victim in here, but so much is also his own doing. He's not a bad guy, and he tries his hardest to make things right, but as happens so often with guys in movies, what he tries fails, and what he doesn't try haunts him."}

Also hanging around outside, trying to get in, are some very young groupies - ahem, friends of the band - who call themselves Band Aids; their exuberant leader is Penny Lane (Oscar-nominated Kate Hudson).\nThrough quick wits and a sharp mind, William gains access to the band. He doesn't interview anyone from Black Sabbath, but gets to talk to - and eventually befriend - the opening act, Stillwater. And thus William's odyssey begins; his writings catch the eye of an editor at Rolling Stone, and William is assigned the task of doing a full article on Stillwater. Naturally, the band likes him - he's so wide-eyed and innocent, after all, and not as sharklike as many other music journalists - and they take him along. William immediately breaks the first rule of rock journalism - don't be friends with the band.\nThe story is one long coming-of-age-tale for William. His eyes are open, but so is his mind. He is not just some dumb kid who lucks into the spoils of rockdom - he comes off as a serious, but not too serious, kid with a crackerjack brain and unyielding, newfound emotions. \nIt's hard to say who comes off best in this movie. Is it Hudson, who manages to play vampish, slutty, sincere, honest, and mysterious all at once, and convincingly? Is it Frances McDormand, also Oscar-nominated, who's a tower of strength as William's doting mom? How about Crowe's Oscar-winning script? There's nary a hole in it, and it's so rich with detail and life of seventies culture that if you had been there before, you were there again, and if you weren't there then, you're there now. But it's not soaked with so much detail that it's a story unto itself - too many movies are based on atmosphere. This one has the atmosphere, but it acts as a background, not as a character.\nThe movie is charming, bittersweet, delicious, and absolutely delightful. Great fun all the way, and some great music, too!"}

When the vice-president dies or is otherwise unable to serve his office, the president picks someone to replace him, and that person is then confirmed by a Congressional committee. Kind of like the confirmation hearings for secretary of state, secretary of agriculture, secretary of commerce, and so on. \nThe frontrunner for the position here is Governor Jack Hathaway (William L. Petersen), a nice guy/career politico who is viewed as a hero by many when he dives into a lake in an attempt to save a young girl from drowning when her car goes over a bridge. The girl dies, but Hathaway's popularity increases due to the \"hero\" factor. However, President Evans and Kermit Newman (Sam Elliott), his counsel, don't want \"another Chappaquiddick,\" so they take the governor off the list.\nThey instead turn to Laine Hanson (Joan Allen, nominated for Best Actress), but when they announce Laine as the president's choice, a secret from her past comes to the surface. It's widely reported on the Internet that Laine engaged in sexual misconduct during her early years at Harvard University. Laine does not confirm or deny the charges; she steadfastly refuses to comment on them.\nThe thing about politicians and their images is that we Americans care less about such scandals as stocks, money laundering, and mild bribery than we do about sex scandals. Nothing kills a campaign or hopes of a career in Washington faster than a sex scandal, and it's even worse when the politician is female.\nLaine consistently refuses to discuss the charges, either with the president, his counsel, the press, or, most importantly, the committee running the confirmation hearings. These hearings are chaired by Shelley Runyon (Gary Oldman, almost unrecognizable but brilliant), who wants to make the president's term end on a bad note, to make sure his place in history isn't a noble one. Runyon runs the hearings like, as his wife puts it, sort of a low-rent Joe McCarthy. Of course, during these kinds of hearings, anything goes - most of all, private lives.\nHanson sticks to her story. I won't give anything else away here, but I will tell you that this is a story or principles and dignity. It is a tale of honor among thieves, to be precise; for who among us feels that there is an overwhelming amount of honor among politicians? Hanson's mantra throughout the proceedings is \"It is beneath my dignity to answer those charges.\" This is unheard  of in real life. In real life, we'd want her to answer for herself. Well, Laine doesn't want to answer for herself. So it's a stalemate. Everyone wants to know if the charges are true for two reasons: for the purpose of knowing whether the good Senator Hanson is worthy of the office of the vice-president and for their own sexual curiosity. Could she have done those things? \nPraise should be heaped on the participants in this treat. What a cast! Bridges is tough and feisty as the president, and Allen is simply amazing as Hanson. Christian Slater has a telling role as a junior senator on the confirmation committee, but he's not terribly good. But Elliot's wonderful, as is Petersen.\nI would not be surprised if Joan Allen were to win the Best Actress Oscar this year. This is her third nomination, following Nixon (1995) and The Crucible (1996). Bridges has a good chance, too; this is his fourth nomination, following Starman (1984), Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974), and The Last Picture Show (1971)."}

A somewhat corrupt Mexican cop undergoes a series of crises of conscience. A woman watches as her husband is taken away by the police on charges of drug smuggling. A 16-year-old golden child dabbles in soft and hard drugs.\nSee the theme? Steven Soderbergh's Traffic is an odyssey painted on a wide canvas, as the general theme of drugs is expressed in how drugs are produced, how they arrive in the United States from Mexico, how they are bought, who buys them, and what happens to some who use them. It is not a preachy film, however, and that's one of the reasons this movie works.\nMichael Douglas plays the new drug czar, and his mission is to win the war on drugs. But how to win such a war? And is it even winnable? This has never been an issue with easy solutions, and Soderbergh is smart enough not to give us a mythical cure-all. Wakefield (Douglas) is a convinced, honest man who wants to do the right thing - but even with his judicial experience, he has no idea how to proceed. His job is, in some ways, devoid of actual meaning. He is a figurehead, a symbol to the people that stands for Something Being Done on behalf of the government to stop the growing drug problem.\nWakefield wants to bring down the two biggest cartels in Mexico, both of which are smuggling drugs into the U.S. on a magnificent scale. On the Mexican side, a policeman named Javier (Benicio del Toro) first turns a blind eye to the corruption and smuggling, since the cartels are being fought (somewhat offhandedly) by General Salazar, a despot in the making. Javier is recruited by Salazar to join his task force dedicated to eradicating the cartels, and we're given a close glimpse at how such \"task forces\" operate. Javier, like Wakefield, is a very conflicted man. Corruption is prevalent in the Mexican police force, according to the movie, but when it comes to more serious crimes, Javier is not sure what to do. \n\nAna (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is the wife of a wealthy businessman (Steven Bauer). When her husband is arrested under suspicion of drug smuggling, Ana must learn how to cope - her neighbors and friends want nothing to do with her, and only one trusted confidant (Dennis Quaid) seems to be on her side. But whose side is Ana on?\nWakefield's young daughter, a National Merit Scholar finalist and class brain, is rapidly becoming an addict to serious drugs. Her friends are also addicts, and when they get together it's a lot like those old existentialist/philosophical discussions that old-time hippies used to have - only without the profundity. These kids are as deep as a puddle.\n\nThis beautifully crafted film brings all of these characters together in some way or another - they're not always in scenes together, but what one character does might affect another character's actions. And, of course, the underlying moral issue of what to do about the drug problem appears throughout, no matter if the setting is rural Mexico or San Diego, California. \nThe cinematography of a film is hardly ever what draws people to watch a movie, but it should be noted that this movie does some interesting things with the camera. For example, all of the shots in Mexico are in a grainy yellowish filter, while the U.S. shots are clear and nonfiltered. This might be to symbolize the differences in economic viability, or it could be that Soderbergh simply wanted to make sure people knew each scene's setting.\n\nAs for the performances themselves, Douglas is aces as the drug czar (a demotion from president, which he played in The American President), and Zeta-Jones is fine as the victimized Ana. But it's the Oscar-nominated del Toro who's wonderful as the complex Javier, and he stands a good chance of taking home the statue.\nThe movie itself was nominated for Best Picture (and Soderbergh earned a directing nod, too), and deservedly so. It's two-and-a-half hours long, though, so don't make the same mistake I did and get to the theater late. I had to sit in the first row for 144 minutes. Not fun. My spine telescoped."}

In the Beatty version, the protagonist was a backup quarterback for the then-Los Angeles Rams. In Rock's hipper version, our lead character is a struggling young - and decidedly low-talent - standup comedian.\nIt's very funny to see the razor-sharp Rock playing a bad comedian. It's kind of like seeing Tom Hanks play a bad actor. Lance Barton's dream is to play the legendary Apollo Theater on a non-amateur night. But every time he tries out his material, he's booed off the stage lustily - so much so that his nickname becomes \"Booie.\" His jokes are lame, his delivery painful. In short, Lance is everything that the real Chris Rock isn't.\n\nLance is also a bike messenger, and he's riding the streets on his way to try out even more material when BAM! He's hit by a truck. Ok, so maybe he was taken from his body a tenth of a second early by a slightly incompetent angel (Eugene Levy), but hey, he was going to get hit anyway. No dice, it appears Lance isn't due in Heaven until 2044. So what to do? Mr. King (Chazz Palminteri), the \"manager\" of Heaven, reluctantly agrees to find a new body for the not-quite-dead Mr. Barton. Trouble is, the body they find is of a greedy, old white man. Turns out this fella (a Mr. Wellington) owns all kinds of things - he's the 15th richest man in the country! What luck! You can imagine how Lance will turn things around. \nBut of course, while in the body of the affluent Mr. Wellington, Lance falls for a gorgeous hospital worker (Regina King). We males know how tough it is to find a female given our own body, but try winning one over while you're an dumpy, old white guy! And it's even worse when she's not impressed by your money.  \nThis is Rock's first shot at a lead role, and in my opinion he performs admirably. There's still a lot of the standup comedian in him - and, of course, if he ever wants to get diverse roles, he might have to stop incorporating standup routines into the script - but this isn't really a bad thing. Rock's personality - his drive, his delivery, his demeanor, and his passion - are what fuel this film. He's clearly having a lot of fun in the role, and he seems bent on making sure you have fun watching him."}

Eats me..", "content": "After nine years of waiting, finally the sequel to The Silence of the Lambs is upon us, descending for the masses to devour. The director this time is Ridley Scott, the Moses bringing to us this feast of horror that updates the characters of Special FBI Agent Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter. Gone is Silence director Jonathan Demme and screenwriter Ted Tally and star Jodie Foster, all of whom passed on this adaptation of Thomas Harris' book. Some had better things to do, some objected to the violence in the book-sequel. In any event, the fact that these principles passed is no small item.   Julianne Moore takes on the role of Starling, the then-rookie FBI agent who worked with the serial killer Lecter to trap another killer, named Buffalo Bill. When Hannibal begins, Starling is disgraced in a botched raid and is suspended by her idiot supervisers. Stop me if you've seen this before: Dedicated law-enforcement official plays by the rules and is blamed when someone else ignores their orders. Yep, it's a cliche. While Starling is suspended, she slowly becomes re-involved in the Lecter case, which ended in the last movie with him on a plane to who-knows-where. What's he been up to all these years?   There aren't nearly as many twists and turns in Hannibal as there were in Silence of the Lambs. Oh sure, you might say, but you can't hold up the sequel to the standards of the original. Not entirely, true, but I also can't completely disregard the original, since the sequel plays off it so often.   By now you've heard about the gore factor. By now, some of your friends might have told you what makes the movie so disgustingly gory. I won't go into that here, though, just in case you haven't heard. But I will say this: the gore you see isn't particularly scary, just gross. There's a big difference, and sadly the screenwriters couldn't see it. In the original, and in many truly scary movies, the anticipation was scarier than the reality. You can show me a bloody corpse, sure, but show me our protagonist walking up to that corpse's sarcophagus, step by stealthy step, with no music, just the sounds of her feet on the stones... and I'm scared to death. Silence did this; Hannibal does not. Moore herself is a liability here, too. Sure, any actress would love this role. And sure, if you asked her, Moore would say she didn't think she was replacing Foster, that she doesn't feel the pressure of following an Oscar-winning performance. That's hogwash, of course. And while Foster brought a sort of smoldering naivete to the role, curious but intelligent, solid but wavering in her own humanity, Moore cannot. It's not her fault entirely, though. The character is about as deep as a puddle. She's not surrounded by the finest characters, either. Yes, Anthony Hopkins is great; he should be, it's his role. But Ray Liotta as Starling's RBI tormentor was way, way, way over the top. Remember that disgrace I wrote about earlier? Guess which character plays it off so that Starling's the screwup? Yes, Liotta's Paul. Why? I don't know. Something about Your Bosses Never Believe You - and it looks as if that goes double if you're a female. Never mind if you've put in 10 years as a straight-arrow agent; apparently, even if you do things by the book you're wrong. Goodbye, Father Logic! And the movie is so SLOW! Sometimes it's a good idea to have slow moments, kind of like the anticipation moments in Silence. But this slowness wasn't leading up to anything! There are just minutes of deadening silence in which nothing happens. There was enough boredom in this movie to put an entire preschool of hyperactive kids to sleep for a year. Chess matches had more action.   Silence had both horror and action. It had a robust plot supported by phenomenal performances. Hannibal has an interesting story, but it had at least one superfluous plot. It had no action and very little horror - and that horror was practically spelled out to you before it got there! Scott appears to have no idea how to stage a horror/action film - he was either moving things along incongruosly and incoherently, or he brought them to an immediate inexplicable standstill. Every ounce of excitement that had existed in Silence was completely evaporated. For a movie with such a nice budget and all the backing in the world (not to mention all the great word-of-mouth anticipation), this should have been at least a decent movie. I came out of the theater feeling cheated and underwhelmed."}

Sure, it appears to be a lame knockoff/parody of such allegedly hip slasher movies as Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. Oh, and sure, we just had one of those parody films (Scary Movie). Are you sick of this genre yet? Well get unsick. This one's a keeper.\nWith a virtually unknown cast and with the whole self-referential, self-absorbed, self-aggrandizing horror movie genre being so far overdone as to render satire ineffective, this movie had very little going for it from the outset. Its title seems more of a ripoff than a well-considered parody. But the title belies a wonderful product.\nI really didn't expect much here, maybe a few laughs to help me scrape through the day. I expected a real dumb comedy, one with jokes about as subtle as a sledgehammer. But this one is more in the vein of the early Airplane! movies - it is rife with both verbal and sight gags, some of which are throwaways. The movie seems to relish its stereotypes, but mockingly.\n\nOne of the great things about the original Airplane! is that there were so many gags going on in the background that you sometimes found yourself paying attention to the peripheral stuff and ignoring some of the actual plot. The writers of that movie knew you'd do that, and they made the central plot rather dull - airplane in danger, must be landed - and allowed the characters to play off their lines as complete straight men. This movie does the same kind of thing, and there are tons and tons of inside and subtle jokes that you might not see right off the bat - and when you do, you'll laugh your ass off.\nThe basic story is that there are murders going on in a high school (\"The Spring Break Massacre,\" the papers call it), five friends are united both by these murders and something they did the previous year (which they all remember differently), and an intrepid reporter who tries everything to get the scoop on the whole thing.\nThis is real parody. It's a great escapist movie, a lot of fun if you sat through any of the self-indulgent crap that was the Scream trilogy. This one never lets you take it seriously. It's a fun ride all the way."}

The story centers around Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst, all grown up from Interview with the Vampire), who is named as captain of the squad at the outset of the movie, displacing the outgoing, aggressive Big Red (Lindsey Sloane).\n\nTorrance is a forthright person, loyal to the cheerleading squad, full of pep and vigor, and unwilling to cheat to get her way. On her first day as the squad captain, one of the cheerleaders is injured - injured enough to miss any and all future practices, games, and tournaments. Torrance and her crew audition a few students - male and female, and some who aren't old enough to be in high school - and all appears to be lost until Missy Pantone, the stereotypical new-kid-in-school-who's-also-from-the-wrong-side-of-the-tracks, comes along.\nAfter much ado and some obvious snobbery on the part of her fellow cheerleaders, Torrance accepts Missy. There's some reluctance on both parts. But before too long, Torrance learns (through Missy) that the cheers that have done so well for the squad for so long have been swiped from a tougher school in LA, one that's perpetually underfunded (conveniently). Oh, and Torrance is also slowly falling for Missy's brother Cliff (Jesse Bradford). Oh the complications of being a blonde cheerleader in San Diego! (Hold your cynicism, please!)\nThe thing is, according to the other cheerleaders, swiping cheers is standard operating procedure, so Torrance's ethics are overruled. But then when it comes time for the regional cheerleader tournament (yes, such a beast exists, albeit only in captivity!), they find that yet another squad has duplicated some of their own cheers. The San Diego squad does their own and is reprimanded by the judges.\nOk, there's your plot. Fill in the rest as you will. This ain't Shakespeare, folks. Ya gets what ya pays when you see this movie. Don't expect anything all that wonderful. Dunst, however, is a lot of fun as Torrance, and Bradford is her equal as her erstwhile love interest. I will sheepishly admit to laughing out loud at some of the lines in the movie, but overall it wasn't all that impressive. This might be a good movie to watch if you're doing something else, that is, as background material. As cheerleader movies go, it could have been worse (like Satan's Cheerleaders, from 1977)."}

I found some.\nThe Blair Witch Project was, if nothing else, an interesting movie. Many people thought it was the most revolutionary movie of its time, due in no small part to the realism. Audiences found themselves believing every step of the movie. And, of course, the endless Internet hype didn't hurt. Many of us watched that film before the popular press piled on - and nothing kills a movie quicker than overhype. If critics tell you a movie's wonderful, your expectations are massive, sometimes insurmountable. This is perhaps why a lot of people I've talked to hated, hated, hated The Blair Witch Project. They illogically thought the movie would be the best thing ever created, even better than sliced bread, hot tubs, the Internet, or shoe horns. Imagine their disappointment when it was just a movie!\nThat said, the sequel - which was made with a much, much bigger budget, was even more hyped, although not in the underground, independent-film style of its predecessor. Book of Shadows was marketed in a wide multimedia campaign, boasting of its shock value and of its relation to the first film.\nIt has failed in every possible way to be entertaining.\nThe story has a \"tour group\" prowling the forest around Burkittsville, Maryland, the site of the first film. The recovered videotape from the first movie has led to a huge influx of tourist to the area and its beleaguered residents. Naturally, people make money off the tourism, and a few give tours of the forest. The movie focuses on one of these tour groups, comprised of a couple of lovers, a couple of witches, and the arrogant SOB who's running the tour itself. These people couldn't get much more caricatured.\nMany years ago, William Castle held a nationwide casting call for a movie called 13 Ghosts. The movie wound up being one of the worst of its kind (a haunted-house mystery), and most of the very amateur actors in the movie never acted again. Book of Shadows does not have that level of professionalism or of thespian promise.\nRemember those cheesy movies - in the 60's, it was beach movies; in the 70's, it was biker movies; in the 80's, it was arcade game movies - that you and your pals laughed at and threw popcorn at? The acting was bad, the production was bad - you even got lucky some times and saw an errant microphone.\nThe difference between those films and Book of Shadows is that this movie had a budget. But the acting is atrocious. Every line is delivered either flatly or with wild, over-the-top emotion. These kids have no idea how to act. They ACT like they're acting! Sure, you're saying, the original's actors weren't actually veteran actors, either. True, true, I concur, but those actors were playing their roles naturally, as if we were watching them voyeuristically. Book of Shadows didn't even attempt to do this. Much of Blair Witch was shot in black and white with handheld cameras - held BY the actors. Not this time. Professional cameramen held their expensive cameras while their decidedly amateur cast screwed up their deliveries. It's like going to an acting class for nonactors - people who can't act have a tendency to overact, to overplay, overenunciate, overindulge, and just plain overestimate the audience's capacity for dull, uninteresting crap.\nThen there's the effects. I could probably come up with better special effects on my tiny PC with one little graphic program. The editing was childish. The cinematography was below anyone's standards, even if one had a tiny budget. With a bigger budget, you would think better filming would take place. Au contraire!\nIt's been a long time since I've seen a movie this horrid in every way. Oh, and the ending? I won't be dumb enough to give it out to you, but it's no mystery. This is a stunningly awful movie, content to make its bed in the den of The Blair Witch Project. It's like an overprivileged son who doesn't feel he needs to stand on his own two feet to survive, only to learn his wealthy daddy won't support him."}

I know,sounds goofy, doesn't it? One of America's Sweethearts playing an uglier-than-thou role. Trust me, though; Miss Bullock does pull it off. Bullock's Gracie Hart is mousy and sloppy. She chews with her mouth open, spits, burps, and is generally the very picture of uncouth behavior.\n\nOne of her colleagues, Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt) finally gets the opportunity to run his own operation - stop the series of mad-bombers. He's not especially bright; he's more of a pretty boy who's more interested in playing with the ladies than in working on a case, although he loves the glory attached to success. The FBI learns that the next probable target for this bomber is the Miss United States Pageant to be held in San Antonio, Texas, right next door to the Alamo. After much fruitless deliberation, Eric finally decides an officer must go undercover at the pageant and, of course, he settles on Gracie, who looks (in these scenes) about as sexy as a muddy street. \nAh, but Gracie must undergo a bit of a transformation! Enter disgraced pageant mentor Victor Melling (Michael Caine). Victor's task: transform Gracie into a princess. In scenes reminiscent of My Fair Lady (Gracie even calls him \"Henry Higgins\" at one point), Victor shows Gracie how to walk, how to talk, and how to eat like a lady. Mission accomplished! Except for the talent... But Gracie does manage to find a way!\nWhat's most surprising about this movie is Bullock's success in playing a down-and-dirty role. As Gracie, she's not supposed to be a cute girl playing a slob; she's a slob playing a cutie. And since Bullock is pretty darn cute herself, she's a cutie playing a slob playing a cutie. That ain't easy, folks. (Not that I know firsthand, mind you.) And her prowess at playing physical comedy is also quite formidable. Case in point: In an early scene, Gracie comes home from work very frustrated. She slams doors, knocks into things accidentally, opens the freezer and takes out a frozen dinner, and tosses it into the microwave. Then slams its door shut and starts away. Only it doesn't close. So she comes back and slams it again. Still won't close. She's getting more and more frustrated - and I'm sure you can all relate to this - and the process repeats a few times. Finally, she wedges a cooking spoon in the door jamb to make it stay shut. I was rolling at that point, and I was not alone in my mirth!\nBullock's supporting crew is fine, although I think Bratt was a bit of a pain (character-wise, and no pun intended). Bullock's FBI boss (Ernie Hudson) was fair, but inconsequential. The coolest characters were played by Candace Bergen (as the pageant director) and William Shatner (as the pageant's host, a la Bert Parks). Both were wildly over the top. And yes, Shatner sings.\nThis was a surprisingly good film. Watch it!"}

Both are A-list stars, among the most bankable in Hollywood. And director Robert Zemeckis is no slouch either, having helmed (among others) such Tom Hanks vehicles as Forrest Gump and Cast Away. You wouldn't think such a cast and director would deign to be in a horror film, albeit one with a sizable budget, but here they are, in this wonderful, captivating thriller.\nClaire (Pfeiffer) and Norman (Ford) are a well-to-do married couple living on a somewhat palacial lakeside estate in Vermont. Norman's a research scientist and spends much of his time finishing papers and giving lectures while Claire stays at home, dealing with the emotional aftereffects of a recent car crash.\nNorman has a stepdaughter, Caitlin, who goes off to college at the beginning of the movie. For the first time in years, Claire is alone in the house, and she notices strange things afoot. She experiences some strange phenomena, including a woman's reflection in her bathwater. The fragile Claire is convinced the disturbances have something to do with the strange couple next door, and urges her husband to look into the matter. He finds nothing, of course, and asks her to see a therapist, thinking that his lovely wife is still unstable.\nBut the therapist recommends contacting whatever might be causing the disturbances, and that's when the fun begins. Is this a typical haunted house story? Assuredly not, dear friend. The people in the house are not killed off one by one until the Hero and Heroine face the Ghost in a Bull Run standoff. This is a fascinating thriller, with the audience with Claire all the way. There are more twists to this plot than in the typical tax form. Many screenwriters keep horror/thriller plots as simple as possible to avoid confusion and to avoid stepping on their own toes. Sarah Kernochan and Clark Gregg do not take any shortcuts here, though. Every turn is a hair-raising ride; every other scene is jaw-dropping. It would be easy to throw in everything but the kitchen sink, but when that happens you have a plot filled with nonsequiturs. Not so here, folks. You know how sometimes critics tell you not to look too closely at the plot, because then the holes show through? Go ahead, I dare you to look closely at this one.\nZemeckis directed this while he was on hiatus from Cast Away (which was necessary so Tom Hanks could get in the right shape for the rest of the movie). Some people mock Zemeckis for being simply a director of films that simply appeal to the masses; he's criticized for being successful despite himself. His work here, however, shows how talented he really is. For example, many directors rely on loud soundtracks to \"sell\" their blockbuster films. But in What Lies Beneath, Zemeckis made great use of the ultimate sound - silence. And that's how you make a creepy movie, folks. The guys behind The Blair Witch Project knew it, too.

The film is directed by noted underground director John Waters, and Waters tosses in scores of Hollywood in-jokes (check out the marquee during the opening credits!). The reason more people didn't see this in the theater is simply that it's so... so... different. It's highly unique, and therefore less likely to appeal to a mass audience.\nBut you do need to see it, really! Cecil B. Demented (Dorff) is the leader of a motley band of would-be film aficionados who kidnap a Hollywood actress (Melanie Griffith) at the premiere of her latest film. Demented's idea is to make a movie using guerrilla tactics, making the statement that studio films are Bad and independent films are Good. Waters' point is that the studio system is such that any movie coming out of it fits into a formula to make it more palatable to the masses - that is, that the movies you see in the multiplexes are dumbed down for your viewing pleasure.\n\nDemented tries to achieve his vision by staging protests of a sort at movie houses, film screenings, speeches, and even a drive-in. His entourage includes a Satanist, a former porn star, and many other social and sexual deviants. There's hardly a taboo subject Waters doesn't cover here! And to be sure, the character of Demented himself never changes, which is in itself a welcome respite. Had this been a Hollywood film, you might have seen the nefarious filmmaker suddenly see the error of his ways in the final three minutes. I won't give anything away to you, folks, but rest assured that the characters remain true to themselves, except for Griffith's character. She changes, but it's a subtle, honest change. \nThere are surprises everywhere you turn, but let me warn you: this is absolutely not a film for everyone. There is plenty here to offend even the most open of minds. It is at once a unique, refreshing, and exciting film. It never even rests to catch its breath - it doesn't want the audience to fall back into its Hollywoodized lull. \nMajor kudos for screenwriting go to Waters and to his amazing cast. If you're into offbeat films, please watch this."}

Except the laughs are about as frequent as they would be for an actual mental patient - in other words, mental illness comedy ain't funny, it's forced.\n\nJim Carrey plays Charlie, a Rhode Island state trooper who is cycling to upstate New York with a prisoner in tow - Irene (Rene Zellwegger), who has been accused of a hit-and-run crime in New York. Charlie seems like a nice guy, except Irene notices he takes pills. Why, she asks? Because, Charlie explains, if he doesn't take one every six hours he feels..... funny. Something about paranoid schizophrenia. Irene gives that old nod-and-smile reaction we've all given to someone before.\nThere are two plots at work here. One is the someone-framed-Irene-and-we-know-who-but-the-good-guys-won't-until-the-end-of-the-movie plot, and the other is the one that tries to set the movie apart. Charlie's schizophrenia, you see, has manifested itself in the guise of Hank, a tough-talking, insensitive, loutish bully who is everything Charlie is not. Naturally, while Irene is in Charlie's custody, Hank comes out at certain times, and hilarity ensues. (Charlie also has three African American kids! His ex-wife ran off with a short-statured African American limo driver - coincidence? - and the three kids, now in high school, feature prominently in this film.)\nBut for me, hilarity does NOT ensue. I found most of the jokes to be forced, even cloying. I found that I pitied Charlie more than I laughed with him. I found his romance of Irene (and don't forget, Zellwegger was his beau at the time) to be a little trite. To me, they didn't quite have the necessary chemistry. Yes, there were a few funny moments in the movie - and the kids were funny at times. I found this movie to be wildly uneven, funny in spots, dull in many others. I don't think Carrey's made a good film in a little while now, and I hope he can turn it around soon before he becomes the new Chevy Chase."}

He and his crack research team, funded by the military, have succeeded in making a gorilla invisible - but not in making her visible again. Caine, with the personality of a cactus, finally reaches his breakthrough after an all-night session of caffeine and Twinkies. Marshaling his troops, Caine injects the gorilla with a new serum and the animal is brought back to visible light, albeit with a lot of difficulty.\n\nCaine, along with his top lieutenants Linda (Elisabeth Shue) and Matthew (Josh Brolin) in tow, reports to the military committee that has lavished grant after grant on him and his team. Caine shocks his colleagues, however, when he doesn't report the true success of their research. Later he tells them confidentially that he believes if the project funders knew of the team's success, they would take over the project. He asserts that the logical course of action is to move on to Phase 3 of their project - human testing. Naturally, Caine arrogantly volunteers to be the guinea pig, saying that as the project's leader, he should have the honor.\n\nWell, if you paid any attention to the previews of this movie, you can guess there were some complications. For one, the serum injected into the gorilla isn't sufficient to bring Caine back to the land of visibility. The caustic Caine, growing increasingly aggressive, at first waits semi-patiently while his team tries to find a way to bring him back. Ah, but then he gets restless..\nThe key to this film is Caine himself, of course. He's never portrayed as a nice guy, always as a driven, possessed man scientist who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. This means that when he becomes invisible - and turns on his team - the change isn't a Jeckyll-and-Hyde transformation. To me, this is good character development. And Bacon plays him well, playing against his normal persona of good guy (and sometimes of good guy gone wrong, as in his recent Stir of Echoes). You never think to yourself, \"Oh, it's Kevin Bacon. He'll have a change of heart near the end and save the day and get the girl.\" Truth is, Bacon usually plays likable guys. This time, though, Caine's not likeable: he's despicable, absorbed in himself, wallowing in a mire of reckless ego. At one point he tells another character he's God. I'm not one for giving away endings, but I will tell you that Caine is true to character throughout the movie.\nThis is a movie with razor-sharp teeth. It's the kind of movie that'll sneak up on you while you're walking down the street, drag you into an alley, and gnaw the nose off your face. It's a tough movie, bitter in its depiction of man versus nature and what man knows may bring out his demise. This is more than a simple remake of The Invisible Man, although it does owe a bit of its origins to the book by H. G. Wells and the 1942 movie of the same name (which starred Claude Rains). As expected, the effects are dazzling - see Caine turn into smoke, fog, water, and so on while invisible, the elements swirling around him like a three-dimensional silhouette. Special effects, when done properly, can be very poetic, and the crew on Hollow Man deserves highest praise. \nBacon's supporting cast deserves a little credit as well, but not too much. Oddly enough, Shue is billed ahead of Bacon, even though it's clearly his show all the way. Her role is that of the ex-lover who's on the team because she's such a dedicated scientist and who also happens to be involved with someone else on the team, without Caine's knowledge. She gets to play good girl/heroine in this one, although one suspects her award-winning talents weren't really put to the test here. Brolin, as her love interest, isn't much more than a bland quart of vanilla ice cream - the store-bought kind without the flecks of vanilla bean."}

So did I, but Tom Hanks' character doesn't wind up on the island until a good 20 minutes of filler material have been used. Filler material, in most movies, is the kind of plot information that seems superfluous at first but is later tied into the plot itself. So we're 20 minutes into a movie and finally see Chuck Noland (Hanks) on the island. You can see where this review is headed, can't you? \nFirst off, there's the title. Cast Away? Why not Castaway? Why make it into two words? A puzzlement, to be sure. I know, I know... nitpicking! No, it's not! If it's two words, it says to me someone has been cast away - but Chuck hasn't been cast away, he's been marooned. Maybe the makers didn't want anyone to confuse it with the Survivor TV show. I think they should have gone with the one-word title, but hey - that's just me.\nThe movie is a little over two hours long, and in the bulk of that time we follow Chuck's exploits on the island. We see his trials, his failures, his successes, and his thought processes. And it all really is mesmerizing, as long as you suspend some of your logic processes. This happens with a lot of action/adventure type movies, because the focus is on what's happening, not why it's happening. Sometimes you'll see an illogical chain of events in an action movie, and you'll dismiss it because you're there to see the action, not to be bothered with the plot. Well, friends, I am bothered by it! I wondered how Chuck survived the plane crash and why he got out what looked like everything in his pocket just before the plane hit turbulence but once the trouble started he only grabbed his precious pocket watch. I wondered if I was watching a long commercial for Federal Express (see how many logos you can spot). \nI've seen some people say this is one of the top movies of the year. Sorry, I can't see that. It's fun to watch, but the compelling stuff in the middle is surrounded by a beginning and an end that slow down the pacing of the film immeasurably. Sure, I care about Chuck's beau Kelly (Helen Hunt), and I know that setting up their relationship at the outset is somewhat important. But it's more than a little contrived when his last words to her before jumping on the plane are \"I'll be right back.\" Come on! All of the supporting plot surrounding his adventures on the island seems to be horribly contrived, as if someone said, \"Great, love the whole island thing, now throw in some more stuff  so we can get over 2 hours out of it.\" I mean it all seems almost tacked on, and it's all too pat. I will say this much, though: the ending is NOT cliched.\nHanks is better than I expected. He's not really the adventurer type, is he? In some scenes, with his scraggly beard and makeshift clothing, he looks like Lawrence of Arabia or maybe Moses from The Ten Commandments. He effectively shows emotion, determination, perseverence, wit, and ingenuity. I'd also say he ages well, too, but then you have to remember Robert Zemeckis filmed this movie in two installments so he could do What Lies Beneath; this layoff allowed Hanks to transform from girly man Fed Ex dude to strapping strongman (sort of). Everyone else is just extraneous. This is Tom's game."}

I think they even tossed the kitchen sink, too. The basic plot is that there's this really hot-looking doctor (Jennifer Lopez) who undergoes this cool experimental procedure in which she enters the mind of another human being - in her case, a child in a coma. Her skills are tapped when an intrepid detective (Vince Vaughn) has captured a schizophrenic serial killer (Vincent D'Onfrio) who is in such an advanced state of psychosis that he's unconscious and is therefore unable to reveal to the police the location of his latest victim, who is apparently trapped in a cell-like glass container that has enough food and water for 72 hours, but no more (then, apparently, the cell floods - you may have seen that in the promos for the movie). Enter Miss Lopez, who wanders into this sicko's mind, finding out why he is what he is and trying her goldangist to find out where the young lady is.\nIf nothing else, this is not a dull movie. In fact, the \"Wow, cool!\" quotient of The Cell is pretty high. Let's just say that if you're into mindbending horror films, this might be the one for you. There IS some gore, there's a whole lot of cussin', and quite frankly no one under 21 should see it. There's no sex, however (darn!). But there's a LOT of visual imagery. Kind of like Beetlejuice combined with Army of Darkness. There is a lot of torture and a few absolutely shocking acts. It's disturbing, never calming. And Lopez is the one who holds it all together. Many models-turned-actresses/singers can't hack it in more than one profession, but clearly there is some talent at work here. She's a delight, never innocent, but never in over her head, either. Her character is strong, resilient, and very intelligent. Vaughn, who doesn't have enough scenes with Lopez, plays against type as the take-charge lawman on the job (although he's a little stereotypical); I usually see him as the bad guy, but here he's Johnny Cop. Good casting!\nThis is a jaw-dropping experience you probably won't forget too quickly. But then again, in a few years, it'll probably be pass\u00e9' and you won't hardly remember The Cell."}

Oh, and there are references to The Matrix as well, and other movies whose names escape me at the moment. The film is the handiwork of Marlon and Shawn Wayans, and it's as if they took the scripts of the gee-aren't-we-hip horror movies of recent years and shot the hell out of them. Ripped asunder, these scripts are funnier than ever. You've got the opening scene of Scream where the sexy starlet is terrorised by the guy on the phone who can see her, you've got the scene in I Know What You Did Last Summer where the joyriding kids run over someone, plus you have scenes from all those old horror movies where the hero/heroine is running up the stairs, chased by a madman (Halloween comes to mind).\nYour main characters are an amalgam of the kids from IKWYDLS and the Scream monstrosities. You remember: the Romeo, the virgin, the slut, the BMOC (big man on campus), and at least one African American tossed in for some good ol' ethnic diversity. You see, while the Scream series thought it was poking fun at other, more revered horror films while not taking itself seriously, you don't need to have Protean intelligence to realise that the in-jokes were just dumb and overwrought, like elitist coeds snickering at something they didn't understand. Well turn those frowns upside-down, folks! The Wayans boys know what they're doing. The simple vacuousness of the characters in those lesser flicks is exaggerated perfectly in Scary Movie. There's not a sacred cow left untipped!\nI won't delve into the plot, they introduced a whole stoner subplot that had me in stitches, too. This is lowbrow humor executed perfectly. I might not care a whit for Scary Movie in a few years, but for now it's one of the hippest, funniest movies of the year."}

You do the math. Nicholas Cage plays a retired car thief (!) who is forced to pull One Last Job because the local hood with the obligatory indecipherable Anglo-Saxon Euro-trash accent will kill his brother. This plot DOES seem familiar, like the boxer coming out of retirement for One Last Fight or the guy who's been released from jail but has to pull off One Last Heist to satisfy some lowlife. Anyway, there's your plot. The man's promised 50 cars to some other lowlife, and naturally no one around can steal them as quickly as the now-retired Memphis Raines (Cage). Oh, he's clean now. Yep, works at a lonely gas station. He's in charge of the go-carts. This is what goes for a car thieves' retirement home in Hollywood.\nUndaunted, Raines calls in his old cronies. Oops, that one's dead. Oops, that one's absconded with money to Florida. Oops, that one went with him. And so the list dwindles, and he's forced to deal with his younger brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) and his own little gang of would-be thieves. Oh, and there's Robert Duvall, playing the usual Old Man of the Gang, the Voice of Reason; and Angelina Jolie, the requisite ex-flame of Memphis - reluctantly, she agrees to help. Surprisingly, there's unfinished business between them!\nI'll leave it to you to decide whether Raines gets the job done. But in between there are about a million car crashes, a few good throwaway lines, and of course the equation of stealing automobiles to sex. If this movie had been released in the 1970's (and believe it or not, there WAS a movie called Gone in Sixty Seconds that came out in 1974), the trailer for it would contain words like Thrills! Chills! And Spills! There are a few quirky things tossed into the script like so many red herrings before, but they're only there to make the movie look different than any other cheesy car chase film from the 1950's to the present\nAs for the acting, it's a mixed bag. Duvall's his usual stalwart self, although he does seem to be playing the same patriarchal roles over and over. Jolie isn't as prominent as I would have expected, but I think this was filmed before her Oscar-winning turn in Girl, Interrupted. And Cage? Well, Nic Cage CAN act when he wants to.

In other words, a bombastic, explicit, harrowing, no-holds-barred epic. And succeed the action auteur has.\nRussell Crowe plays Maximus, a loyal general in the Roman army. The Romans have conquered most of the civilized world, and there is only one outpost remaining. The stolid Maximus and his troops overtake the enemy, earning the grace of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). The dying Emperor calls his general to his bedside and tells him that when he's shuffled off this mortal coil, he wants Maximus to be the \"defender of Rome\" and the leadership of the empire to go not to his son but back to the long-abandoned Roman Senate. It's quite a radical plan for the Emperor to have, and Maximus, against his own wishes, consents. \nWhen the aged Aurelius dies, however, the plan changes. The  Emperor's snotty, belligerent son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) assumes command (which is easy, since he's the son and no one else knew of the Emperor's plans) and orders the execution of Maximus. The stunned general is led off, but naturally defeats his captors. He becomes a slave and is eventually sold to Proximus (Oliver Reed, in his final movie) and is forced to fight as a gladiator in arenas for the amusement of the aristocrats (severe shades of Spartacus!). And, of course, he must somehow win his freedom, get the girl (who happens to be Commodus' sister), and avenge the murders of his wife and son, which happened when he was to be executed.\nCrowe grips his sword with an unyielding passion, gladly taking up the mantle passed to him by such golden-boy icons as Mel Gibson and Harrison Ford. He's been touted as the Next Big Thing for a while now, but he seems like he'll be sticking around. Check him out in L.A. Confidential - or if you're in the mood for mediocre fluff, try Virtuosity with Denzel Washington. But Gladiator is the absolute pinnacle of Crowe's relatively brief career. The Aussie magnificently holds his own as an action star and still finds time to emote properly. (Ah, I'm such a sucker for a good emote!) Those of you who want to see him shirtless, you're in luck - however, in some of the scenes he's buried in some seriously huge and obtrusive armor.\nCrowe's Maximus is completely loyal to the empire, and it blows his mind that he could go from being so highly respected in the land to being a slave. But this is not a morality tale of how a well-off man must suffer so that he may know the less-fortunate; in fact, there's not much moralizing here (aside from the usual vengeance-shall-be-mine theme). Once he's escaped his executioners, Maximus adopts an attitude of grim determination. He's relentless in his goal - he MUST save Rome. This kind of character development we don't get to see much in action movies, and while the movie is exceptionally well written for such a genre film, it's really Crowe's show. A lesser actor might have grunted and grimaced his way through much of the dialogue, but Crowe was more than up to the task. This was a blockbuster at the box office, and with great reason. This might even be one for the ages. My policy is to never overpraise a film as a \"classic\" (or, worse yet, \"instant classic,\" as if you only needed to add water), so I'll restrain myself here. The best way to find out if a movie is a classic is to wait 20 years. This way you get a more subjective historical perspective on the film - who's to say that in 20 years we'll think of this film as a nostalgia piece of the early 2000's?"}

Why have a plausible plot twist when three or four explosions will do? Sure, I'm nit-picking. That's what I do. Critics (professional or amateur) pick nits. You could certainly watch this movie and be suitably entertained. I guess it always irks me when a movie takes 90 minutes of plot and stretches it to 120 minutes by using music and explosions. And that's not to say that the action scenes aren't elaborately and masterfully staged.\nSome of the acting is really unbelievable, including Scott and even Cruise himself. It's one of those going-through-the-motions motion pictures, albeit the kind where the star is getting $20 million and relies on special effects to bail him out. Didn't these people bother to read their lines before rehearsal? Oh wait, I forgot - there's no need for Method acting when duelling motorcycles will do. And did I mention the love scenes? Who does Cruise think he is, Sean Connery? It's bad enough M:I parrots nearly all of the Bond films regarding the international locations and explosions galore, but now Hunt has to be the Casanova to end all Casanovas. Yes, I'm quite aware he's a hunk and all that, but let's remember - he's probably shorter than you. Being in front of a camera can add inches to your height as well as to your weight!\nYou might get the impression here that I wasn't too fond of this film. Au contraire, mon frere du cinema! While it's not Shakespeare, it's also certainly not Stallone. For that, I bestow copious kudos to the filmmakers, who decided not to completely dumb it down to us. And hey, if we would rather not be distracted by a tortuous plot, so be it. So enjoy: it's solid entertainment, not too bad for a sequel."}

This was no mere theatrical release. It looked like live action, but it was all done on a computer (or, more precisely, many computers). The toys looked staggeringly real. They looked not like cartoon characters but what you might find on the floor of a kid's unkempt room. And what's more, they had more life than most characters played by real-life actors. \nA standard axiom of animated feature films says that the greater the original, the lesser the sequel. The higher the roman or arabic numeral after the title, the worse the quality will be. There have been sequels to Snow White, The Jungle Book, Aladdin, The Lion King, and others that were measurably worse than the original films. It's a pattern as old as movies themselves, and of course it applies to live-action movies as well. In general - good original = bad sequel; great original = so-so sequel.\nAnd this is where Toy Story 2 breaks the rules. Ah, those folks at Pixar (and, of course, at Disney). While the original took place largely in Andy's room, the second film wanders out into the streets of the city - and even to a toy store! All of the gang is back from the first one, including the late Jim Varney as Slinky Dog. What's the plot? Woody (Tom Hanks) is swiped from Andy's front yard (he wasn't supposed to be sold, don't fret!) by a toy-store owner (Wayne Knight) looking to cash in on Woody's value as a collectible. Naturally, the other toys, led by Buzz Lightyear, launch a rescue mission. But does Woody want to be rescued? We're introduced to three new characters, the other dolls in a collectible set from a long-ago TV show. You know, kind of like Howdy Doody, only everyone was a marionette. With Woody completing the set, these toys are to be sold to a Japanese museum. Will Woody go with his new friends and live in a museum, or will he return with Buzz and company to stay with Andy?\nThe movie introduces some wonderful, thought-provoking material. Kids will be entertained by the exploits of Woody and his friends, but they'll learn without knowing they're being taught, and that might be the most effective way for kids to learn lessons anyway. For example, Woody has a moral dilemma - go or stay - and while he resolves it diplomatically, he doesn't (or the screenwriters don't) take the easy way out. Also, our old pal Buzz seems to have matured since the last movie (!) and has his OWN dilemma to deal with. We see these toys' frailities, and it makes them so real to us. Kids see them and identify with the toys. We don't just have superheroes saving the day from evil. We have toys that might just as well be the children themselves, and you have to admire the verisimilitude of the script itself. It's a script that's racuously funny, with some references only the adults will get, and deliciously crisp - it's not a carbon-copy plot."}

At any rate, Emmerich was taking on quite a challenge, for the last American Revolution movie was that 1985 Al Pacino disaster \"Revolution\". 1776 never seemed so distant as when Al donned that furry hat and passed himself off as an 18th-century trader. Oh, sure, with that accent, no less.\nThis time around, there's a foreigner at the fore. Mel Gibson's from Australia, as some of you might know. Wouldn't know it to hear him speak, of course, with an American accent that's more fluid than anything most of us will ever use in our own lifetimes. Get Mel behind closed doors, though, and I suspect he's all ready to put a shrimp on the ol' barbie. Here, of course, he's as American as he always is in the cinema. Gibson stars as Benjamin Martin, calm farmer, hero of the French and Indian War. Legend has it that Martin went crazy at Fort Wilderness (not the place in Disney World, I soon discovered) and killed a bunch of bad guys. But now he's older and wiser, and he's darn sure he won't be laying to arms against any ol' Redcoats, taxes or no taxes. He's got something like nine kids to feed, all by himself (all you single moms out there, feel free to either commiserate or express your outrage). Well, things tend to change quickly in movies, even if the movie's 160 minutes long (ouch!). Before too long, Ben's pitchfork-deep in the melee, helping the colonials to defeat the British, who are represented (rather haughtily, of course) by Lord Cornwallis. Those of you who remember your history know that eventually \n(WARNING! WARNING! PLOT ENDING REVEALED! DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU LIKE SURPRISES ABOUT THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR, WHICH OCCURRED OVER 220 YEARS AGO!)\n\nCornwallis surrenders, and the colonists win their freedom. Ah, but half the fun is getting there, right? Luckily, the movie doesn't bog us down with historical details such as battles, dates, etc. Remember Braveheart, that movie with an Australian playing the part of a Scotsman who rallies his people to revolt? This movie's not like that at all, since we have an Australian playing the part of an American who rallies his people to revolt. But while both films are completely different (!), let's look at some wonderful similarities. Disorganized rabble? Check. Evil despot? Check. Gallons and gallons of spilled blood per person? Check. Gratuitous violence? Check and double check!\nIf this were viewed as a historical drama, there would be all sorts of problems with the accuracy of the plot (in fact, the British complained loud and often when the movie premiered, something about it portraying them as evil despots bent on world dominance, or something). Luckily, most of us don't care a whit about such stuff and nonsense, so we look at this movie to show us action. Pounds and pounds of action, preferably in the form of senseless violence. I mean there are decapitations! Who wouldn't want to see that? Many people, of course, but not too many - this film kicked butt at the box office. \nAs a morality tale of sticking to your guns, the film loses its way a little, I think. Benjamin Martin goes against his beliefs for some pretty solid reasons, but after he takes the plunge, all bets are off and we have a straightforward action movie. But as a chance to see Mel strut his hero stuff, it's golden"}

Now the survivors must face the unknown - and each other - in a never-ending game of terror.\nSound familiar? Okay, maybe a little. But there are a couple of hooks in this movie. One is that the planet these guys have landed on has three suns, and wouldn't ya know it all three suns are about ready to align, plunging the planet into a complete and lasting darkness. Add to this creepy setting a malicious convict named Riddick (Vin Diesel) who's gone to the trouble of having his eyeballs surgically altered so he can see in the dark, the better to sneak up on you, my dear. This is explained to us rather poignantly early on, and of course his eyesight becomes useful later on.\n\nThere are two ways to look at this movie - either as generic drama, powered by a plot, or as a horror film. Those of you looking at it as a horror film already have low standards (admit it!), so you won't be disappointed. I don't mean to belittle you, but let's face it - when you want to sit down to a good horror film, the story isn't always a top priority. You want stuff that'll scare you! If you're looking at this as a drama - man versus self, man versus alien planet, and so forth - you still won't be disappointed. In short, there are two things going for this - an excellent use of special effects (and, consequently, a great sense of what's creepy) and a solid plot. You can't go wrong. \nTo complicate matters, the remaining humans - now deep in darkness, with only flares, flashlights, etc. to help them - are besieged by nasty flying alien creatures who only attack in the dark. Seeing the ripe and ready flesh of the humans must seem like an all-you-can-eat buffet to the aliens. And if the outside threat isn't enough, our heroes have to deal with Riddick, who's released from his chains early on. Will he kill them all? Will aliens slaughter them in their sleep?\nI won't get into the acting except to say that I have movie posters in my house that have more emotion and personality. And the script itself - the dialog sounds as if it were written by a high-schooler. But there are a lot of genuinely startling moments, and there's a magnificent atmosphere to the whole deal. You never get to settle in to the movie, and that's key to a horror film, in my book. At no point did I have a chance to sit back and notice how bad the acting was, and that's quite a feat. So, in short, you can either look at this movie super-critically (in which case you won't be pleased, unless you delight in finding fault!) or simply go with the flow. It's a scary ride, folks, because you don't know what you'll run into when it's dark."}

Take Back to the Future, for example. A space-time continuum? Gigawatts? A time machine made out of a Delorean? But what unites that film with a movie like Frequency is that if you change one thing in the past, the consequences spilling from that action could be dire indeed.\nDennis Quaid is Frank Sullivan, a firefighter in 1969 New York. The Amazin' Mets are in the World Series and he has a loving wife and son. At the other end of our time spectrum is John Sullivan, a cop in 1999 New York. John is Frank's son. Finding his late father's old ham radio in a hall closet, John turns it on and happens to find himself talking to his long-dead father. How long? Frank died in 1969, right around the time of the World Series, in a warehouse fire. Amazin', isn't it?\nThe primary event that sets off all of the other events is the saving of Frank's life - he's supposed to have died in the warehouse fire, but John tells him about it ahead of time. Frank lives, and now all changes. And, of course, the only two people who can tell the difference are Frank and John themselves. This is a standard plot device, although I'm sure it would also be the case in real life. It's where No One Believes the Hero. Just once, I'd like to see Our Hero explain to the Authorities that he was abducted by aliens, they seemed nice but aloof at first, but now they're headed right this way -- and then have the Authorities say, \"Wow, we better get ready for them! Set my phaser on kill!\" But that doesn't happen. The Men in Charge never seem to believe Our Heroes, no matter how logical they may make the situation seem. Frank, of course, tries to convince his old buddy Satch (Andre Braugher) that a killer on the loose is not him (Frank, that is) and that the real killer is... someone else. But will Satch hear of it? Heck, no! Even when Frank tries to tell him how the '69 World Series will wind up (thus injecting logic where logic cannot exist; but remember, movies are the vacuums of logic, even the ones that don't suck), Satch merely gets mean and nasty and forgets he's Frank's pal.\nBut this is a wonderful story, no doubt about it. There are some very well-done scenes, both thoughtful and thought-provoking. The writers obviously didn't want to take the easy way out and use movie logic all the time. The bottom line is that the effects are very nicely done (and even better on DVD) and the plot itself is tight. Don't wear yourself out looking for loopholes; just be content to be fascinated by this surprisingly mesmerizing movie."}

You know all about those secret societies; they breed smart, rich young men who will put other smart, rich young men in power, and then those men will put other smart, rich young men in power, and so forth and yadda yadda yadda. You can find out all sorts of things about Skull and Bones online, and I suppose there's a chance some of those things are actually true. But for the purposes of this movie - and this review - suffice to say that The Skulls is a small group mostly made up of rich white kids who get paid scholarships, free cars, free women, the whole works. And what does this secret society ask for in return? Unbound loyalty, of course. Unquestioning and absolute loyalty, kind of like the Mob, really, only the Mob is more overtly criminal.\nThe story focuses on Luke, a townie at Yale University. Luke wants to go to law school, but the tuition's a little high. He's parentless and low on funds, so of course he's prime pickings for The Skulls. Will he join them? Darn tootin' he will, despite the protests of his best friend and this hot young blonde he likes. They try to reason with him, believing their friendship is stronger than his need to be a lawyer, but they're wrong. If they were right, we'd have no movie.\nSo he joins, and wouldn't you know it, all kinds of bad things happen to poor Luke. There's murder, there's corruption, and gosh and golly, our boy just doesn't know who to trust. More twists than a Poe novel; the only problem is, they're not believable twists. If you're cynical about this kind of movie (as I am), you'll laugh out loud many times, both at the acting and the dialogue. The worst offense is in the timing, quite frankly. At no point are we led to believe that this society could be a GOOD thing. We know immediately it's bad. See, I think to be truly sinister you need to wear a mask of credibility. If I already know how bad you are, I won't be as afraid of you or as startled when you actually do something despicable.\nThis is a real chucklefest, in the same vein as Final Destination, Urban Legends, I Know What You Did Last Summer (both movies), and even the Scream movies, which I didn't care for (but I know many of you did, so whatcha gonna do). You have an attractive cast spouting incredible lines in unbelievable situations. The old moviegoer in us wonders what Jimmy Stewart or Gregory Peck would have done in this movie when they were younger (and, in Stewart's case, alive), but that's probably a philosophical debate best left to denizens of the old critics' home. As for me, I'd say pass on The Skulls - it's as hollow as its name might imply."}

The title is the name of a thoroughbred racehorse about to be sold by Carter (Jeff Bridges) for millions of dollars. But wouldn't you know it, the well-to-do Carter gets a phone call from his longtime, ne'er-do-well pal Vinnie (Nick Nolte) with some malarkey about being in trouble and needing Carter to bail him out or else he'll go to the police with this long-ago secret.\nSo in a plot more tortuous than a mutant pretzel, Carter flies out to Vinnie from Kentucky to California, hoping to get his friend out of trouble so he can get back to the multimillion-dollar horse deal. Ah, but wouldn't you know it, life's just not that simple for Carter. Naturally, Vinnie swipes his car, drives back to the airport, and flies back east to see Carter's wife Rosie (Sharon Stone), hoping to give her some illicit pictures taken long ago (from the long-ago secret, of course). Why? I don't know. Does Vinnie think Rosie will be so grateful to get those pictures back (which involve her and a crooked race commissioner, played in the present by Albert Finney) that she'll leave her husband and hitch up with Vinnie? Picture Nick Nolte looked as disheveled as he did in Down and Out in Beverly Hills. That's kind of how attractive he was in Simpatico. Quite a visual, isn't it?\n\nI think there was supposed to be a cat-and-mouse thriller, but there's no suspense, and therefore no thrills. You take seedy characters, add improbable circumstances and unbelieveable dialog, and you have yourself a recipe for ennui, a real nadir for all involved. Neither of the two males leads is particularly effective, but what was with billing Stone as highly as she was? She doesn't even make an appearance until the movie's about two-thirds over, and even then her performance isn't very good, either. But then again, no one had a decent script with which to work, leaving them to mouth badly written lines."}

The Big Kahuna - on whom the fortunes of their company rests. Should they land the contract with this mysterious bigwig, their company will prosper. If they don't land the contract, of course, then they're all sunk.\nLarry (Kevin Spacey) and Phil (Danny DeVito) are the salesmen, and Bob (Peter Facinelli) is the marketing guy. Bob's a rookie, and Larry and Phil try to prep him for handling himself with potential customers. They've rented the hospitality suite in the hotel to entertain their clients and are planning on having a small party, hoping that the Big Kahuna will show up. No, it's not Waiting for Godot, but it's along those lines.\n\nThis is basically a character study. There's a lot of dialog - virtually the entire movie takes place in the suite, with only a few very minor scenes outside it - and each word is absolutely dripping with meaning. There aren't any throwaway lines in this movie, folks. Most movies contain generic lines that would fit in any similar movie. Not this one. If you're a fan of well-written movies, this is a prime example of how one should be constructed.\nBut with such an emphasis on the dialog, there's naturally little action. This is always a problem with movies based on plays. They come off restrained, stagey, and claustrophobic. But the lack of action actually gives the viewer the opportunity to watch two decidedly different acting styles. Spacey is bombastic, punctuating each syllable with a sneer or a rant. DeVito, on the other hand, is more reserved and appears wizened as a result. Each actor turns in a stunning performance, with Spacey basically reprising the role he played in Glengarry Glen Ross. The only one who seems out of place is Facinelli, who is ineffective as Bob the marketing guy.\nThe Big Kahuna is compelling, as long as you don't mind talky comedy-dramas."}

You've seen it. Of course, Event Horizon wasn't all that wonderful either, but it's not much different than this mishmash of overbaked sci-fi hyperbole.\nBut for those of you who didn't see Event Horizon - and I suspect that's a lot of you - here's your basic plot. Rescue vessel Nightingale, drifting rather aimlessly through space, receives a mysterious, distant distress call. Who has sent it? Is there free beer on board? So many questions. Bear in mind there are hardly any distress calls in deep space movies that are neither distant nor mysterious. So we're already mired in the muck of overdone drivel. Star Trek was here before, but even it wasn't the first. No, you'd have to go back to the earliest days of the caveman, when Og looked up at the skies and told his kids a yarn about how some peabrains on a spaceship answered a distress call.\nAnd of course, when they answer the call, there's gonna be problems. Like their ship falling apart. Like them finding an injured man and taking him on board (always a no-no, it seems, in these movies). And like the members of the crew being plucked off, one by one, like birds on a wire. It's like Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None, only instead of guns and knives, people die in much more fascinating ways, like floating in space, and none of the characters has a British accent. Same concept, though.\nAs for the cast, Angela Basset's in this - how far she's come/fallen since When a Man Loves a Woman! - and so is James Spader. And so is Lou Diamond Phillips - what is this, an 80's reunion? Where's Ally Sheedy? Where's Andrew McCarthy? The actors are given little to say or do that's of any substance; they all take a back seat to the effects, which truly are special. \nSo bottom line for you, folks - not a bad little movie, for what it is, which is a meaningless pile of pseudo-interesting junk. A good popcorn film, as they said in the old days. Not worth your seven bucks, but not bad for 2-for-1 night at the video store."}

He and his cellmate Nick each have plans of enjoying themselves once they get out of stir. Nick's involves meeting and spending the rest of his life with a woman he's never met, a pen pal named Ashley (Charlize Theron). Ah, but the best-laid plans and all that go horribly awry when Nick is slain a few days before they're both due to be sprung. What a coincidence! Naturally, Rudy pretends to be Nick to Ashley, discovering her to be quite the cutie. You see, he's just gotten out of prison, hasn't been with a woman in years, and.... Well, anyway, he hooks up with the gorgeous Ashley, and all is well - for a few hours, anyway, until Ashley's brother Gabriel (Gary Sinise) shows up and demands Rudy/Nicky help him and his gang - who have never robbed anyone - pull off a heist of a local Indian casino. Of course, Rudy, being Rudy and not Nick, doesn't know a thing about the casino (Nick was a guard there years ago). And he tries to tell Gabriel that. But wouldn't you know it, the creep just won't listen! (Bad guys are like that.) \nSo your basic plot involves Rudy trying to help/not help these guys with their evil plan, and of course they'll stop at nothing, and of course things go wrong, etc. Oh sure, there are a few plot twists, and some will have you guessing, but my bet is there's going to be a lot in this movie that you've seen before. And if you think the plot's relatively ho-hum, with few surprises, then you're left with the performances of the three main leads.\n\nBen Affleck is miscast, in my opinion. His character's not terribly likeable (I mean he DOES lie to Charlize Theron, after all), but that's not his fault. Affleck's problem is that he combines arrogance with tough-guy attitude and thinks it makes him multifaceted. No, Ben, it makes you look like a jerk. A better choice for this role might have been Edward Norton (Fight Club). Norton can play tough with foibles, and I don't think Affleck has that ability.\nCharlize Theron is outstanding. She delivers a deep, stunning performance that produces new wrinkles with each scene. Much like Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity, Theron is crafty, essaying more in those bewitching eyes than most actors can in an entire soliloquy.\nAnd Gary Sinise? He's Gary Sinise. He's sinister, he's mean-spirited....he's the heavy. He's the bad guy, folks, and Sinise has played this role a few times, so he knows what he's doing. Oh sure, maybe his character is nothing more than a cardboard Bad Guy role, but hey, that's more the fault of the screenwriting than it is of the actor, so I won't blame him. I've seen his talent range, and I know he's got some. (See Of Mice and Men or The Green Mile or Ransom.)\nBottom line - it's not exactly filled with the kind of twists that'll keep you guessing, but it's not too bad. It is, however, a bit of a comedown from the director of The Manchurian Candidate. But fret not, friends - it is, after all, a rental at this point, and it's worth the $3.50 or so."}

Rubin's learned his life lessons at the proverbial school of hard knocks, mostly at the hands of racist police officers in his home town of Paterson, New Jersey. But, being the tough I-can-take-on-the-world kind of guy he is, he fights his way through the hatred and perseveres to become welterweight champ. And all is going well until one night when Carter is arrested and charged with the murders of four innocent people. With a checkered past that includes problems with white authorities, Carter is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment.\n\nCarter tries to appeal his case, but to no avail. Many people rally to his defense, including celebrities. Nothing. Sixteen years later, Hurricane is still in stir. Three Canadians decide to pick up his case:  Terry Swinton, Lisa Peters, and Sam Chaiton, who vow to free Carter.\nOn the surface, you might dismiss this as another put-upon-man-fights-back-against-all-and-triumphs-over-bad-due-to-the-strength-of-his-heart kind of movie. And the fact that this is a true story would tend to make you think, \"Oh, well of course he triumphs, otherwise they wouldn't be making a movie out of it!\" But let me warn you here: Please don't make such sweeping assumptions about this masterpiece.\nThere are times, during the early part of this movie, during the childhood years and early adulthood years of Carter, that one gets a sense that they've seen this before. Those times are slowly erased when  the film turns from being a standard biopic to being a taut, tender courtroom drama. And if you think there's no such beast as a \"tender\" courtroom drama, then friends you have not seen this movie.\nThis is a powerful film. It first lulls you with that sense of sameness from the early Carter days then smacks you upside the head with an ending that, while predictable (it IS a true story, of course) is so emotionally charged and magnificently acted that there is simply no way you can walk away from it without feeling something. There's a lot to be said for a movie that can do all that despite being so factual and almost antiseptic. Sure, anytime the good guys win you're more apt to have a tear running down your face, but this movie seems to transcend all of that. \nWashington himself turns in perhaps the best performance of his entire career, and considering the accolades this man has generated in his nearly 20-year career, that's no small feat. Even with a murmur, Washington can essay such passion to raise the eyes of even the most downtrodden lost soul. He is the magnet in this film, the movie's draw, but he's not the only one performing so well. Each of the Canadians who fight for him are a real treat to watch, especially the talented Deborah Unger as Lisa Peters. Add to all of this the superb, experienced direction of Norman Jewison, and my friends, you have yourselves a masterpiece."}

Director Paul Thomas Anderson's last movie, Boogie Nights, examined the seemly underbelly of the pornography business (okay, so maybe there isn't another kind) while making all of his characters real. He attempts the same kind of reality with Magnolia, but the results are a lot spottier and unsatisfying.\nThe centerpiece of the movie is Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise), a motivational speaker/showman whose act is aimed squarely at the macho, testosterone-laden male on a quest to bed down with every attractive woman he can get his hands on. Frank's real successful with his career, and the movie takes us through a typical presentation of his act to a small crowd. While this is going on, several other scenes are taking place, including a quiz show pitting adults against kids, a dying old man (Jason Robards), the breakdown of the old man's younger wife (Julianne Moore), an inept and thickheaded cop (John C. Reilly), and a miserable former child star (William H. Macy). You may note that some of those actors also appeared in Boogie Nights. The cast is well-picked, to be sure, but sadly almost every performance is overblown and overstated. (Except, of course, for the dying Robards.)\nAt over 3 hours long, Magnolia would test anyone's patience. But really, even if it had been chopped in half (thus eliminating a lot of superfluous plot), the result probably wouldn't have been much better. In some cases, a shorter movie means more confusion; but with so many characters and so many things happening to each one, this was far more complicated than it needed to be. The end result is that the viewer wonders what the point is.\nCruise was nominated for an Oscar for his work here, but I don't think it's even among his best work (Born on the Fourth of July still is). If you're a female, you'll easily be turned off by his character's opinions and actions; and if that's the point, it's a badly illustrated point. And really none of the other characters stands out as a fine performance. In fact, because Anderson's characters don't seem all that real to us - and this is achieved because they're one-dimensional - the viewer will likely lose interest in their plights. Let's face it, if a character doesn't appeal to you, you don't care what he or she does or what happens to them. Writers have to learn to establish character appeal. This doesn't mean the character has to be a nice person, just interesting. Give your audience a reason to care!\nOh, and don't get me started on over-emoting. When it's not Cruise screaming into a cell phone, it's Moore in a drug-addled craze screeching at her lawyer. Ho-hum, ho-hum.\nI will say this much for the movie, though. The ending is NOT to be believed, and I mean that in a good way. Almost makes up for the first 170 minutes.  This is a mix of acting badly and badly acting. Skip it."}

Should he be a dashing hero, or a romantic lead? For any newly minted Hollywood star, the next role or roles are exceedingly crucial. The follow-up to a blockbuster doesn't have to make as bombastic a splash as its predecessor, but it can't get by with just a ripple, either.\nSo what does the so-called \"King of the World\" choose to do? This adaptation of Alex Garland's novel about a young lost soul who wants to get more out of life and finds an island paradise in the South Pacific. Remember how Lord of the Flies was? Well, if you had any English in high school or college, you'll remember that the setting there was an island where prep-school boys had crashlanded. And all goes well, until they submit to their base instincts and become savages. When Richard (DiCaprio) and his friends find this island, that movie/book was the first thing I thought of. It's all there - the rituals, the diversions, the bonding-through-suffering. And it's all very, very well photographed, too. In fact, the more I looked at the island, the more it looked like the one in Survivor on CBS, only with fewer rats and a whole heaping helping of marijuana. Seems the people on the island are basically self-sufficient, leaving the world behind and taking care of themselves, save for occasional forays back to the mainland for goods they can't get on their own island.\nThis movie just solidifies the old theory that says if you take a mediocre actor and put him in a BIG MOVIE, where the BIG special effects are the main draw, he'll do just fine; put him in a movie where he actually needs to ACT, and he's not so hot. DiCaprio's character isn't particularly nice, which is fine; but he's also played in a hopeless, one-dimensional way, with a careless - not necessarily carefree - attitude. I'm sure DiCaprio is a good guy; at least I have no evidence to the contrary. But in this film, there simply isn't any THERE there. His character, essential to the plot, since he's the protagonist, is about as effective as the proverbial puptent in a windstorm.\nIt goes without saying that DiCaprio got script approval, too - coming off Titanic, and all - since he seems to be able to bed down with practically every female in the movie. Which is kind of eerie, since to me he looks about 12 years old. But hey - some people seem to think he's hot stuff. Oh, and despite a lot of swimming and rain, Leo's hair never seems to move much, but maybe I'm just nitpicking.\nAs for the plot - well, like most of the dung floating on the big screens these days, you should be able to predict it all the way through. Some of the actions of these islanders will leave you scratching your head. If this is what would happen in a paradise setting with so-called 'civilized' people, I'll take savage headhunting tribes any day.\nI won't lay all of the blame on poor Leo. The acting is absolutely wretched, and the whole time I'm watching this dreck I'm wondering why these infantile boobs were even STAYING on the island. I know, that's a slap at the screenwriting as much as at the acting. But aside from the magnificent scenery, this is a virtually unwatchable movie.\nYour best bet is to simply skip this yawner and check out Survivor itself. At least there the actions and reactions are a little more realistic - although, knowing how well-staged that show is, maybe not all THAT realistic."}

What to do, what to do. Henpecked by his sexy, meanspirited wife (Rosanna Arquette), Oz (Perry) travels from his Canadian home to Chicago to find out if there's a finder's fee for The Tulip, who's on the lam from some ornery mobsters (led by a ineffectual Kevin Pollak). And it's there where he runs into Jimmy's wife (Natasha Henstridge). And you can kind of see where it all goes from here.\n\nOh sure, they try to make the plot complicated, but if you have the IQ of a gnat (as well as the attention span), chances are you'll be correctly predicting scenes well before they arrive. The plot is essentially contrived to the max, with carbon-copy characters that are buoyed only by the actors' performances. It's a comedy, to be sure, but it's simply not a very good one. This isn't a non-stop laughter kind of movie - it does have its good lines, but they're about as frequent as an on-key Rosanne rendition of the Star-Spangled Banner.\nPerry is amazingly miscast as Oz the Dentist; he's bland, uninspiring, and practically melts into the background. For a dentist whose first scene has him showing off his dazzling smile, he hardly ever smiles the whole rest of the movie! (And yes, this IS a comedy!). By contrast, Willis effectively underplays his role as the itinerant mobster. Unlike Stallone, Schwarzenegger, et al, Willis is perfectly willing to shed his tough-guy-as-hero image to play other roles. He takes on supporting roles, he takes on self-deprecating roles, and he does it all with style and verve. Willis can even get his point across while hardly raising his voice above a whisper - try THAT, Stallone (see Over the Top)!\nNow, if you're a guy, you'll be happy to know there are plenty of hot women in here, and one even gets partially naked. And the men all have guns and talk tough - except for Oz, of course. (It's kind of like Mickey Blue Eyes, except without the effortless wit of Hugh Grant.)\nDespite the billing, it's Willis' show all the way. He's not a nice guy - he's a KILLER! - but despite his foibles, he's still the man in charge. Perry, on the other hand, is a weenie, but he can't even play one effectively. I found him to be boring and rather annoying. (Note to Matthew - GET A NEW AGENT! You need to be in ensemble movies; you're definitely not the leading man type.) So the biggest virtue of this movie is the performance of Willis - if you're a fan of his work, you'll enjoy his playful sendup of his own tough-guy characters."}

No wait, that's Wall Street. Ok, it's the same basic plot, without the style but with the same lack of substance. See if you can follow this oh-so-complex plot. Young man (Giovanni Ribisi) has overbearing father. Young man is caught running illegal casino games at college and gets recruited into super-elite stockbrokage firm (oooooh, how ominous!). Boy starts at the bottom - hey, gotta learn the ropes! - but gradually makes mucho bucks. Young man gets self-respect, hopes to get same from overbearing father. Then young man learns it's all very illict and begins to suffer a major fall from grace.\nGot all that? The same secret brotherhoods at work in Wall Street, Fight Club, and many other cheapo knockoffs is the moving force here, with enough testosterone to feed a boatload of five-star generals. Don't get me wrong, there's a place for these kinds of movies; it's just not on my TV screen. And with all the raging hormones floating about, there's just enough room for a quiet emoting scene between no-longer-idealistic young man and overbearing papa. Ho-hum. Let me get my hankie; the tough little kid's gonna spring a leak.\nI don't want to seem hard-headed or callous, but this is a film that tries alternately to swim in machismo and wallow in self-pity. It's not a pleasant film in any regard. Ribisi is very good in the lead, with just the right amount of wide-eyed optimism you'd expect from someone entering the brokerage industry, but nearly everyone around him is a laughable caricacture. What the producers saved on screenwriting they probably blew on looks - the mostly male cast is young, attractive, and swaggering."}

Well wouldn't you know it! He's having so much darn much fun, living his own vida loca and all, that he doesn't want to come back to the States with Dickie. But hold on! Dickie suddenly doesn't want Tom hanging around so much. Oh, and Tom's falling for Dickie's gorgeous girlfriend Marge (the sumptuous Gwyneth Paltrow), and he's also finding out more about Dickie than he wanted to know.\nHow much you enjoy this film does not depend on how much you identify with Tom Ripley. There's certainly a lot more to him than meets the eye, and this is evident from the very first scene. He's a mysterious, ambiguous character - in more ways than one. In fact, the most compelling aspect of this movie is that you never truly know Tom Ripley's motivation. You don't know what makes him tick. You don't know, above all, what in the world he's going to do next. That's not an easy feat for a screenwriter to accomplish, but Minghella (who adapted the novel) does just that. I really was on the edge of my seat wondering where the story was going to end up. That's a major plus in this day of carbon-copy scripts."}

George Clooney being a manly man, gritting his pearly whites and saving lives. Hey, this ain't E.R, folks. This is a real-life action drama.\nYou may have heard of the \"Storm of the Century\" that smacked into New England in 1991. You might also have heard of the Andrea Gail, a small fishing boat caught smack dab in the middle of it. Of course, you might also have watched the documentary on MSNBC before this movie aired, and therefore you know the ending anyway. Luckily for me, I kept myself ignorant (a planned action, I assure you!), and had no idea what the end result was for this movie. And no, I'm not going to tell you the ending. Sure, I know, it's not exactly a twist ending, and you could find out on your own if you wanted. So go ahead, find out. We critics don't give away endings. It's part of the Critics Society secret waiver we signed.\nAnyway, here's the tale in a nutshell. Billy Tyne (Clooney) is a grizzled fishing-boat captain who pilots the Andrea Gail, owned by Bob Brown (Michael Ironside). Seems Billy's had a run of bad luck lately, and when he and rival fisherman Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio, not too far from \"The Abyss\") return from a run, he's the one with the lesser load. Gritting those teeth and raising a fist, Billy returns to the deep a scant two days after leaving it, determined to find some damn fish.\nHis plan is to go further than usual. I'm no cartographer, but I can tell you his plan was to go a ways, then go further than that, because that's where the fish are, by gum. So our old salt rallies his crew together, and off they go. And fish they catch! Big ones, and of course there's the requisite crewmen-who-don't-like-each-other, and a nasty old shark, and all sorts of hilarious hijinks, just the sort of stuff you'd expect to see (no pun intended) in a movie about deep-sea fishing.\nSo they have the fish, and they're heading back home, and they're so damn happy, and WHAM! They find out they're heading into a big ol' horkin' storm. You've seen the commercials - this is what it's all leading up to. So they have a choice - turn around and go the long way (and lose their fish, which would spoil) or go through that nasty old storm? Guess which one Billy wants to do.\nAmong the other cast members, Mark Wahlberg does a solid, commanding job as greenhorn Bobby Shatford and John C. Reilly is a treat as veteran sailor Murph. Karen Allen and Diane Lane are relegated to small, thankfless roles.\nAr, ar, me hearties! Batten down yer masts! See Clooney rage madly at the storm like King Lear! Hey, look, folks, it's simple. You wanna see George Clooney be a tough guy? Here's your movie. You want a story and believable characters? Go see Yentl. I almost thought the sea was full of testosterone, since these guys seemed to be swimming in it. So pack up your grunts and belches, and have a blast with this escapist movie!"}

The plots of those old Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons were tantalizingly simple. Helium-voiced Rocket J. Squirrel and terminally stupid Bullwinkle J. Moose had all the sense of an Eskimo in a desert sandstorm, but the cartoons were loaded with adult-oriented jokes (Veronica Lake??) that would please Mom and Dad, while the kids were easily hooked on the appropriately cartoonish violence.\nThere have been movies that have taken old-time cartoons and made them - or tried to - into live-action films. This doesn't always work. Sure, The Flintstones was a good-enough movie, but what about the more recent Flintstones movie in Las Vegas? The creators of this movie tried the same thing, and they even made Rocky and Bullwinkle trying to adapt to the 'real world' - that is, they knew the difference between their cartoon home in Frostbite Falls, Minnesota and three-dimensional life.\n\nBasic plot: Fearless Leader and company have left the cartoon world and are going to take over the real world. Whoa, THAT sounds familiar. So an intrepid, young, cute FBI agent (Piper Perabo, miscast and unnecessary) is assigned to the case by her boss (Randy Quaid, misused), and it's up to her and the cartoon moose and squirrel to right the wrongs of the day.\nI will say this much for the movie - aside from the now ho-hum special effects of making the cartoon animals seem real - it seems to stay pretty close to the spirit of the original. There are in-jokes (Nickelodean's Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchel play \"Martin and Lewis\" - Dean and Jerry, anyone?) and some fun cameos that don't detract from the movie itself. But it's nothing more than a road movie with a little panache. The saddest thing is that the movie becomes less about Rocky and Bullwinkle as icons and more about the superfluous FBI agent. It seems like there were several writers in on this escapade, but only one (Ken Lonergan) is listed - either he's REALLY schizophrenic, or the other writers wisely decided to be anonymous.\nThere's also leaden pacing in some parts, not to mention a real herky-jerky filming style. Oh, but all is not lost. I DID laugh a lot. Ok, maybe not a lot, but some. It's just an uneven movie - sometimes you laugh, and sometimes you sit there in silence. All in all, it's not as good as the original, but since that almost never happens, you might walk away from it almost satisfied."}

That's the heart of Road Trip, this year's American Pie.\n\nOh sure, there's a lot of salty language. Oh yes, and some damn good nakedness too. And there's fun with animals, and voyeurism, and frat parties, and anal pleasures, and more nakedness, and...and...and...\nOoops! Sorry, got carried away for a moment there. Not everyone's going to like this movie, but I sure did. While I watched it in the theatre, I actually said to the guy next to me, \"This is the funniest movie I have ever seen.\" Well, I might have exaggerated that a little bit, but there are a lot of masterfully funny scenes. \nSo what's the plot, anyway? Seems Josh made a pact with his girlfriend to not see other people while each is away at college - and they're not at the same college, either. Well, here it is, the end of the semester, and poor Josh is weakening. When E.L. throws a massive end-of-the-year party, Josh goes and has a wild time with a gorgeous, sensitive, damn-fine-catch named Beth. Which wouldn't be so bad, maybe, except Beth wanted to VIDEOTAPE it. And that in itself might not be so bad, either (you kind of have to leave your morals at the door here, folks), except Josh has been sending these \"I Love You\" (no, not the virus) videos to his geographically displaced sweetie. And earlier in the day, he had been taping just such a message, then asked his pal Rubin to mail it for him when it rewound, since he (Josh) was late for class. Well - enough exposition - you can see what happened! Rubin mailed the illicit Beth video!\nAnd there you have the premise of this Road Trip. You see, Josh's darling doesn't go to a local school - he's in a school on Long Island, New York; she's in Texas. So Josh decides to drive there. You may ask, as pal E.L. did, why not fly? Well hey, we're talking college kids here. They don't exactly have the disposable income of a plane ticket. So off he goes, in a car provided by another pal, the geeky Kyle, and accompanied by E.L. and Rubin.\nSo what develops is an endless supply of hilarious I-Love-Lucy situations, the kind of situations that normally seem incongruous with real life. You know - something wacky happens, then something WACKIER happens, and you see this in a movie and think, \"Hey! That would NEVER happen in real life! This movie sucks!\" And you know what? A lot of the stuff that happens to our fearless foursome does seem awfully odd; but oddly enough, it doesn't seem contrived. I could actually picture a lot of that happening to me.\n\nOh, I knew there was something else I needed to mention - Tom Green's in this. If you're a fan of his show, you'll enjoy his completely deranged performance. If you're not a fan, you'll still love it. Green seems to fit in perfectly in this movie, with those doleful eyes belying a sensitive wit and razor-sharp mind.\nIf you watch this movie, prepare to laugh your <bleeping> ass off. But only if you're open-minded about it. Then again, I guess there won't be too many straightlaced, proper-and-prim folks in the theater ogling all the hot women in the movie, either.

But of course, there are complications. They've been friends for many years, although they've never fought each other in the ring. Oh, and they both dated the same woman (Lolita Davidovich), who drives them both to Vegas - and dumps Cesar on the way!\nHalf of this movie is spent showing the guys traveling to Vegas from Los Angeles, squabbling along the way, picking up a slutty ingenue (Lucy Liu), and half is spent actually fighting the fight. I guess the reason for this is so there can be all sorts of suspense and tension built up during the road trip, as years of pent-up frustration can sufficiently simmer for the allegorical fight in the ring. \nHow much you enjoy this film will depend on a few variables - your tolerance for the cinematic stylings of Harrelson and Banderas, your affinity for pro boxing, and your love of violence in sport. It's often been said that there's a certain poetry to boxing, an art form in which the medium is blood and fists, but this film, for all of its slow-motion camerawork, doesn't exactly evoke comparisons to ballet. \nI can't say that the acting is magnificent, because the actors don't act as much as they simply exist. The two male leads are very appealing in this light comedic romp, and they both play off Davidovich's character perfectly. There's plenty of sexual tension during the drive to Vegas, and that's a testament to the three main characters. The only debit is Liu's annoying skank - she wasn't very necessary and detracted from the story a little too much."}

Especially if they're not sure they want to be a boy. Brandon (Hillary Swank) has a sexual identity problem. She's female, but she desperately wants to be a male. She cuts her hair short and picks up women in honkytonk bars in Lincoln, Nebraska as a way of dealing with her emotional problems. Of course, this sets her up for endless persecution by local rednecks (this movie does nothing to eliminate standard hillbilly/small-town stereotypes), and poor Brandon Teena (or Teena Brandon, her real name) suffers tremendous mental and physical anguish at the hands of those less understanding.\nBrandon's travails take her to Falls City, where she meets Lana (Chloe Sevigny, late of Kids) and Candace (Alicia Goranson). Brandon hangs out with her new friends, who also include Tom (Brendan Sexton III) and John (Peter Sarsgaard). They drink, they party, they try to outrun the cops in a mid-70's Nova, and pretty much play the roles of Young People Gone Bad. How much you like these characters might depend on how much you identify with them - picture the gang from The Outsiders, for example. There's not much original in these amoral, hell-raising characters; they paint a pretty ugly picture of small-town people. Think your family has problems? Just about every vice and bad character trait is evident in these people, probably doing more to lower outsiders' opinions of rural America than any in any film in recent memory.\nNeedless to say, Brandon doesn't tell anyone she's female right away, which means that in true Hollywood fashion, those very same people who she's come to know and trust - and yes, even love - aren't going to be as trusting when they find out she's female, rather than male. Haven't we seen that a few times before? She can't very well tell anyone right from the start, because then she runs the risk of their ridicule before they get a chance to know her. Ah, but this is a movie, even if it IS based on fact. So when she DOES have to tell them she's a girl, of course most of them react rather negatively. And because this is a stereotypical small town, they react violently, too. I think I saw this before, when the movie was called Frankenstein.\nSome of the persecution Brandon undergoes is a bit overdone, too - did we REALLY need a protracted, graphic rape scene? I realize that sometimes the audience needs to be shocked in order to be convinced of the character's appeal, but this scene occurred rather late in the film, and by then the audience really should be on the lead character's side.\nAnd that brings up another little issue - the motivation of Brandon. I do understand that this is a person (based on a real-life person, too) who is completely at odds with herself - she has the female parts, but longs to be male - and that conflict causes her to seek pleasure and pain simply to survive. But most of her problems in this film are brought on by her own actions. It's not as if Brandon is simply trying to fit in with the rest of the world - she actually pushes the envelope, almost challenging herself to survive, trying to see how far she can go before someone finds out. This isn't a story of someone with  a troubled past simply wanting to move on; this is a story of someone who's a little different than everyone else, and wants to challenge herself, who almost dares others to discover her secret.\n\nDon't misunderstand me - this is a fine film, but it has its bad points, too. The first three-quarters of the film are riveting, although sometimes tough to watch. But the last quarter descends into a standard movie-of-the-week treatment of a pretty serious subject, and generally every character becomes a caricature. I watched countless stereotypes and cliches walk across my screen during that last quarter. It's almost as if the screenwriters took an extended coffee break and someone from USA Networks filled in.\nAnother problem is the casting. Hilary Swank turns in some magnificent work (and really deserved her Oscar), but her casting was puzzling, at least from a physical standpoint. When she cuts her hair short in her guy-disguise, that's about as male as she looks. For the bulk of the movie - in full guy-mode - she basically looks like someone's underfed sister. She's skinny and with a gigantic mouth. (And I saw her at the Oscars in female-mode - she's really VERY attractive.) To me, she really didn't look all that male - she just looked young. Now, I'm not sure what else the makers of this movie could have done to make Swank look more masculine, and of course this is based on a true story. Certainly, given the physical limitations of the role, Swank did a remarkable job.\nAll in all, it's a good movie, thought-provoking at times. It's just a shame so many white-trash stereotypes had to be thrown in there as well!"}

To begin with, there are millions of people who have never heard of Andy Kaufman, so there's a entire demographic that would need to be taught about the late auteur. Right away, when you have to convince a large portion of the population that the subject of your movie is worthy of your cinematic paintbrush, you're in a hole that most moviemakers can't dig out of. \nBut that's only the people who weren't aware of Andy Kaufman when he was alive. What about those of us who were? Those who closely followed the television series Taxi remember the character of Latka Gravas, but how many people paid any attention to Kaufman's offscreen antics? Those who did notice generally seem to fall into one of two categories: those who loved Kaufman and believed him to be an unsung comic genius, and those who despised him and saw him as a relentlessly weird pathological  liar.\n\nThose who loved Kaufman and his work might find something of value in this film. As a straight biography, there are inspired, original moments - such as the beginning acting as an end, or some of Kaufman's bits (including the legendary Saturday Night Live \"Mighty Mouse\" skit) - but most of the movie is rather pedestrian, given that it's directed by Milos Forman, who brought One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to the big screen. Our Hero struggles against People Who Don't Understand Him (parents, audiences) until he is saved by a Nice Agent With a Heart of Gold who shows him the way to superstardom. Ho-hum. The viewer, instead of being enticed by this purportedly unique, larger-than-life character, finds that it's really just an exercise in somnolence. The script is smarmy and self-satisfied, as if it's telling it's damn funny and if you want to be hip, you'll think it's funny, too.\nJim Carrey, as Andy, turns in some remarkable work, but thanks to a rather standard script doesn't really get to show off his acting chops (which we saw in The Truman Show). As Andy, Carrey turns in a good impersonation, but not a full characterization. Courtney Love as Andy's girlfriend Lynne isn't exceptional, but the character lacks depth. She's no more or less important than Adrian from Rocky, cheering her man on through thick and thin, leaving him at one point but - surprise - coming back to him when he needs her the most. Danny DeVito is his agent, George, and he's likeable in a thankless role (remember Edward Norton in The People Versus Larry Flynt?).\n\nLike Oliver Stone's The Doors, we come away from this movie not knowing much more about the lead character than we did before the movie. There are no deep insights, no real secrets revealed. The result is a slipshod, lackadaisical film, a movie that promises to bring the story of a 'misunderstood' man to light but winds up being a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing."}

Zion, Wisconsin in 1994. Alvin Straight, 73 years old, is a physical wreck of man. He needs two canes to get around. He can't drive due to poor eyesight. But his estranged brother has just suffered a debilitating stroke, and Alvin is determined to go see him. Since he can't drive, and since he'll be damned if he'll let someone in a bus drive him there, Alvin chooses the mode of transportation he knows best - a 1966 John Deere riding mower. This is such an odd movie for a filmmaker like David Lynch to make. The creator of such cultish films as Eraserhead, Dune, and Blue Velvet generally makes weird, offbeat movies. His films are usually rated R (or worse), and are brimming with stylish violence and a real sense of atmosphere, creepy as it may be. With The Straight Story, none of these characteristics are apparent. I half-expected to see Alvin turn into a homicidal maniac who likes to lop off ears and drink the blood out of them in a crazed, stylish, symbolistic dance. But no, this was as gentle, as moving a movie as you'll see nowadays (aside from certain made-for-cable movies). There isn't an ounce of meanness, not a whit of wickedness, not one dollop of demonic possession. It's as placid as a quilting bee, and what's more, it's absolutely beautiful. If you've seen any of Lynch's movies, you know the director has his own trademark  camera angels and movements, and these are unmistakable in this film, as well. From each loving look at the amber waves of grain (okay, maybe they're golden) to the stark farmhouses poised in repose, each camera angle seems to have been painstakingly tended to. There's love in the details, friends, and this is one of those rare, rare movies that'll stay in your mind for years. And to top if all off, you have an Oscar-nominated performance from Richard Farnsworth, a former stuntman-turned-thespian. There's hardly an emotion from cranky old Alvin Straight for most of the film, the repressed WWII vet on a mission. The casting couldn't have been better in this movie. Farnsworth is an absolute delight as Alvin, and his eyes are more revealing than the faces of many well-paid actors. Tired, wrinkly, and a little despondent, Alvin's eyes express everything from sadness to resignation to resilience. The moment when Alvin finally reaches his brother's house is very memorable, the kind film scholars should be talking about for decades."}

When the screenwriter and the director collaborated on 1976's Taxi Driver with Robert DeNiro, they examined the underbelly of the city as seen through the eyes of a psychotic cabbie. With Bringing Out the Dead, they examine the underbelly of the city as seen through the eyes of a slowly unraveling paramedic. But don't worry folks, it's not the same movie at all!\nNicholas Cage, who by now has \"How to Play a Burned-Out Character\" soldered onto his brain, plays Frank Pierce, an EMS who is haunted by visions of people he couldn't save. Cage's facial expressions careen wildly from wide-eyed, goofy grins to mopey, woe-is-me blank stares. Frank Cage isn't a character as much as he's an amalgam of all that's wrong and right about the seamy side of every city in the world. He's a zombie driving the streets at night, waiting for tragedy. And he's been able to push away all of the reality and concentrate on just the saving of lives. Until now, anyway - one girl with whom Frank grew up in the neighborhood slowly degenerated into a drug user/addict, and Frank always seems to feel some sort of remorse for her death. Why her, and no one else, is a mystery.\nAmong the characters (not people, characters) that Frank encounters during a 48-hour period are Mary Burke (Patricia Arquette), whose father Frank brought into the hospital. Mary, an emotional shell much like Frank, is clearly in the movie only to serve as a romantic foil to Frank. Perhaps not too coincidentally, Mary seems to run into Frank an awful lot, so it's no real shock to find out Frank has eyes for her. And that's all well and good, because a movie that wallows so much in its own self-perpetuated malestrom of depravity needs a female presence to kind of balance it all out, as if one extra shot of estrogen will offset the testosterone-laden atmosphere. Sadly, it does not. Mary doesn't rise above the decadence and seediness of the city; she is merely immersed by it. Even worse than the one-dimensional characterization, however, is the flat delivery by Arquette. No master thespian she, Arquette speaks each line in such a dull monotone that you want to slap her just to get her out of the rut she's in. That kind of delivery makes sense when you first meet Mary, because she's in shock from her dad going into cardiac arrest. But there's no need for her to keep that up. \nSo what exactly is the point of this movie? That the city can be a nasty, dangerous place? That bad things can happen? That drugs are evil? Wow, such profound thoughts! Let me write these down. If you're looking for pearls of wisdom, try another movie. If you're looking for searing action, this might work for you, but it's sort of a tempered but of action."}

He's forty-something, has a successful job, a pretty wife, and a loving daughter. Or does he? As he examines his life, he notices there's less and less joy in it as the years go by. He also mopes about it a lot, wondering just when it was that the living disappeared from his life. The sex has vanished from his marriage to strong-willed real-estate agent Carolyn (Annette Bening), and his daughter Jane (Thora Birch) detests him. And poor Lester's just stumbling through his dreamlike life, trapped in suburbia, when an encounter with his daughter's best friend Angela (Mena Suvari) wakes him out of his catatonia.\nLester can't keep his mind off Angela, a sexpot who wants to be a model someday. Angela's bossy, manipulative, tough, and very egocentric. She apparently keeps Jane around to make herself feel better and never tires of bragging of her own sexual exploits. Add to that personality an underage, nubile body, and Lester's hooked. When he overhears Angela say to Jane that Lester might be goodlooking if he worked out, Lester begins to pump iron in the garage. Next thing you know, he's smoking pot with the rebel next door (Wes Bentley), who has his OWN litany of psychosocial problems. And then it gets interesting!\nAlan Ball's script never lets up, and there are hardly any laggards among the actors, either. Spacey won an Academy Award for his skillful work as the demented, although not without logic, Lester. Lester's creepy - if you had him as a next-door neighbor and knew him well enough, you'd move yourself and your family to another state. Spacey paints Lester, however, not as a single-minded psychopath, but as a reasonable, self-sufficient, logical man who simply wants to revitalize his own existence. Having seen the movie, I simply can't picture another actor turning in this kind of performance. Spacey's characterization is a lot like a car wreck on the turnpike - you can't help but stop and look at it, although you feel guilty about liking what you see.\nAnnette Bening's no slouch either. The role of Carolyn is a difficult one, as she must appear both together and apart mentally. Her character is amazingly multilayered - she's not just a shallow, career-minded woman, she's a shallow, career-minded woman with emotional problems that could choke Freud. And Thora Birch (remember her as the little kid in Patriot Games?) is magnificent as Jane, the sullen daughter. It's not easy to capture the essence of being a teenager on film, and Birch comes closest than most. \nNeedless to say, the whole cast is top-notch, as is the direction. Bottom line - this is a creepy, unsettling, one-of-a-kind movie."}

I'm an actor, not a space commander!", "content": "For those of you who grew up watching the old Star Trek series, complete with cheesy special effects and wooden acting, or for those of you who have seen legions of Trekkies - either in person or on TV at one of those seemingly ubiquitous conventions - this movie just might strike a cord. In the movie, a long-ago TV show called Galaxy Quest rode the airwaves, starring Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver), and Sir Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman). After a short run, the series was cancelled (sound familiar?), but the legacy of the crew lives on in a neverending series of personal experiences. Sure, the ol' crew is a little long in the tooth, but hey, they need the money. It's at one of these conventions, though, that something odd happens. Seems these aliens beam down and tell Jason how much they admire his commander skills and that they need him post-haste to go monitor a peace accord with some mean, ugly aliens. Jason, naturally, thinks it's another publicity gig, but it turns out these are bona fide aliens, and it isn't long before Jason angers an evil alien despot. It's not long before he realizes those are real aliens, so he rounds up the crew from another promotional stop he had missed, and it's back to the ship for the adventure part of the tale. There are plenty of in-jokes to Trekkies (who aren't referred to as Trekkies in the movie, but all of the references are pretty thinly veiled. Galaxy Quest is a fun romp, poking fun at a subject that's certainly due for a poking - the lifestyle of all of the Star Trek-worshippers who attend their conventions with untethered glee, treating the long-ago actors as infallible angels. There are legions of fans who dissect each and every nuance of the Star Trek experience, from the personalities of the characters to the intricate technical details of the spaceships, and Galaxy Quest incorporates a lot of that lemming-like logic in this script.   As for the actors, all turn in fine work, with Allen and Weaver particularly appealing. Rickman is wonderfully cast as the snide doctor, a classically trained thespian who never tires of telling his fellow actors he once played Shakespeare."}

From Clerks to..Christ?", "content": "This offering from the director of Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy tackles a wide range of religious and social issues, but by no means can one write it off as a self-serious, pretentious epic.   The story tells of two fallen angels, Loki and Bartleby (played by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck), who have been suffering on Earth as immortals for many millenia after their expulsion from Heaven back in the old days. Suddenly, they've found a loophole in celestial logic that will allow them to return home to Heaven - through a church in (where else?) New Jersey. (And if you think entering Heaven through a church in NJ is weird enough, the two have been living all this time in Wisconsin.) While Loki and Bartleby are journeying from Wisconsin to New Jersey, Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) is visited by an angel - the Voice of God, actually - in the middle of the night in her bedroom. Voice (Alan Rickman) informs Bethany that she must journey to New Jersey to stop the angels from re-entering heaven, and that she will be aided in her quest by two prophets, that if the two angels re-enter Heaven, all reality will cease to be, and so on and so forth. Now you or I might be overwhelmed by such an outlandish request, and so is Bethany, but with a little prodding by Voice, she relents.\n And there's your plot, basically. Both the angels and Bethany are traveling to New Jersey (Red Bank, for those of you in the Garden State), although with different missions. Along the way, each runs into the requisite assortment of oddball characters. One of them is Rufus, the 13th Apostle (who claims he was left out of the Bible because he is black, and that Jesus Himself was black), played to the hilt by Chris Rock. Throw in George Carlin as a cardinal, Salma Hayek as another prophet, and Alanis Morrisette as God (don't worry, she doesn't speak, else your brain would melt and your heart would explode, or something like that), and you have one hell of a fun ride. Don't get me wrong, folks, this isn't a film of whimsey or non-stop mirth, but this is also not a overbearing, pompous, this-is-how-it-happened-and-damn-you-if-you-don't-believe-me kind of movie. In fact, although the closing scene isn't quite as good as the rest of the movie, this is one of the more intelligent films to come out in a while. One reason I feel this way is that there's hardly any plot contrivances - specifically, things tossed into the plot just for the sake of being there, rather than serving a purpose. Everything - and I mean everything - has an explanation. This is a movie that appears to have been pretty well-researched."}

For those of you who have been begging to see Brad Pitt at his toughest and grungiest, here's your movie! The film centers on a semi-secret group whose members pummel each other senseless (and senselessly) nightly in seedy basements. The club's leader, Tyler Durden, is a charismatic, Zen-conscious, manipulative misanthrope - and those are just some of his finer points. The film's protagonist, played by the talented Edward Norton, is a hopeless office-boy schlep stuck in a depressing, dead-end job, existing joylessly in a vanilla life that is supposed to signify the everyday lives of us regular folk. \nThe stark contrast in the two main characters is no accident, and we quickly come to realize that the narrator lives through Tyler vicariously, even as they both create Fight Club. What better way to learn about yourself and your fellow man than by engaging in a bare-knuckled bout of fisticuffs? Didn't these people ever hear of more conventional, less-painful methods such as primal scream or aspirin? \nSo what's the theme of this movie? Well, behind all the blood and guts, it's about finding oneself. It's about deciding whether to live your life as an ant performing the tasks of other ants or to live your life in ways that only your imagination can show you. I think it's also something about becoming a better person through violence, a theme we saw in A Clockwork Orange, way back when.\nThis is more than a mere fight movie, as its presumptuous theme indicates. Amazingly, with as much attention paid to the violence, there's actually room for a taut, creative script that's absolutely full of little nuggets of intelligence. This is a movie that beats you over the head with one theme (violence is good when used for self-improvement) while simultaneously sneaking in another, more clever theme. It's also got a fantastic twist right near the end, and if you see it coming - please shut up! The twist is reminiscent of another, even more popular movie (if I tell you which movie, then you'll more easily guess the secret), and if you're not looking for it - that is, if you're one of those who lets things happen in a movie, who doesn't try to guess each scene before it happens - you'll be shocked right out of your recliner. I finished watching this movie about half an hour ago, and I still feel a little uneasy - it can make that kind of impact on you."}

But five years ago we didn't have the kind of technical wizardry we have now; witness Toy Story, the new Star Wars, or any of the recent Disney films. Five years ago, the mouse would have been a regular rodent with a not-too-subtle voiceover. Remember Homeward Bound, the movie about the two dogs and the cat? There was no computer animation there, and you were basically left with three animals who appeared to cavort onscreen while some humans talked in the background. \nSo now here we have Stuart Little, a tiny little mouse (voiced by the always-fresh Michael J. Fox) who has lived his entire life in an orphanage. One day, the Littles (Hugh Laurie and Geena Davis) come to the orphanage looking for a brother for their young son George (Jonathan Lipnicki). Of course, with so many cute little boys and girls, it's impossible to choose - until they come across Stuart, who seems smart, funny, and wise beyond his years. George isn't too fond of Stuart at the start - he expected something a little... um, taller - but this is a kids' movie, after all, so eventually they bond as only a boy and his mouse brother can - by winning a boat race against a nasty bully.\nThere are a few storylines jammed into this 85-minute extravaganza. Stuart wants to learn about his natural parents, the family cat wants to kill him, and the parents want Stuart and George to get along. The way most of it plays out will come off as standard movie fare - predictable to those of us over 10, perhaps - but the winning charm of Fox as the loveable Stuart coupled with an engaging and appealing cast of characters makes up for any familiarity you might feel. On top of it all - the special effects. Now, I'm not one to heap overweening praise on special effects, but at no point during the viewing of this movie did I consider Stuart (or the cat, voiced by Nathan Lane) to be an artificial computer creation. Sure, you have to suspend belief a little bit for this movie, but hey - don't you have to do that with almost any movie, anyway?"}

Knowing the gold has been seized by Iraqi forces, making it war booty, and knowing that the Iraqis have recently surrendered, the four soldiers decide to take it for themselves in what seems to be a rather simple pickup. Led by Major Archie Gates (George Clooney, all grit, guts, and gleaming teeth), the group manages to infiltrate not one but two Iraqi bunkers in search of the gold. There's one problem however: Iraqi forces, already defeated by U.S. troops, have decided to take out their aggressions on their own citizens, and as our boys are leaving the village with the gold, Iraqi soldiers kill a few of the peasants. All hell breaks loose, and before you know it, several soldiers are dead and the peace treaty has been broken. An equal parts suspense thriller, war movie, and comedy, Three Kings never lets the viewer get too comfortable with the situation. You can't just settle in and figure this is another war movie, as the twists in John Ridley's story keep your mind moving. And to throw you off even more, there are some genuinely funny moments (such as when one Iraqi asks a U.S. soldier what Michael Jackson's deal is). To top it all off, this might be the first - and probably not the last - movie in history to show graphically what happens when a bullet enters a human body. That scene, while certainly not for the squeamish, nearly is worth the price of admission itself. Clooney is a rock as the leader, a man with shady intentions but with an otherwise impeccable conscience. After his group helps the peasants when they could have easily just left with the cache, with tragic consequences, Gates admits he may have made a bad decision, a true sign of humanity. This isn't some Napoleon suffering from overweening pride; this is a stolid soldier with blood on his hands, blood he knows he put there himself.\n As the young soldier with a young wife and a young child back home, Mark Wahlberg is appealing, a thoughtful soldier not prone to testosterone excess. He appears to be the smartest in the group, lacking only Gates' experience. One suspects that if Wahlberg's Troy Barlow were to stay in the military, he quickly would be promoted to a leadership capacity. But like many things in this movie, Barlow's character can't be painted with broad strokes. It takes a skilled actor to play such a layered character, and Wahlberg pulls the feat off. He's supported by Ice Cube as the tough Chief. Cube, one of the few rappers who can actually act, is also appealing, although his character lacks the intelligence (at times) of Barlow and the experience and leadership of Gates. The action here rarely pauses; it certainly doesn't pause long enough you to get too comfortable with it or to be able to predict what'll happen next. The direction is very well-paced; David O. Russell (who directed such comedies as Flirting with Disaster and Spanking the Monkey) does an admirable job blending aspects of a comedy, drama, war movie, and suspense thriller."}

His latest foray, For Love of the Game, doesn't quite approach the magnitude of those two; it's kind of a mixed bag. Costner plays Billy Chapel, a 40-year-old baseball pitcher at the end of a brilliant career. His team, the Detroit Tigers, has just been sold to corporate investors, and the old owner thinks it's time for Billy to call it a career. There's only one game left in what's been a miserable season for Detroit, against the dangerous New York Yankees, who can clinch their division with a victory. Chapel's on the mound of course, making what might be his final major league appearance. While Chapel pitches his game, scenes depicting his life up to that moment - specifically his relationship with Jane Aubrey (Kelly Preston), a magazine writer. Jane's beautiful and headstrong, but she and Billy have a love-hate relationship, since he is unable to love her more than the game of baseball. While Billy struggles on the mound, we see how their relationship develops, and the struggles he feels while pitching starkly mirror the tribulations of their relationship.   This is not an unflawed production, however. For one thing, Costner has been rumored for years to only cast women in his films who are either less-talented than he is (no mean feat!) or who are less overstated; in other words, actresses who may steal the film from him need not apply. Kelly Preston falls into the former of these two categories. There is no single scene in which Preston's Jane offers anything sincerity. I kept getting the feeling that he was acting - ok, I know, she IS acting, but it's not supposed to look like it! Preston's not terrible, but she would have looked a lot better if her male lead had been a little more commanding in his performance. The book on Costner for years has said that he's an actor who continuously underplays his roles. There isn't much expression on his face - which is getting more wrinkly by the second, it appears - has he ever heard of Retin-A? - and his emotions are about as deep as a shot glass. Maybe with a better actor, the overall affect of the movie would have been more pronounced. As it is, the movie's a little lackadasical. That said, the directing itself is masterful; Sam Raimi (known mostly for his Evil Dead movies!) shows off his talent in his most mainstream movie to date, and he is much more of an asset than Costner. So what else is wrong with it? Well, the film is manipulative to a degree - although if you allow yourself to be manipulated, I guess you're just as much to blame. I myself am proud to be manipulated! I say, \"Manipulate me, O Lords of Cinema!\" Even so, I felt a creeping feeling that my emotions were being toyed with. Did I really give a damn about these characters? Not when I saw how they behaved. Also, the score was a little presumptuous and overbearing. But that's just nitpicking."}

Homer Wells is given up by his natural parents as a baby, and for one reason or another is never adopted. Because of his long tenure at the orphanage, the home's good doctor (Michael Caine, who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his work here) teaches him how to be a doctor, and the two share many of the child-rearing duties at the orphanage. Assisted by Nurses Edna (Jane Alexander) and Angela (Kathy Baker), the duo perform countless deliveries of unwanted babies. There's a flip side to this issue, of course - the unwanted pregnancies that are aborted. Homer can't bring himself to perform the abortions, but Dr. Larch can. While the abortion issue isn't central to the plot of the movie, it is an integral piece to Homer's own coming-of-age. At some point, Homer must fly the coop and live life on his own, and here is where the comparisons to characters such as Forrest Gump or even Robin Williams' Garp come into play. Homer leaves the orphanage in due time, but he also leaves behind his family, including his fatherly superior, Dr. Larch, who loves the boy so much that he doesn't want him to go out into the world and be a failure when he knows Homer could stay at the orphanage and \"be useful.\" This sweeping tale checks in at over 2 hours, but it's not a yawner by any stretch. Homer is forthright, honest, and above all respectful, all qualities sadly lacking in many people today. (Luckily, this film takes place in the first half of the 20th century, so those characteristics don't seem out of place.) Caine is amazing in his role, completely dropping his famous Cockney accent in favor of a stentorial New England dialect. Once you get past hearing him sound like an American, you'll be fine - but it's a little jarring at first. One could almost make an argument that Caine could have been up for Best Actor, but this is clearly a movie about Homer, not Dr. Larch.   As for Maguire.... Well, there's something to be said for subtle performances, to be sure, but there's also something to be said about underplaying a roll too much. Maguire simply is miscast. He's earnest, but there's not much expression to be read on his face. To put it succintly, he's more than underwhelming in the lead role. The antithesis of Maguire is the lovely and VERY talented Charlize Theron, a young woman who comes to the orphanage to have an abortion. Theron is stunning, but what really grabs you is her magnificent, moving, and endearing performance. This is an actress to keep your eyes on, ladies and gentlemen. She's going to be a very hot commodity soon, even hotter than she is now."}

You wait, and you wait, and you wait for something, and inevitably it doesn't turn out to be nearly as good as you wanted it to be. The Phantom Menace is by no means a failure, but it does have some problems. Probably the best way to look at it is to compare it to other sci-fi films, not to other Star Wars movies. It's going to suffer in comparison to the others in the series, but it IS better than most of the sci-fi drek that's out there.\nIf you have not seen the first three (or is that the second three?) Star Wars movies, two things come to mind. First, WHY NOT? Second, you won't understand a lot of the nuances of this latest installment, in which case you shouldn't even bother with this review; you should check yourself into a halfway house that'll make you watch each Star Wars movie over and over again for 24 hours straight.\nNow, for those of you who did see the other movies, and somehow avoided this one when it was in the theater (shame on you!), rest easy. You'll probably still enjoy it on the small screen, provided your small screen isn't a 10-inch black and white number. The effects come across surprisingly good on TV. What's really interesting, though, is that when Star Wars first came out in 1977, the special effects were about two decades ahead of their time. Now, the effects are still state-of-the-art, but the rest of the industry is a lot closer to George Lucas's company now than it was 22 years ago, so we're not as overwhelmed as we were then.\nI won't bore you with plot details. Let's just say there are a lot of droids, there are empathetic, Ewok-like beings, there are lightsaber duels, and there are some cool battle scenes. What slows this production down a little are the incongruity of the Jar Jar Binks character (WHY?), and the somewhat slow pacing. For the other Star Wars movies, it felt like a lot of action was packed into a 100-minute movie; for Phantom Menace, it seemed like a lot of non-action was packed into a 120-minute movie.\n\nBottom line is this: When I saw this movie in the theaters, I loved it! Not as good as the first or third Star Wars movies, but still very good. And now that I have it on video, I'm gonna love it even more often."}

I've watched about a billion movies, and I recognized only the last guy I listed up there (Tony Todd, from Candyman). Basically, this is a movie in the young-people-scared-out-of-their-wits vein that was popularized with the Scream films. This one, fortunately, is well-written, albeit with some plot holes. Still, it's an intriguing premise. Does Death have a plan for each of us? If so, then this kid's act of getting people off the plane screwed it up royally, and now Death's really ticked off and - surprise! - one by one, the survivors are picked off. But this is a tiny cut about the standard people-being-killed-one-by-one movie. It's not just a matter of how people are killed in this movie; that would be the easy, tried-and-true method. In Final Destination, the fun is in figuring out who's next, and if the premise is to be believed (that Death does have a plan), then the mystery of who is supposed to die next will keep you guessing. There's some pleasure in figuring out who's next, since there are some characters you kind of hope get it sooner rather than later. That said, the acting is nothing to speak of - rather bland, really - and the direction itself is really bad. But the story's interesting and the effects, gory as they are, are frighteningly realistic. PRO: Story, effects. You want blood, you got it! CON: Acting, directing, effects.

If you're not into heavy science fiction, don't worry. There's a good reason this thing's rated PG, and it's not just for a lack of violence and naughty language. While 2001: A Space Odyssey was cerebral, Mission to Mars is a little like that movie's sequel, 2010: The Year We Make Contact, in that there's no overwhelming mysticism that can only be dealt with through the use of non-prescription drugs. Don't get me wrong, 2001 was a magnificent movie, but I've always suspected that being in tune with an alternate reality was the best way to view it.\nMission to Mars is about the journey of the second such undertaking to Mars. Its mission: find out what happened to the first mission. Sounds a little like 2010 there, too. Tim Robbins is the commander, and all his team has to go on is a last-minute transmission by the last mission's commander, Don Cheadle. Luckily, we in the audience see what's happened: The first team, on one of those standard reconnaissance, rock-finding, fact-finding tours, finds a big rock that uses a tornado to shoot lots and lots of little rocks at them. And that's pretty much all we know till the Robbins crew shows up.\nI'm not going to delve any deeper into this plotline, because it's not as complex as all that. Because we know so very little about space and its floating inhabitants, much is left to the imagination of the screenwriter, who in turn uses that lack of knowledge into a mysterious aura. Somehow, everything has to MEAN something in a space movie.\nThe acting is fine, but nothing to speak of. Hey, you're not looking at sci-fi for acting, are you? Robbins is earnest, but he's unfortunately miscast. Sinise is.. Well, he's Gary Sinise. He's convincing, he's believable, and he's ultimately the best character in the movie. The rest of the cast is able, but not terribly noteworthy, except for two possible exceptions. Don Cheadle (the commander from the first mission) is very good, showing even more promise than his earlier work in Volcano and Devil in a Blue Dress. And the eminent German actor Armin Mueller-Stahl is solid as their ground-control commander.\nAll in all, well done, and worth a look in the theater. I wouldn't recommend waiting for video, because the effects are definitely best appreciated on the big screen."}

Stamp, an acclaimed British actor, here plays a Cockney old boy bent on finding out who caused his estranged daughter to die and exacting revenge on them.\nSo what's the movie really about? Tough to say, really. In some ways, it's a lot like just about any other revenge movie you've seen (remember Mel Gibson in Payback?), but in other ways it's just off-kilter enough to set itself apart from standard-issue action movies. Stamp's character, Wilson, is tough to understand, so that alone might be enough to turn off viewers, but at least the movie itself makes note of that, as several characters ask him what in the hell he's saying. I think it's always a good sign when a movie is smart enough to make fun of itself and not take itself so seriously, especially when the movie is a mindless action movie. Sadly, however, the action portion of this movie is a little lacking, as if someone took a giant twisty straw and sucked all of the volatility out of it. Sure, Wilson's bent on revenge, and you can all now shrug your shoulders as you all say, \"So?\" I'm with you on that, and I just saw the damn thing. The good news is that since this was directed by the same guy who did Out of Sight with George Clooney, the direction really is an asset. Not enough of an asset, unfortunately, to offset some of the duller moments, and of course no amount of able direction can overcome the \"Huh?\" factor induced by a moribund script.\nPRO: Good camerawork, good performance by Stamp, good direction.\nCON: Dull for an action movie, motivations are cloudy, and that Cockney accent needs translating"}

This is in direct opposition to the way most of the other Hollywood movies, which assumes the audience knows next to nothing. The difference is that these inside-Hollywood movies tend to rely too much on jokes and clever asides that only make sense to someone involved with the making of movies. I'm sure Albert Brooks was clapping himself on the back after he turned this script in to the studio. Trouble is, most of us DON'T make movies. I know, Hollywood, it's tough to comprehend, isn't it?\n\nAnyway, Brooks is a struggling screenwriter who's seen better days. The studio is releasing him from his lucrative contract and says he's over the hill and has lost his edge. Luckily, Brooks has best pal Jeff Bridges (not playing himself) to offer him a way out: a muse. Now, it's time to suspend your belief...Enter Sharon Stone, playing an elegant, presumptuous, magnanimous dilettante, who offers to 'inspire' Brooks to help him regain that valuable edge. Is she a muse or not? She needs to be put up at the Four Seasons, then their guest house, then their bedroom. She has specific dietary requirements. She's finicky about everything. And while she's supposed to be helping poor Albert, she's spending more time with everyone else - including Brooks' wife, Andie MacDowell!\nHow much you like this movie will depend on your tolerance of Albert Brooks. He's still the poor man's Woody Allen, but his humor can be both dead-on and deadening. Go with the premise, and you'll be a happier viewer."}

In this case, the perpetrators are two young women (Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale), who tell their folks they're going to Hawaii but instead head to Thailand for a week and a half. Well, as you can imagine, the idyllic paradise isn't quite all that, and our protagonists spend some time in a nasty, icky women's prison (called Brokedown Palace). Interestingly, an early scene in Thailand has the girls jumping on a bed, screaming because of a cockroach. But as soon as they're arrested, that naive waif-like attitude is gone, and suddenly they're tough as raw beef. \nThe key to this story is whether Danes and Beckinsale can draw you in, get some sympathy from you. Sadly, neither one does this. Both performances are rather one-note; there's hardly any character development in a movie that cries out for it. In fact, many of the lines are delivered so badly that you almost have to keep yourself from laughing out loud - although surely this is no comedy! Bill Pullman plays a cagey lawyer (conveniently married to a Thai) who pleads their case. As a crusty, veteran, world-weary, seen-it-all barrister, Pullman does fine work, although you have to question his judgement in some scenes.\nAll in all, not as compelling as it should have been.

Many critics are also full of deer feces. Seriously, I can't imagine people actually thinking this is an incredible movie - unless they're in awe of Kubrick, who brought to the world many magnificent films, including \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" \"Barry Lyndon,\" \"A Clockwork Orange,\" and \"Paths of Glory.\" Kubrick is indeed an auteur, but here he missed the boat. The late director, who also served as screenwriter, gives us a 2.5-hour piece of slop, as we follow Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) through a series of curious, if not altogether interesting, experiences. First he and Mrs. Dr. Bill (Nicole Kidman) go to a lavish party where each is kinda tempted to cheat on the other, but doesn't. Then they discuss it later and typical marital understanding ensues. Yes, you can almost recite the lines before they happen in that scene, folks. Angry, Bill leaves his wife, runs into a cheap (and, apparently, kind-hearted, JUST the kind of prostitute that's on the streets today, one can easily imagine) hooker, goes to a jazz club, and finally goes to a masquerade-cum-orgy ball. \nThe first problem hits you right away. For a couple who are married in real life, Kidman and Cruise have zero chemistry in this film. They don't play off each other well at all, and even the mild sex scenes are real yawners. Beyond that is the script itself. One gets the impression that Kubrick had a much more developed movie in mind, but when he died the studio just released whatever was lying around. The script could have been so intriguing! The main problem with it is that is simply doesn't follow through on any premises. When a small storyline is introduced, it's just left after that brief introduction. And folks, when we're talking about a 159-minute movie, that's not easy to do. Which brings me to the last big problem of the movie. Every actor talks..... really...... slowly. Don't ask me why. And since Kubrick declined to use much in the way of background music (except for one annoyingly repetitive riff, meant to portend great ominence or something), the pauses between syllables are even more prolonged. \nSo what we're left with is overblown, overstated, pretentious piffle. It's almost as if the auteur took bits of every art-house smash he'd ever scene and thrown them into a Cuisinart. Problem is the product is a gooey concoction of superficial gunk."}

They're attacked a few times along the way, in the middle of the night as the fog rolls in (eerie!), and are stunned to find no casualties of their attackers, even though several were killed during each skirmish. Hmm! Turns out these are flesh-eaters, always part of myth but never seen even in those times. You know, one of those stories that's been handed down from generation to generation, but it's been so long since anyone who witnessed the stories firsthand was alive that the tales are more fiction than fact. \nWell, now our boys know what they're up against, but it takes them the entire movie to really get things going. For once, Banderas is not the hero, not the swashbuckler of \"The Mask of Zorro\" or the gunslinger of \"Desperado.\" The Vikings are the tough guys, and at first they patronize the outsider who doesn't speak their language. But soon he does, and soon he's one of the gang. Here's to male bonding!\nThe plusses of this movie are its cinematography and atmosphere (even my TV set smelled a little murky) and solid action performances by a fine (and international) cast. Downside: there ARE some subtitles, especially at the beginning when the Vikings speak Nordic and Banderas stands, uncomprehending. I guess it's for his benefit as much as for our benefit that those subtitles are there, because he eventually learns the language simply by listening to them.

Umm.. Wrong! With a premise like that, the credibility of the movie goes way out the window. The legal term 'double jeopardy' means one cannot be convicted of exactly the same crime twice, not just the charge. If I were accused of killing a man at 8:30 in a bookstore in New York on November 13, 1996, then I can never again be convicted of killing that man at that time in that place on that date. All of the specifics need to be the same, not just the \"I killed a man\" part. \nBut obviously, since so many people watched and liked this movie, the actual veracity of the plot is mostly immaterial. My personal opinion is that with so many rotten ex-husbands in the world, any movie in which one gets killed TWICE is going to make beaucoup bucks! So forget the implausible plot and focus on the action and the drama. Ashley Judd is Libby Parsons, the accused woman in question. Judd turns in another of her fine performances as a woman who will do almost anything to get back to her young son, who of course was taken by the seedy husband.

You see, poor Heinrich's dream of scaling the peak isn't realized. World War II breaks out and he's taken off the mountain by Allied forces and imprisoned. He breaks out and attempts to visit Tibet, completely closed off to foreigners. Starving and cold, he eventually gains admittance, and through luck somehow becomes friends with the young Dalai Lama. It's the relationship between the two of them that changes Heinrich from a bitter, selfish, and self-absorbed young man into a diligent, thoughtful and courageous adult. At the Dalai Lama's bidding, Heinrich introduces movies to the Tibetans, and he teaches the young spiritual leader all he can about the Western world. \nPerhaps the most appealing thing about this true-to-life story is the casting of Brad Pitt as Heinrich. The man with the six-pack abs is not usually the first choice when it comes to the pensive roles, but Pitt pulls off the feat with style and a real sense of class. What's more, his character's transformation is gradual and perfectly plausible; it's not one of those one-minute-he's-a-jerk, the-next-minute-he's-a-saint transformations. This isn't easy for an actor to do, especially one with Pitt's maligned reputation. Mix in delightful cinematography with sumptuous scenes of Tibet itself, and you got yourself a fine movie.

Here's a young man who by all accounts was selfless, kind-hearted, and rather introverted. And, of course, it didn't hurt that he was also a very good baseball player too. Put him on a lineup card today and he might not be the same player. Up until a few years ago, Gehrig's record of 2,130 consecutive games played was a record, a record that many thought would stand forever. For 16 years he was in the lineup as the Yankees' first baseman, never asking out for any reason. That alone should show you how special a person Gehrig was.\nThis biography is pretty straightforward. Unlike many of its kind, it doesn't show its protagonist somehow succeeding against all odds. Gehrig didn't have an abusive mother, he wasn't beaten up by kids at school, he wasn't learning-disabled, he didn't have attention-deficit disorder, he didn't come from abject poverty. He was simply a son in a working-class, immigrant family, as many were during the early decades of this century. And that's why Gehrig is so special to so many people - he symbolises their own hopes.\nGary Cooper is aces as Gehrig, and Teresa Wright is wonderful as his wife, Eleanor. If there's anything imperfect about the movie, it's that it is...well, a little predictable. That's something biopics can't avoid, of course, so it's no big problem. But even if most of the film doesn't impress you, the final speech at Yankee Stadium - when Gehrig was suffering visibly from the disease that would eventually be named after him - will move you past tears. And even better, when Gehrig's done his brief speech, he walks offscreen. If that movie were written today, he'd play another game and hit a game-winning home run.

Since it's unlikely anyone watching this movie has been in this situation before, we can only empathize with their plight. Heck, I have no idea what I'd do if I had to make that decision. The thing is, that decision takes up about 75% of the film's run time. Only some very strong performances (by Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche) keep the pace from becoming leaden. The movie spends virtually no time showing how disgusting and sickening the prisons in this land are; the atmosphere resembles a mystery more than anything else. Will the two young men go back to paradise? For my money, the movie just spent too much time in the U.S. and not enough time overseas. Other than that, it was enjoyable, with a heartfelt ending."}

And it's chock full of the kind of fellas you'd expect to see in a band, too: the shy one, the wild one, the cute one, the smart one. Obviously these kids are patterned after the Beatles, and Tom Hanks wisely wrote into this one the fact that the ascension of the band takes place shortly after the Beatles' own climb.\n\nOverall, there's not a whole lot that's out of the ordinary for this movie. There have been countless movies about music groups or solo artists who achieved success (some against horrible odds), only to crash and burn after a short stay at the top. Some are based on fact, some are fabricated by the always-creative (!) minds of Hollywood. And this movie's not all that different. It's fairly predictable from start to finish, but what might set this apart from all the others is its undying charm. There's not an unappealing performance to be seen, including Hanks himself (and he directed, too, so if you don't like it, you know who to blame). Each of the young actors involved is very engaging, especially Tom Everett Scott as Guy, and Liv Tyler as Faye. There's not a false note in the entire movie, and these kids really light up the screen both with their musical performance and their unerring acting. It's a solid directorial debut for Hanks (if you don't include an episode of \"From the Earth to the Moon\" for HBO)."}

Hepburn plays the scared damsel-in-distress well, and she doesn't play her like a completely helpless fool, either. There are plenty of scenes that are relatively quiet, as the bad guys try to move around the apartment without Hepburn hearing them.

Can't fault the actors, though - this is an unusual role for Bacon, who here comes off as a tough, strong, blue-collar kind of guy - he and his family are close to what one might call white trash, but they're never portrayed as being mean-spirited or hateful.

It's plenty long enough for those nuances to show up, but its underlying problem is that it's just plain incomprehensible. Maybe the book's better, maybe not, but I had problems figuring out the story at all. I know the thing's set about 8,000 years into the future, (which, if I were suddenly transported there, would be very confusing to me anyway) but even at the very begining, while the story's being set up, one gets the feeling one stepped into the middle of a long tale.

Before they use it on real cops, though, they draft crooks out of prison to act as guinea pigs. This is where Washington comes in. A former cop (how convenient), Washington's been rotting in jail for years. So the cops ask him to volunteer to be a part of the experiment, and of course he agrees - but the computer he's going to be downloaded into has other plans. The 'virtual' cops are supposed to face this tough criminal in the system, you see, but the computer's decided to combine all of the nasty characteristics of famous real-life killers - and then download itself into a real, sentient being (Russell Crowe). And of course it's up to our man Washington to save the day.\nSo there you have it, folks. It's a standard cops n robbers plot moved ahead a few centuries to take advantage of modern technology. Of course, it's set in the future, which here is portrayed as busy, grimy, a bit crime-riddled.. Hmm, a lot like the present, come to think of it, and not very inventive. And the effects are nothing special, either; you'd think with virtual reality being the centerpiece you'd see some dazzling special effects. Not really. \nThe cast is good, and Crowe turns in a solid (if a bit hammy, but most bad guys are, aren't they?) performance.

No, it's not \"Stuart Little\" for the taxpaying set, it's the latest movie adapted from a Stephen King story. Specifically, \"The Green Mile\" comes from the only King story so far to be presented to the public in serial form; that is, one chapter at a time was published in separate short books.\nTom Hanks is Paul Edgecomb, the leader of the guards, already a hardened veteran of the block. His kingdom is The Green Mile, the death-row area of the prison, so named because of the color of the tile that the prisoners must walk on their way to the electric chair. One of Paul's newest prisoners is a massive black man named John Coffey, who seems completely out of place except for his size; Paul immediately senses no violence in the man.\nThe mouse is the pet of the Mile and spends most of his time in the company of one of the block's senior prisoners, Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter). The mouse himself isn't completely relevant to the plot, but his presence does serve to humanize the prisoners and to act as a bookend for the entire story, told in flashback by Paul many years later. There are many subplots, all of them surrounding Paul and his crew as they deal with John Coffey and the other prisoners, but none of them seems incongruous, and that's a major asset to a film like this. Running three hours, it's easy to mix in multiple plot lines, of course, but you don't want your audience falling asleep on you. Frank Darabont, who helmed that other Stephen King prison story (\"The Shawshank Redemption\"), does an extraordinary job selecting just the right camera angles and keeping the pace of the film consistent. This, along with \"Shawshank,\" is a rare bird: a film adapted from a Stephen King story that actually works well on the screen. Most of the King adaptations out there - and there have been a LOT! - have been lackluster and lacking. King's greatest quality as a writer is his exposition and character development, and most films don't have the time or patience to carry that quality over. Both of Darabont's do. \nAs for the cast, there are no slackers. Hanks is gritty and convincing in the lead, and his fine support includes David Morse as a fellow guard and James Cromwell as the prison's warden. All acquit themselves wonderfully, allowing the viewer to be drawn into the story effortlessly."}

Not to Malkovich's HOUSE, mind you, not to his office, but into his actual mind. Yes folks, it's an existential conundrum of a movie. What's it like to be John Malkovich, you wonder?

In the opening scene he is finishing a read of a script he just KNOWS will make him a star. Before too long, Bowfinger's pitching the movie to the industry's #1 action star, Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy). Ramsey, of course, isn't too inclined to take on the project, and seems a little unbalanced himself. Seems he's seeing a therapist on the side who has been advising him to \"keep it together\" (Keep It Together = KIT - get it?). \nSo since Kit won't do the project, and Bowfinger's already told his cast and crew he WILL do it, what's a forlorn director to do? That's right, shoot the movie without Kit knowing it! There are six scenes with Kit's character, so Bowfinger shoots all the others as normal, then has to use a little trickery to finish the others. At first he shoots them actually WITH Kit, although of course Kit has no idea he's being filmed; for closeup scenes, he auditions lookalikes for the part. The winner is a decidedly unstylish, non-suave dork named Jif (also played by Murphy, who's experienced at playing multiple roles). \nOf course, the resolution of this movie isn't tough to figure out - will Bowfinger get his movie in the can, with or without Kit knowing - but it's the getting to that resolution that's the real fun. Martin's a real treat as the over-the-top, get-this-movie-done-at-all-costs Bowfinger, and it's a role he absolutely plays to the hilt. And I doubt this movie would have been a big deal at all if Murphy wasn't cast in it. I've always enjoyed him when he does multiple roles, which he's done in several of his films, but the spins he put on both Kit and Jif were tremendous! I sincerely doubt any other actor could have pulled off the feat as well as Murphy did, and who knows - maybe it'll resuscitate his career. \nThe script is crisp, and there are hardly any slackers in the entire cast. One of the best is the lovely Heather Graham, who has shown her acting chops (among other things) to us in \"Boogie Nights,\" \"Lost in Space,\" and \"Swingers,\" to name a few. Graham plays Daisy, a just-off-the-bus-from-Ohio naif who sleeps her way from the cameraman to the screenwriter to the director to make sure her scenes are in the film. Frank Oz is the director, but I don't think he had a lot to do with the overall success of the film. He's directed a few Steve Martin films before (\"Housesitter\" and \"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\"), and my instinct tells me that he kind of stepped back and let Martin and Murphy do their thing."}

A tense thriller involving maniacs with agendas using bombs to further their cause. Coming on the heels of such tragedies as the Oklahoma City, World Trade Center, and Olympics bombings, this film deals with the issue of the paranoia that everyday people experience when they suspect their neighbor of illicit activities.\nBridges plays Michael Faraday, a college professor who (conveniently) teaches a class on terrorism and how it's affected innocent people in recent years. Seems Michael's wife, an FBI agent, was killed during an FBI operation involving extremists. So you can understand if he's a little...emotional while teaching his class. The movie opens rather strikingly: As Michael pulls into his street, he sees a child staggering down the street. Turns out the kid's nearly blown his hand off playing with fireworks, and he's the kid of the new people across the street.\nWell, to cut to the chase, it's not long before Michael is suspicious of his new neighbors, specifically Oliver (Tim Robbins). He's been wary of people during the years since his wife's death, and there are a few things Oliver says that just don't seem right to Michael. He checks them out, and with each passing minute, we as an audience become more and more fearful for Michael and his young son. Are his fears justified?\nIt's not that the acting is bad in this; it really isn't. In fact, it's a new kind of role for Robbins, who generally plays nice guy/hero types. (Maybe Susan Sarandon put him up to it.) And the actors play their roles with conviction, which is crucial in a movie like this, because the audience has to feel like it can relate to the characters on a somewhat personal level. Both leads pull that feat off neatly, but only on a small level, such as when they're dealing with their female counterparts or their children. But neither actor succeeds in completely pulling in the audience to see their story. We don't learn much about Oliver until the end - what we do learn is spotty and subjective, to say the least. I watched this movie and knew I was supposed to be rooting for Michael, but I honestly found some of his actions a little odd and a little deplorable. Sure, he may have been justified in being suspicious from the get-go, but was he justified in going to the lengths he did to find out information on his neighbors?

But I started to wonder about Michael's own actions - was his invasion of privacy justified? Wasn't he sinking almost as low as his neighbors (allegedly), albeit in a different way? Are we supposed to condone his behavior in the name of supposed justice?\nAdmittedly, the ending isn't what I expected, but it's still unsatisfying. I'm not sure what the point of it was, either.

You think you have problems? The young ladies at the elite institution have all sorts of mental maladies, some seemingly harmless and some bent on destruction. Is Susanna the only sane one? Even she isn't sure - she's the only one of her graduating high school class who didn't have collegiate plans, a fact that's drummed into her by each authority figure she comes into contact with. Finally, when Susanna chases a bottle of aspirin with a bottle of vodka, her parents have her committed - for a 'rest.'\nThis film appears to pull no punches when it comes to dealing with insanity and the people directly affected by it. While none of the secondary characters is really fleshed out, it's clear the emphasis is on Susanna and how she relates to the madness surrounding her. It's a staggeringly difficult dilemma - are you insane, or are you just struggling like everyone else? There are similarities in this movie to \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and even to the comedic \"The Dream Team,\" but what sets this apart from the others in this genre are the performances, particularly by Ryder. It's never easy to play someone who's handicapped, despite all appearances to the contrary, but what Ryder needed to do was convey a character who may or may not be a borderline personality, not a clear-cut case. This is a task the actress tackles with gusto. While others in the role might tend to overstate their character's plight or actions, Ryder takes the subtle approach, reining in her actions and reactions enough to allow the viewer to empathize fully with her.\nThe flip side of that approach is displayed by Jolie, who is so far over the top with her portrayal of Lisa that the viewer never gets a chance to root for her. In the face of tragedy and suffering, Lisa laughs sarcastically and generally makes people feel worse than ever. It's obvious from the start that this is a defense mechanism, but like Jack Nicholson's character in \"The Shining,\" because we never see Lisa in a favorable light - or, more importantly, in a sane one - we're never able to like her. There's hardly a likeable aspect to Lisa, who seems to become more destructive as the movie progresses (a statement on the healing power of our mental institutions? You be the judge). In other words, Jolie's character is so completely wacked out from the get-go that no one in the audience can really care about her much, only in how she affects Susanna. Only at the end of the movie do we get a glimpse of the depth of Jolie's character, but by then you might not care."}

Try this film!", "content": "Far be it from me to come down hard on an actor like Pierce Brosnan, who has made a career out of being suave and debonair, but that kind of characterization really can only carry an actor so far. This remake of the 1968 film that starred Steve McQueen is about a multigabillionaire investment banker who happens to be an art thief.  Well, he's struck again, and it's up to the luscious Rene Russo (as an insurance investigator) to catch the thief.\nSimilarities to the more recent Entrapment abound - in that one, Sean Connery was the suave rich fella with an eye for art, and Catherine Zeta-Jones was the sexy insurance investigator. The problem with that film might have been the romance between Zeta-Jones and Connery, who easily is old enough to be her grandfather. In this film, the two characters appear to rather close in age, so at least that quibble doesn't exist.\n\nSo let's see what we have. We know right from the beginning that Crown has stolen yet another priceless work of art, so that bit of suspense is gone. And we know that our friendly neighborhood insurance investigator (did you know they can be sexy, too? Who knew?) will nab him not by catching him in the act but by - ahem - pretending to fall for him so she can learn his methods and turn him in as an insider. When you know your 'good guy' is willing to risk it all to get her man, you know her credibility is shot. The chances of her keeping her head above water and not falling for him are incredibly slim, and we know that as the movie progresses we'll see Crown as less of a thief and more of a victim. Ho-hum.\nNow that I've blasted the script, let's look at the actors' work. Brosnan plays Crown pretty much the way you'd expect him to - aloof, cunning, intelligent - kind of like a James Bond Lite. He doesn't bring a whole lot of excitement to the role, other than the fact that he's Pierce Brosnan. As far as Russo goes - well, she did several inexplicable gratuitous nude (topless, anyway) scenes in this film. Now, sometimes gratuitous nudity is okay in my book - it can distract you from an otherwise dull film. But it seems to me the only reason Russo - an accomplished actress - would consent to showing her breasts is to demonstrate she's not bad-looking ... for a woman in her forties. Other than for vanity reasons, there's no reason in the world for her to get naked. (And for what it's worth, I kind of wish Catherine Zeta-Jones had done the same in Entrapment!)\nFor me, this movie wasn't even good as escapist fare. Quite frankly, a suspense movie with no suspense has little going for it, although the lush production locations did ease the boredom a little."}

Add that trend to the trend of having less-than-superheroes as the protagonists of their own films, and you get Mystery Men as a result.\nThis movie is about the efforts of a disparate group of five 'heroes' to thwart an Evil Guy in his attempts to do something-or-other to a fictional city. (It's conflicts like these that are the staple of many a comic book, aren't they?)Will our heroes save the day? Is there water in the ocean? Of course they will!\nSo what kind of heroes do we have? Well, we have Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), whose superpower is that he's..... well, furious; The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria), who throws his mother's cutlery and speaks with a British accent, even though he's neither British not clad in blue; The Spleen (Paul Reubens), whose flatulence will level people for several yards; The Shoveler (William H. Macy), whose prowess with the titular garden implement is legendary; The Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), who tosses a bowling ball that happens to house the skull of her dead father, himself a noteworthy bowler; and Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), who only turns invisible if absolutely no one is looking at him at the time.\nLet's face facts here. This is not a complex movie. You know who your good guys are and you know who the bad guy is (Geoffrey Rush, in an ineffectual performance). You might not be entirely clear on what the bad guy wants to accomplish, but who gives a darn anyway? The characters all seem to be having a grand old time, and there's good chemistry between them (although it would have been nice to see more interplay between Stiller and Garofalo, who have been close friends in real life for a long time).\n\nBottom line is this: You won't be offended by much in Mystery Men (unless you can't stomach fart jokes), but your mind won't be terribly stimulated, either. All in all, it's a fair-to-middling kind of movie - the kind that makes you feel a little unsatisfied when it's over, like maybe it didn't quite fulfill its potential."}

Hilarious hijinks follow, involving miscommunication and mistaken identity. \nOk, so since Grant's such an appealing guy and is playing an appealing character, we know he'll somehow triumph in the end. But that's not why we're watching, is it? The thing is, this movie would seem rather pedestrian if it weren't for the performance James Caan turns in as the father. You expect, from the previews, that Grant will have to pass himself off as a Mafia guy to someone - if this were a normal film, that someone would be the girl's father. Not this time! Caan's in on it, and that's where a lot of the fun in Mickey Blue Eyes comes into play. Nothing's funnier than seeing Hugh Grant try to talk the Italian talk! So Caan's tough and funny, and Grant's endearing and bumbling, so that leaves us with only one main character to gripe about: Tripplehorn.\nI'll say it right upfront: I've never been a Tripplehorn fan. When I saw her in Basic Instinct, I was almost relieved when Michael Douglas started messing around with Sharon Stone. And when I saw her in Waterworld, I looked for another female character just so Kevin Costner wouldn't have to be with her. (Darn the luck.) I don't think she's very talented as an actress, with a very limited range of expression. And she's not even good-looking, with a hideous overbite that would put a beaver to shame. And that wouldn't be as much of a problem if she weren't in all these movies playing attractive, sexual women (except for Basic Instinct, of course). Watching her slobber all over Hugh Grant made my stomach churn and my skin crawl.\n\nBut seriously, that's just a minor quibble.

Clouseau, of course, insists she's innocent and that he will prove it! Which just accelerates the process of driving his boss (Herbert Lom) insane. Clouseau, determined that Sommer is innocent, releases her from jail, thinking she'll lead him to the real culprit. Of course, other people die along the way, and each time Sommer's put back into jail, Clouseau doggedly releases her. The best part of the film? A scene in a nudist colony, where the bashful Clouseau must find Sommer and talk to her - when the police arrive to investigate yet another murder, they both leave the colony sans clothing. The sight of them driving through the streets of Paris completely nude (although we don't see anything naughty, of course) is priceless.\nIf you want to see Pink Panther films, do yourself a favor and begin with this one - it's as flawless as Clouseau is incompetent!"}

The hook for Porky's was that you got to see a little nudity, which was a big deal to a teenager in the early eighties. Pie surpasses the raunch and adds dollops of good, solid, vivid, and (especially) authentic characterizations. While the kids in Porky's were fairly stereotypical, the kids in Pie are.... well, typical, really. \nOf course, some things never change, and the driving force of the story in Pie is that males just wanna get laid, while females want it to be just right.

Quite a lot to cram into 90 minutes, but not only does the film not skip a beat while delivering these goods, it does so with such honesty that you'll very rarely see in a so-called teen film of the late nineties.

This white-knuckle thriller features some of the crispest dialog you'll see in the movies. The characterizations are vivid and intelligent, and the audience is treated to some real crackerjack performances.\nYou see, the best part of this movie isn't guessing whether the authorities are going to submit to Shaw's demands and give the gunmen their money, it's in wondering how he plans on getting away with the crime. You have four gunmen with automatic weapons on a single subway car in the middle of a tunnel. There are cops surrounding them everywhere, although none can quite get close enough to the car to commandeer it. How do they propose to do it?\nLike some movies that purport to develop in 'real time,' (like High Noon and Nick of Time), this movie seems to take place in precisely the hour or so that Matthau and company try to win the battle of wits with Shaw and company. But it never seems like it, as the rapid pacing of the script take care of any possible lulls. Matthau himself is brilliant, as he offers an award-worthy performance. Shaw matches him move-for-move as his evil counterpart. His character names the men in his gang after colors, much like Quentin Tarantino would later do in Reservoir Dogs."}

But before Bobby was cast (and cast and cast and cast)as Hollywood's chief badfella, he co-starred in this adaptation of a novel by Mark Harris as a simpleton baseball catcher who may be dying.\nMany people feel that playing a sick or handicapped character is relatively easy for an actor, but in truth there's more to acting than simply limping or slurring one's speech. DeNiro's character, we learn early on, is dying - just when his chances of sticking with the big club are tenuous at best. His best friend is played by Michael Moriarty, whose character is a seasoned, talented pitcher. Moriarty learns of DeNiro's fate during an off season, and decides to do all he can to help his friend, to make what life he has left a pleasant one.\nBoth actors turn in magnificent performances, but you can't beat this film for an excellent foretelling of a major talent. By 1973, DeNiro had acted in a few movies (including a couple from his once and future director, Brian DePalma), but it was his astounding work in this film that really put him on the map. His Bruce Pearson isn't just a simpleton for whom the audience is supposed to feel a truckload of sympathy - there are many television movies that do just that - he's a multilayered person. DeNiro squeezes more emotion out of a single sideways smile than many actors can do in their entire careers. What's more, even though you the viewer know what Pearson's fate is, you're no less pulling for him. \nCall this a tearjerker, and you'd be correct.

Many have had ensemble casts in them that took a back seat to the wartime action. This classic focuses on bombers being pushed to their absolute physical and emotional limits. Their commander, Gary Merrill, begins to show signs of the strain and is replaced by his superiors, who feel he's becoming too attached to the soldiers (as opposed to focusing on the war objectives). The man who ordered the replacement, Gregory Peck, is ordered to take over for Merrill. But how long before Peck falls become what he loathes - a commander who runs on emotion and defies logic and orders?\nLike many wartime movies, this one is chock full of action scenes. Peck pushes his soldiers to accomplish their bombing goals, doing all he can to improve morale and give his men something to fight for. Unlike many war movies, which had the soldiers fighting blindly, going grimly into battle without knowing why, this one makes the point that the men perform better knowing what their objectives are. In other words, the whole issue of war as reducing man to his basest state is touched on very neatly. These are not automatons programmed to do battle, these are real, thinking, breathing humans.\nThe acting is fantastic, with Peck getting a chance to play a little out of character as the tough commander.

In the present day, we see so many scandals involving upper-crust politicians (including, but not limited to, the President), that we have become jaded to their importance. In 1974, though, this scandal marked the first time a president's authority and character had been publicly questioned. The two main characters are two 15-year-old girls - one the only offspring of a single mother (who is played by Teri Garr) and the other the only sister in a standard nuclear family, complete with a pothead older brother who's about to be drafted. The events of the times are swirling around these two young ladies, but we see them all through their eyes. Some of us know about the events of the early 1970s because we were there, and others of us know about them through history books or from our elders. But now we get to see these events as they pertain to two teenagers. It's interesting how the basic character of a teenager hasn't changed - these girls dismiss Watergate and Vietnam initially and are more concerned with teen idols, school, and, well, teenager stuff. Admittedly, the plot's a little contrived, but it never makes the mistake of taking itself seriously. One of the girls happens to live in the Watergate Hotel, and late one night they both innocently learn of the break-in. They subsequently get to meet many key Watergate players, including Haldemann, Liddy, Wooodward, Bernstein, Kissinger, and, of course, Nixon himself.\n The most amazing thing about this script is that while nothing is really historically revised to tell the tale, the girls' characters are used to supply details of these historical events that may answer some old questions. What happened to the section that Nixon's secretary chopped from the illegal tape? Who was Deep Throat, anyway? The 'answers' to these questions will make you laugh.\nAs for the acting, it's absolutely perfect. Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams are a real treat as the giggly, naive teenage girls. Their characters are very well-written - at no point do they do something that seems out of character. But the biggest treat of all is Dan Hedaya as Nixon. Some people can do Nixon impressions, and some ARE Nixon. Hedaya captures the feel for the ex-President, from his creepy scowl when trying to be friendly to his state of panic when the truth of the scandal finally set in. He's the best thing going in this film, and possibly should be nominated for his work."}

(Stowe's a good choice for the role, but her character is very superficially drawn.) We run into colonels, captains, privates, and more as Travolta and Stowe search for clues and... well, basically do detective stuff. \nNow, I'm certainly not going to give away the killer, but let's just say the writers didn't take much time in picking his identity, and you as viewer likely won't, either. Travolta undertakes his task with a sort of grim determination, with the kind of jaw-clenching superheroism you'd expect from maybe.... Superman, or something. There's not a whole lot he can do with the role, but you sort of get the sense that Travolta's a little miscast.\n\nBasic plot? While Travolta tries to find out the killer's identity, the Army just wants to keep a lid on the whole episode, and they want it solved before the FBI comes in (conveniently, 36 hours after the crime). Ever see \"A Soldier's Story,\" which came out years ago and had a very similar plot? In that movie, there were plenty of twists and turns. In place of twists and turns in this movie, we have predictability and the aura of should-have-seen-it-coming. \nThis is not a bad movie. In fact, it has earnest performances by Travolta, Stowe, James Woods, and James Cromwell (and a surprisingly effective one by Clarence Williams III!). The problem is that it's a little underplotted and a little too easy to follow. Instead of taking the viewer on a path to the truth that is swamped in a traffic jam of turns, this script takes a direct route. It makes for relatively uninteresting cinema."}

We've all seen films in which the protagonist is foolhardy and illogical in his never-ending quest for justice. Smith's Jim West comes off as selfish instead of philanthropic, thick-headed instead of cunning, smug instead of suave. He's not a daring secret agent - he's nothing more than a stereotypical arrogant cop.\nSmith gives the worst performance in the film, but he's not alone. While Kevin Kline (as Artemus Gordon)and Salma Hayek come off okay, Kenneth Branaugh (yes, the Shakesperian!!) is all wrong as the evil Dr. Loveless. He's way, way, way over the top. For someone who once played Hamlet, this is a major comedown. Can anyone say \"Orson Welles\"? I knew you could! Remember when, years after Welles did Macbeth and was a regular in Shakespeare's plays on Broadway, he was found in horrible dreck like Transformers and Slapstick of Another Kind. Is this once-great actor wandering down this path? He may not have Welles' corpulence, but he sure has the hamminess!\nAll in all, this is a waste of energy. Special effects are fine, but in this day and age, they're really not all that special, are they?"}

Think of The Odd Couple and you have a good idea of a 'good' Simon film.\nLemmon's character, Mel, is a Manhattan businessman who's going through a bit of a midlife crisis. We've seen this sort of thing before in the movies - Lord knows we have!! - but the problem is, we've seen it much better. There's a fine line to be walked here between maudlin and funny/touching, and sadly that line is crossed early on in the movie and never recrossed.\nMel suffers through a lot of problems in this movie, and your closeness to NYC life will dictate just how much sympathy you have for his plight. But be warned: Simon doesn't combat these problems with wit and wisdom; to me, Mel just yells and screams and basically is thoroughly obnoxious - only Anne Bancroft as his suffering wife gives an appealing performance.\nBottom line is that unless you're a diehard Simon or Lemmon fan, you might want to avoid this collection of angst, agita, and aneurysms waiting to happen."}

The closest heir is Jack (Peter O'Toole), who enters the castle and announces he's actually Jesus Christ. The family plays along at first so that they may live off his money forever, but soon his ''act'' wears thin - and they plot against him! Taut upper-class comedy gives us some very rich, well-defined characters. This isn't the most functional family in the world - these people are downright nasty! With adultery, murder, and snobbery available in copious amounts, there's hardly a limit to the comedic possibilities.\nBut this is clearly O'Toole's show. His delivery of some very difficult - and very intelligent - lines made him worthy of an Oscar nomination. Remember him in The Lion in Winter as Henry II? Same regal arrogance, the kind of quality that will cause males to rise up in anger and females to swoon at his feet. Contrast O'Toole's performance here with the one he presents in The Stunt Man. Different setting, different character, but both seem to think of themselves as The Almighty - or a reasonable facsimile. This is O'Toole at his finest."}
< {"rating": "9", "date": "19 December 1999", "title_id": "tt0059646", "user_id": "ur0543054", "title": "A masterful psychological film, great early Polanski", "content": "Director Roman Polanski, in a delicious homage to Alfred Hitchcock, concocted a genuinely creepy thriller about a beautiful, repressed young woman (played to perfection by the elegant Catherine Deneuve, in one of her first films)who has been left alone in her apartment for a weekend while her sister is away. For the normal person, having the savvy to survive a weekend alone is a simple task; for the childlike Carol, however, it's the gateway to a descent into utter madness. Footsteps in a hallway induce paranoia in poor Carol, and despite the attempts of a possible suitor, she becomes more and more afraid and, ultimately, violent.\nWhat makes this movie scary is Polanski's magnificent, minimalistic use of lighting and effects. As a result, the viewer feels as if he or she is in the room with Carol, and that he or she is feeling what she is feeling. This is no simple feat; almost all of the current horror directors out there will compensate for not being able to get into the minds of their protagonists by overemphasizing special effects. To me, the scariest, creepiest movies are the ones that are the most real - the ones that make you feel as if this situation could conceivably happen to you. And this is where Polanski succeeded. I would very highly recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates scary movies for being scary, rather than for being hidden under a thick mask of gore and screams."}
